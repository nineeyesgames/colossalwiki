<b>Sicily</b> (<a>Italian</a>: <i>Sicilia</i><small></small><span><a>[siˈtʃiːlja]</a></span> ; <a>Sicilian</a>: <i>Sicilia</i><small></small><span><a>[sɪˈʃiːlja]</a></span> ) is the <a>largest island</a> in the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a> and one of the 20 <a>regions</a> of <a>Italy</a>. It is one of the five <a>Italian autonomous regions</a> and is officially referred to as <i>Regione Siciliana</i>. The region has 5 million inhabitants. Its <a>capital city</a> is <a>Palermo</a>.

</p>
<p>
Sicily is in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the <a>Italian Peninsula</a>, from which it is separated by the narrow <a>Strait of Messina</a>. Its most prominent landmark is <a>Mount Etna</a>, one of the tallest active volcanoes in Europe,<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> and one of the most active in the world, currently 3,357 m (11,014 ft) high. The island has a typical <a>Mediterranean climate</a>.

</p>
<p>
The earliest <a>archaeological evidence</a> of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> By around 750 BC, Sicily had three <a>Phoenician</a> and a dozen <a>Greek colonies</a> and it was later the site of the <a>Sicilian Wars</a> and the <a>Punic Wars</a>. After the end of the Roman province of <a>Sicilia</a> with the fall of the <a>Roman Empire</a> in the 5th century AD, Sicily was ruled during the <a>Early Middle Ages</a> by the <a>Vandals</a>, the <a>Ostrogoths</a>, the <a>Byzantine Empire</a>, and the <a>Emirate of Sicily</a>. The <a>Norman conquest of southern Italy</a> led to the creation of the <a>County of Sicily</a> in 1071, that was succeeded by <a>Kingdom of Sicily</a>, a state that existed from 1130 until 1816.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> Later, it was unified under the <a>House of Bourbon</a> with the <a>Kingdom of Naples</a> as the <a>Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a>. The island became part of <a>Italy</a> in 1860 following the <a>Expedition of the Thousand</a>, a revolt led by <a>Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> during the <a>Italian unification</a>, and a plebiscite. Sicily was given special status as an <a>autonomous region</a> on 15 May 1946, 18 days before the <a>Italian institutional referendum of 1946</a>.

</p>
<p>
Sicily has a rich and unique culture, especially with regard to the <a>arts</a>, <a>music</a>, <a>literature</a>, <a>cuisine</a>, and <a>architecture</a>. It is also home to important <a>archaeological</a> and ancient sites, such as the <a>Necropolis of Pantalica</a>, the <a>Valley of the Temples</a>, <a>Erice</a> and <a>Selinunte</a>. <a>Byzantine</a>, <a>Arab</a>, <a>Roman</a> and <a>Norman</a> rule over Sicily has led to a blend of cultural influences.

<p>
Sicily has a roughly triangular shape, earning it the name <i>Trinacria</i>.
To the north-east, it is separated from <a>Calabria</a> and the rest of the Italian mainland by the <a>Strait of Messina</a>, about 3 km (1.9 mi) wide in the north, and about 16 km (9.9 mi) wide in the southern part.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> The northern and southern coasts are each about 280 km (170 mi) long measured as a straight line, while the eastern coast measures around 180 km (110 mi); total coast length is <a>estimated</a> at 1,484 km (922 mi). The total area of the island is 25,711 km<sup>2</sup> (9,927 sq mi),<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> while the <a>Autonomous Region</a> of Sicily (which includes smaller surrounding islands) has an area of 27,708 km<sup>2</sup> (10,698 sq mi).<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The terrain of inland Sicily is mostly hilly and is intensively cultivated wherever possible. Along the northern coast, the mountain ranges of <a>Madonie</a>, 2,000 m (6,600 ft), <a>Nebrodi</a>, 1,800 m (5,900 ft), and <a>Peloritani</a>, 1,300 m (4,300 ft), are an extension of the mainland <a>Apennines</a>. The cone of <a>Mount Etna</a> dominates the eastern coast. In the southeast lie the lower <a>Hyblaean Mountains</a>, 1,000 m (3,300 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> The mines of the <a>Enna</a> and <a>Caltanissetta</a> districts were part of a leading <a>sulphur</a>-producing area throughout the 19th century, but have declined since the 1950s.

</p>
<p>
Sicily and its surrounding small islands have some highly active volcanoes. This is due to the fact Sicily is geographically on the northern edge of the <a>African continental plate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> Mount Etna is the largest active volcano in Europe and still casts black ash over the island with its ever-present eruptions. It currently stands 3,329 metres (10,922 ft) high, though this varies with summit eruptions; the mountain is 21 m (69 ft) lower now than it was in 1981. It is the highest mountain in Italy south of the <a>Alps</a>. Etna covers an area of 1,190 km<sup>2</sup> (459 sq mi) with a basal circumference of 140 km (87 mi). This makes it by far the largest of the three <a>active volcanoes in Italy</a>, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, <a>Mount Vesuvius</a>. In <a>Greek mythology</a>, the deadly monster <a>Typhon</a> was trapped under the mountain by <a>Zeus</a>, the god of the sky.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> Mount Etna is widely regarded as a cultural symbol and icon of Sicily.

</p></div></div></li></ul>
<p>
The <a>Aeolian Islands</a> in the <a>Tyrrhenian Sea</a>, to the northeast of mainland Sicily form a volcanic complex, and include <a>Stromboli</a>. 
The three volcanoes of <a>Vulcano</a>, <a>Vulcanello</a> and <a>Lipari</a> are also currently active, although the latter is usually dormant. Off the southern coast of Sicily, the underwater volcano of <a>Ferdinandea</a>, which is part of the larger <a>Empedocles volcano</a>, last erupted in 1831. It is located between the coast of <a>Agrigento</a> and the island of <a>Pantelleria</a> (which itself is a dormant volcano).

</p>
<p>
From a geographical perspective, also forming a part of Sicily is the Maltese Archipelago, the islands home to the <a>republic of Malta</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>autonomous region</a> also includes several neighbouring islands: the <a>Aegadian Islands</a>, the Aeolian Islands, Pantelleria and <a>Lampedusa</a>.

<p>
The island is <a>drained</a> by several rivers, most of which flow through the central area and enter the sea at the south of the island. The <a>Salso</a> flows through parts of Enna and Caltanissetta before entering the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a> at the port of <a>Licata</a>. To the east, the <a>Alcantara</a> flows through the province of <a>Messina</a> and enters the sea at <a>Giardini Naxos</a>, and the <a>Simeto</a>, which flows into the <a>Ionian Sea</a> south of <a>Catania</a>. Other important rivers on the island are the <a>Belice</a> and <a>Platani</a> in the southwest.

<p>
Sicily has a typical <a>Mediterranean climate</a> with mild and wet winters and hot, dry summers with very changeable intermediate seasons. On the coasts, especially in the south-west, the climate is affected by the African currents and summers can be scorching.

</p>
<p>
Snow falls above 900–1000 metres, but it can fall in the hills. The interior mountains, especially <a>Nebrodi</a>, <a>Madonie</a>, and <a>Etna</a>, enjoy a full mountain climate, with heavy snowfalls during winter. The summit of Mount Etna is usually snow-capped from October to May.

</p>
<p>
On the other hand, especially in the summer, it is not unusual that there is the <a>sirocco</a>, the wind from the Sahara. Rainfall is scarce, and water proves deficient in some provinces where a water crisis can happen occasionally.

</p>
<p>
According to the Regional Agency for Waste and Water, on 10 August 1999, the weather station of <a>Catenanuova</a> (EN) recorded a maximum temperature of 48.5 °C (119 °F).<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> The official European record – measured by minimum/maximum thermometers – is held by Athens, Greece, which reported a maximum of 48.0 °C (118 °F) in 1977.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> Total precipitation is highly variable, generally increasing with elevation. In general, the southern and southeast coast receives the least rainfall (less than 50 cm (20 in)), and the northern and northeastern highlands the most (over 100 cm (39 in)).

<p>
Sicily is an often-quoted example of man-made <a>deforestation</a>, which has occurred since Roman times, when the island was turned into an agricultural region.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> This gradually dried the climate, leading to a decline in rainfall and the drying of rivers. The central and southwest provinces are practically devoid of any forest.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> In Northern Sicily, there are three important forests; near Mount Etna, in the <a>Nebrodi Mountains</a> and in the <a>Bosco della Ficuzza</a> (<a>it</a>) Natural Reserve near <a>Palermo</a>. The Nebrodi Mountains Regional Park, established on 4 August 1993 and covering 86,000 hectares (210,000 acres), is the largest protected natural area of Sicily; and contains the largest forest in Sicily, the <a>Caronia</a>. The <a>Hundred Horse Chestnut</a> (Castagno dei Cento Cavalli), in <a>Sant'Alfio</a>, on the eastern slopes of Mount Etna, is the largest and oldest known <a>chestnut</a> tree in the world at 2,000 – 4,000 years old.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Sicily has a wide variety of fauna. Species include the <a>European wildcat</a>, <a>red fox</a>, <a>least weasel</a>, <a>pine marten</a>, <a>roe deer</a>, <a>wild boar</a>, <a>crested porcupine</a>, <a>European hedgehog</a>, <a>common toad</a>, <i><a>Vipera aspis</a></i>, <a>golden eagle</a>, <a>peregrine falcon</a>, <a>Eurasian hoopoe</a> and <a>black-winged stilt</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The <a>Sicilian wolf</a> (<i>Canis lupus cristaldii</i>) was an <a>endemic</a> wolf <a>subspecies</a> that was driven to extinction in the 20th century.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Zingaro Natural Reserve</a> is one of the best examples of unspoiled coastal wilderness in Sicily.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Surrounding waters including the <a>Strait of Messina</a><a>are home to varieties of birds and marine life</a> , including larger species such as <a>greater flamingo</a> and <a>fin whale</a>.

The name <i><a>Sicilia</a></i> was given to the <a>Roman province</a> in 241 BC. It is derived from the name of the <a>Sikeloi</a>, who inhabited the eastern part of the island.
The ancient name of the island is <i>Trinacria</i> (Greek <a>Τρινακρία</a> "having three headlands") for its triangular shape, likely a re-interpretation of earlier (<a>Homeric</a>) <i><a>Thrinacia</a></i>. 
The Greek name was rendered as <i>Trīnācrĭa</i> in <a>classical Latin</a> (<a>Virgil</a>, <a>Ovid</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>

<p>
The original classical-era inhabitants of Sicily comprised three defined groups of the <a>ancient peoples of Italy</a>. The most prominent and by far the earliest of these, the <a>Sicani</a>, who (<a>Thucydides</a> writes) arrived from the <a>Iberian Peninsula</a> (perhaps <a>Catalonia</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Some modern scholars, however, suggest classifying the Sicani as possibly an <a>Illyrian</a> tribe.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> Important historical evidence has been discovered in the form of cave drawings by the Sicani, dated from the end of the <a>Pleistocene</a> epoch around 8000 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The arrival of the first humans on the island correlates with the extinction of the <a>Sicilian hippopotamus</a> and the <a>Sicilian dwarf elephant</a>. The <a>Elymians</a>, thought to have come from the area of the <a>Aegean Sea</a>, became the next tribe to join the Sicanians on Sicily.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg/220px-Dolmenmontebubbonia.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Recent discoveries of <a>dolmens</a> on the island (dating to the second half of the third millennium BC) seem to offer new insights into the culture of primitive Sicily. It is well known that the Mediterranean region went through a quite intricate prehistory, so much so that it is difficult to piece together the muddle of different peoples who have followed each other. The impact of two influences is clear, however: the European one coming from the Northwest, and the Mediterranean influence of a clear eastern heritage.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
No evidence survives of any warring between the tribes, but the Sicanians moved eastwards when the Elymians settled in the northwest corner of the island. The <a>Sicels</a> are thought<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> to have originated in <a>Liguria</a>; they arrived from mainland Italy in 1200 BC and forced the Sicanians to move back across Sicily and to settle in the middle of the island.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> Other minor <a>Italic groups</a> who settled in Sicily included the <a>Ausones</a> (<a>Aeolian Islands</a>, <a>Milazzo</a>) and the <a>Morgetes</a> of <a>Morgantina</a>.

<p>
The <a>Phoenician</a> settlements in the western part of the island predate the arrival of <a>Greek</a> colonists.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> From about 750 BC, the Greeks began to live in Sicily (<a>Ancient Greek</a>: <span>Σικελία</span> – <i>Sikelia</i>), establishing many significant settlements. The most important colony was in <a>Syracuse</a>; others grew up at <a>Akragas</a>, <a>Selinunte</a>, <a>Gela</a>, <a>Himera</a> and <a>Zancle</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> The native Sicani and Sicel peoples became <a>absorbed</a> into the <a>Hellenic culture</a> with relative ease, and the area became part of <i><a>Magna Graecia</a></i> - along with the coasts of the <a>south of the Italian peninsula</a>, which the Greeks had also colonised. Sicily had very fertile soils, and the successful introduction of <a>olives</a> and <a>grape vines</a> fostered a great deal of profitable trading.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><a>Greek culture</a>  significantly included <a>Greek religion</a>, and the settlers built many <a>temples</a> throughout Sicily, including several in the <i>Valley of the Temples</i> at <a>Agrigento</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

Politics on the island became intertwined with those of Greece; <a>Syracuse</a> became desired by the <a>Athenians</a> who set out on the <a>Sicilian Expedition</a> (415–413 BC) during the <a>Peloponnesian War</a>. Syracuse gained <a>Sparta</a> and <a>Corinth</a> as allies and, as a result, defeated the Athenian expedition. The victors destroyed the Athenian army and their ships, selling most of the survivors into <a>slavery</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Taormina_BW_2012-10-05_16-05-05.jpg/220px-Taormina_BW_2012-10-05_16-05-05.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Greek Syracuse controlled eastern Sicily while <a>Carthage</a> controlled the West.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> The two cultures began to clash, leading to the <a>Greek-Punic wars</a> (between 580 and 265 BC). The Greek states had begun to make peace with the <a>Roman Republic</a> in 262 BC,<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and the Romans sought to <a>annex</a> Sicily as their republic's first <a>province</a>. Rome attacked Carthage's holdings in Sicily in the <a>First Punic War</a> (264 to 241 BC) and won, making Sicily the first Roman province outside of the <a>Italian Peninsula</a> by 242 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the <a>Second Punic War</a> (218 to 201 BC), the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Sicily. Some of the Greek cities on the island sided with the Carthaginians. <a>Archimedes</a>, who lived in Syracuse, helped the Carthaginians, Roman troops killed him after they invaded Syracuse in 213 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> The Carthaginian attempt failed, and Rome was even more unrelenting in its annihilation of the invaders this time; <a>Roman consul</a><a>M. Valerian</a>  told the <a>Roman Senate</a> in 210 BC that "no Carthaginian remains in Sicily".<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As the Roman Republic's <a>granary</a>, Sicily ranked as an important province, divided into two <a>quaestor</a> ships: Syracuse to the east and <a>Lilybaeum</a> to the west.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> Some attempt was made<sup>[<i><a><span>by whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> under <a>Augustus</a> (Roman Emperor from 27 BC to 14 AD) to introduce the <a>Latin language</a> to the island, but Sicily was allowed to remain largely Greek in a cultural sense.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> The once prosperous and contented island went into sharp decline when <a>Verres</a> became governor of Sicily (73 to 71 BC). In 70 BC noted figure <a>Cicero</a> condemned the misgovernment of Verres in his oration <i><a>In Verrem</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Various groups used the island as a power base at different times: slave insurgents occupied it during the <a>First</a>  (135−132 BC) and <a>Second</a> (104−100 BC) <a>Servile Wars</a>, and <a>Sextus Pompey</a> had his headquarters there during the <a>Sicilian revolt</a> of 44 to 36 BC. Christianity first appeared in Sicily during the years following AD 200; between this time and AD 313, when Emperor <a>Constantine the Great</a> finally lifted the prohibition on Christianity, a significant number of <a>Sicilians</a> had become <a>martyrs</a>, including <a>Agatha</a>, <a>Christina</a>, <a>Lucy</a>, and <a>Euplius</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> Christianity grew rapidly in Sicily over the next two centuries.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>  Sicily remained a Roman province for around 700 years.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>

The <a>Western Roman Empire</a> began falling apart after the great invasion of <a>Vandals</a>, Alans, and Sueves <a>across the Rhine</a> on the last day of 406. Eventually the Vandals, after roaming about western and southern <a>Hispania</a> (present-day <a>Iberia</a>) for 20 years, moved to North Africa in 429. They occupied Carthage in 439. (The Franks moved south from present-day Belgium. The Visigoths moved west and eventually settled in Aquitaine in 418; the Burgundians settled in present-day Savoy in 443). The Vandals found themselves in a position to threaten Sicily - only 100 miles away from their North African bases.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> After taking Carthage the Vandals, personally led by King <a>Gaiseric</a>, laid siege to Palermo in 440 as the opening act in an attempt to wrest the island from Roman rule.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> The Vandals made another attempt to take the island one year after the 455 sack of Rome, at Agrigento, but were defeated decisively by <a>Ricimir</a> in a <a>naval victory off Corsica</a> in 456.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> The island remained under Roman rule until 469. The Vandals lost possession of the island 8 years later in 477 to the <a>East Germanic tribe</a> of the Ostrogoths, who then controlled Italy and Dalmatia.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> The island was returned<sup>[<i><a><span>to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> for payment of tribute to <a>Odoacer</a>, king of the Ostrogoths. He ruled Italy from 476 to 488 in the name of the <a>Byzantine (Eastern Roman)</a> Emperor. The Vandals kept a toehold in Lilybaeum, a port on the west coast. They lost this in 491 after making one last attempt to conquer the island from this port.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> The <a>Ostrogothic</a> conquest of Sicily (and of Italy as a whole) under <a>Theodoric the Great</a> began in 488. The Byzantine Emperor <a>Zeno</a>  had appointed Theodoric as a military commander in Italy. The Goths were Germanic, but Theodoric fostered Roman culture and government and allowed freedom of religion.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> In 461 from the age of seven or eight until 17 or 18 Theodoric had become a Byzantine hostage; he resided in the great palace of Constantinople, was favored by Emperor <a>Leo I</a> (<span><abbr>r</abbr>. 457–474</span>) and learned to read and write and do arithmetic.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>

After taking areas occupied by the Vandals in North Africa, Justinian decided to retake Italy as an ambitious attempt to recover the lost provinces in the West. The re-conquests marked an end to over 150 years of accommodationist policies with tribal invaders. His first target was Sicily (known as the <a>Gothic War (535–554)</a> began between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the <a>Byzantine Empire</a>). His general <a>Belisarius</a> was assigned the task.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> Sicily was used as a base for the Byzantines to conquer the rest of Italy, with <a>Naples</a>, Rome, <a>Milan</a>. It took five years before the Ostrogoth capital <a>Ravenna</a> fell in 540.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> However, the new Ostrogoth king <a>Totila</a> counterattacked, moving down the Italian peninsula, plundering and conquering Sicily in 550. Totila was defeated and killed in the <a>Battle of Taginae</a> by Byzantine general <a>Narses</a> in 552 but Italy was in ruins.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the time of the reconquest Greek was still the predominant language spoken on the island. Sicily was invaded by the <a>Arab forces</a> of <a>Caliph Uthman</a> in 652, but the Arabs failed to make any permanent gains. They returned to Syria with their booty.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> Raids seeking loot continued until the mid-8th century.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Eastern Roman Emperor <a>Constans II</a> decided to move from <a>Constantinople</a> to <a>Syracuse</a> in 660. The following year he launched an assault from Sicily against the <a>Lombard</a><a>Duchy of Benevento</a> , which occupied most of southern Italy.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> Rumors that the capital of the empire was to be moved to Syracuse probably cost Constans his life, as he was assassinated in 668.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> His son <a>Constantine IV</a> succeeded him. A brief usurpation in Sicily by <a>Mezezius</a> was quickly suppressed by this emperor. Contemporary accounts report that the Greek language was widely spoken on the island during this period.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> In 740 Emperor <a>Leo III the Isaurian</a> transferred Sicily from the jurisdiction of the church of Rome to that of Constantinople, placing the island within the eastern branch of the Church.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 826 <a>Euphemius</a>, the Byzantine commander in Sicily, having apparently killed his wife, forced a nun to marry him. Emperor <a>Michael II</a> caught wind of the matter and ordered general Constantine to end the marriage and cut off Euphemius' head. Euphemius rose up, killed Constantine, and then occupied Syracuse; he, in turn, was defeated and driven out to North Africa.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> He offered the rule of Sicily to <a>Ziyadat Allah</a>, the <a>Aghlabid</a> Emir of <a>Tunisia</a>, in return for a position as a general and a place of safety. A <a>Muslim army</a> was then sent to the island consisting of <a>Arabs</a>, <a>Berbers</a>, <a>Cretans</a>, and <a>Persians</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Muslim conquest of Sicily</a> was a <a>see-saw</a> affair and met with fierce resistance. It took over a century for Byzantine Sicily to be conquered; the largest city, Syracuse, held out until 878 and the Greek city of <a>Taormina</a> fell in 962. It was not until 965 that all of Sicily was conquered by the <a>Arabs</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> In the 11th-century Byzantine armies carried out a partial reconquest of the island under <a>George Maniakes</a>, but it was their <a>Norman</a> mercenaries who would eventually complete the island's reconquest at the end of the century.

The Arabs <a>initiated land reforms</a>, which increased productivity and encouraged the growth of <a>smallholdings</a>, undermining the dominance of the <a>latifundia</a>. The <a>Arabs</a> further improved irrigation systems. The language spoken in Sicily under Arab rule was <a>Siculo-Arabic</a> and <a>Arabic influence</a> is still present in some Sicilian words today.

<p>
A description of <a>Palermo</a> was given by <a>Ibn Hawqal</a>, an <a>Arab merchant</a> who visited Sicily in 950. A walled suburb, called the Al-Kasr (the palace), is the centre of Palermo to this day, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman cathedral. The suburb of al-Khalisa (modern <a>Kalsa</a>) contained the <a>Sultan</a>'s palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. <a>Ibn Hawqal</a> reckoned 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. Palermo was initially ruled by the <a>Aghlabids</a>; later it was the centre of Emirate of Sicily under the nominal suzerainty of the <a>Fatimid Caliphate</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> During the reign of this dynasty revolts by Byzantine Sicilians continuously occurred especially in the east where Greek-speaking Christians predominated. Parts of the island were re-occupied before revolts were being quashed. During Muslim rule agricultural products such as oranges, lemons, <a>pistachio</a> and <a>sugarcane</a> were brought to Sicily.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Under the Arab rule the island was divided in <a>three administrative regions</a>, or "vals", roughly corresponding to the three "points" of Sicily: <a>Val di Mazara</a> in the west; <a>Val Demone</a> in the northeast; and <a>Val di Noto</a> in the southeast. As <a>dhimmis</a>, that is as members of a protected class of approved monotheists the <a>Eastern Orthodox Christians</a> were allowed <a>freedom of religion</a>, but had to pay a tax, the <a>jizya</a> (in lieu of the obligatory alms tax, the zakat, paid by Muslims), and were restricted from active participation in public affairs.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Emirate of Sicily</a> began to fragment as intra-dynastic quarreling fractured the Muslim regime.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> During this time, there was also a small Jewish presence.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>

In 1038, seventy years after losing their last cities in Sicily, the Byzantines under the Greek general <a>George Maniakes</a> invaded the island together with their <a>Varangian</a> and <a>Norman</a> mercenaries. Maniakes was killed in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 before completing a reconquest and the Byzantines withdrew. The Normans invaded in 1061.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> After taking <a>Apulia</a> and <a>Calabria</a>, Roger occupied <a>Messina</a> with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger was victorious at <a>Misilmeri</a>. Most crucial was the siege of Palermo, whose fall in 1071 eventually resulted in all Sicily coming under Norman control.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> The conquest was completed in 1091 when they captured <a>Noto</a> the last Arab stronghold. Palermo continued to be the capital under the <a>Normans</a>.

<p>
The Norman <a>Hauteville family</a>, descendants of <a>Vikings</a>, appreciated and admired the rich and layered culture in which they now found themselves. They also introduced their own culture, customs, and politics in the region. Many Normans in Sicily adopted the habits and comportment of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, even to the extent of having palace <a>eunuchs</a> and, according to some accounts, a harem.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>

Roger died in 1101. His wife <a>Adelaide</a> ruled until 1112 when their son <a>Roger II of Sicily</a> came of age.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> Having succeeded his brother <a>Simon</a> as Count of Sicily, Roger II was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130, along with his other holdings, which included the <a>Maltese Islands</a> and the Duchies of <a>Apulia</a> and <a>Calabria</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Roger II appointed the powerful Greek <a>George of Antioch</a> to be his "emir of emirs" and continued the syncretism of his father. During this period, the Kingdom of Sicily was prosperous and politically powerful, becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of Europe—even wealthier than the <a>Kingdom of England</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic <a>Caliphate of Córdoba</a>, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued in the language of the community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, at the time when the culture was still heavily Arab and Greek.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> Governance was by rule of law which promoted justice. Muslims, Jews, <a>Byzantine Greeks</a>, Lombards, and Normans worked together fairly amicably. During this time many extraordinary buildings were constructed.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

However this situation changed as the Normans to secure the island imported immigrants from <a>Normandy</a>, <a>England</a>, Lombardy, Piedmont, Provence and <a>Campania</a>. Linguistically, the island shifted from being one-third Greek- and two-thirds Arabic-speaking at the time of the Norman conquest to becoming fully <a>Latinised</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> In terms of religion the island became completely Roman Catholic (bearing in mind that until 1054 the Churches owing allegiance to the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople belonged to one Church); Sicily before the Norman conquest was under Eastern Orthodox Patriarch.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> After Pope Innocent III made him Papal Legate in 1098, Roger I created several Catholic bishoprics while still allowing the construction of 12 Greek-speaking monasteries (the Greek language, monasteries, and 1500 parishes continued to exist until the adherents of the Greek Rite were forced in 1585 to convert to Catholicism or leave; a small pocket of Greek-speakers still live in Messina).

<p>
After a century, the Norman <a>Hauteville</a> dynasty died out; the last direct descendant and heir of Roger, <a>Constance</a>, married <a>Emperor Henry VI</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> This eventually led to the crown of Sicily being passed on to the <a>Hohenstaufen Dynasty</a>, who were Germans from <a>Swabia</a>. The last of the Hohenstaufens, <a>Frederick II</a>, the only son of <a>Constance</a>, was one of the greatest and most cultured men of the Middle Ages. His mother's will had asked <a>Pope Innocent III</a> to undertake the guardianship of her son.  Frederick was four when at <a>Palermo</a>, he was crowned <a>King of Sicily</a> in 1198. Frederick received no systematic education and was allowed to run free in the streets of <a>Palermo</a>. There he picked up the many languages he heard spoken, such as Arabic and Greek, and learned some of the lore of the Jewish community. At age twelve, he dismissed Innocent's deputy regent and took over the government; at fifteen he married <a>Constance of Aragon</a>, and began his reclamation of the imperial crown. Subsequently, due to Muslim rebellions, Frederick II destroyed the remaining Muslim presence in Sicily, estimated at 60,000 persons, moving all to the city of Lucera in Apulia between 1221 and 1226.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the <a>Papacy</a> led, in 1266, to <a>Pope Innocent IV</a> crowning the <a>French prince</a><a>Charles</a> , <a>count of Anjou</a> and <a>Provence</a>, as the king of both Sicily and Naples.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>

<p>
Strong opposition to French officialdom due to mistreatment and taxation saw the local peoples of Sicily rise up, leading in 1282 to an <a>insurrection</a> known as the <a>War of the Sicilian Vespers</a>, which eventually saw almost the entire French population on the island killed.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> During the war, the Sicilians turned to <a>Peter III of Aragon</a>, son-in-law of the last Hohenstaufen king, for support after being rejected by the Pope. Peter gained control of Sicily from the French, who, however, retained control of the <a>Kingdom of Naples</a>. A crusade was launched in August 1283 against Peter III and the Kingdom of Aragon by <a>Pope Martin IV</a> (a pope from <a>Île-de-France</a>), but it failed. The wars continued until the <a>peace of Caltabellotta</a> in 1302, which saw Peter's son <a>Frederick III</a> recognized as the king of the Isle of Sicily, while <a>Charles II</a> was recognized as the king of Naples by <a>Pope Boniface VIII</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> Sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives of the kings of Aragon until 1409 and then as part of the <a>Crown of Aragon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> In October 1347, in Messina, Sicily, the <a>Black Death</a> first arrived in Europe.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup>

<p>
Between the 15th-18th centuries, waves of <a>Greeks</a> from the <a>Peloponnese</a> (such as the <a>Maniots</a>) and <a>Arvanites</a> migrated to Sicily in large numbers to escape persecution after the <a>Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese</a>. They brought with them <a>Eastern Orthodoxy</a> as well as the <a>Greek</a> and <a>Arvanitika</a> languages to the island, once again adding onto the extensive <a>Byzantine</a>/<a>Greek</a> influence.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
The onset of the <a>Spanish Inquisition</a> in 1492 led to <a>Ferdinand II</a> decreeing the expulsion of all Jews from Sicily.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> The eastern part of the island was hit by very destructive earthquakes in 1542 and 1693. Just a few years before the latter earthquake, the island was struck by a ferocious <a>plague</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> The <a>earthquake in 1693</a> took an estimated 60,000 lives.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> There were revolts during the 17th century, but these were quelled with significant force, especially the revolts of Palermo and Messina.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><a>North African</a><a>slave raids</a>   discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> The <a>Treaty of Utrecht</a> in 1713 saw Sicily assigned to the <a>House of Savoy</a>; however, this period of rule lasted only seven years, as it was exchanged for the island of <a>Sardinia</a> with <a>Emperor Charles VI</a> of the Austrian <a>Habsburg Dynasty</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
While the Austrians were concerned with the <a>War of the Polish Succession</a>, a <a>Bourbon</a> prince, <a>Charles</a> from Spain was able to conquer Sicily and Naples.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> At first Sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under <a>personal union</a>, while the Bourbons ruled over both from Naples. However, the advent of <a>Napoleon</a>'s <a>First French Empire</a> saw Naples taken at the <a>Battle of Campo Tenese</a> and Bonapartist <a>King of Naples</a> were installed. <a>Ferdinand III</a> the Bourbon was forced to retreat to Sicily which he was still in complete control of with the help of <a>British naval</a> protection.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Following this, Sicily joined the <a>Napoleonic Wars</a>, and subsequently the British under <a>Lord William Bentinck</a> established a military and diplomatic presence on the island to protect against a French invasion. After the wars were won, Sicily and Naples formally merged as the <a>Two Sicilies</a> under the Bourbons. Major <a>revolutionary</a> movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the <a>1848 revolution</a> resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook control of the island and dominated it until 1860.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>

The <a>Expedition of the Thousand</a> led by <a>Giuseppe Garibaldi</a> captured Sicily in 1860, as part of the <i><a>Risorgimento</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> The conquest started at <a>Marsala</a>, and native Sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern Italian peninsula. Garibaldi's march was completed with the <a>Siege of Gaeta</a>, where the final <a>Bourbons</a> were expelled and Garibaldi announced his dictatorship in the name of <a>Victor Emmanuel II</a> of <a>Kingdom of Sardinia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum where more than 75% of Sicily voted in favour of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (but not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the <a>proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy</a>, Sicily became part of the kingdom on 17 March 1861.

</p>
<p>
The Sicilian economy (and the wider <i><a>mezzogiorno</a></i> economy) remained relatively underdeveloped after the <a>Italian unification</a>, in spite of the strong investments made by the <a>Kingdom of Italy</a> in terms of modern infrastructure, and this caused an unprecedented <a>wave of emigration</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> In 1894, organisations of workers and peasants known as the <i><a>Fasci Siciliani</a></i> protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island, but they were suppressed in a few days.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> The <a>Messina earthquake</a> of 28 December 1908 killed more than 80,000 people.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
This period was also characterized by the first contact between the <a>Sicilian mafia</a> (the crime syndicate also known as Cosa Nostra) and the Italian government. The Mafia's origins are still uncertain, but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th century initially in the role of private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of <a>bandits</a> (<i>Briganti</i>) who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns. The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The <a>Carabinieri</a> (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the <a>Italian army</a> were often involved in terrible fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret co-operation between the mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup>

<p>
In the 1920s, the <a>Fascist</a> regime began a stronger military action against the Mafia, which was led by <a>prefect</a><a>Cesare Mori</a> , who was known as the "Iron Prefect" because of his iron-fisted campaigns. This was the first time in which an operation against the Sicilian mafia ended with considerable success.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> There was an <a>Allied invasion of Sicily</a> during World War II starting on 10 July 1943. In preparation for the invasion, the Allies <a>revitalised</a> the Mafia to aid them. The invasion of Sicily contributed to the <a>25 July crisis</a>; in general, the Allied victors were warmly embraced by Sicily.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>
</p>

Italy <a>became a Republic</a> in 1946 and, as part of the <a>Constitution of Italy</a>, Sicily was one of the five <a>regions</a> given special status as an <a>autonomous region</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> Both the partial Italian <a>land reform</a> and special funding from the Italian government's <i><a>Cassa per il Mezzogiorno</a></i> (Fund for the South) from 1950 to 1984 helped the Sicilian economy. During this period, the economic and social condition of the island was generally improved thanks to important investments on infrastructures such as <a>motorways</a> and <a>airports</a>, and thanks to the creation of important industrial and commercial areas.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> In the 1980s, the Mafia was deeply weakened by a second important campaign led by magistrates <a>Giovanni Falcone</a> and <a>Paolo Borsellino</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> Between 1990 and 2005, the <a>unemployment rate</a> fell from about 23% to 11%.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Sicily, especially around Palermo.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> A police investigation in summer 2019 also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area <a>Sicilian Mafia</a> and American organized crime, particularly the <a>Gambino crime family</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> According to <i><a>La Repubblica</a></i>, "Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned".<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>

<p>
About five million people live in Sicily, making it the <a>fourth most populated region in Italy</a>. In the first century after the <a>Italian unification</a>, Sicily had one of the most negative <a>net migration rates</a> among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to Northern Italy, other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to <a>Northern Italy</a> instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. According to <a>ISTAT</a> figures from 2017,<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total 5,029,615 population;<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup><a>Romanians</a>  with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by <a>Tunisians</a>, <a>Moroccans</a>, <a>Sri Lankans</a>, <a>Albanians</a>, and others mostly from Eastern Europe.<sup>[<i><a><span>failed verification</span></a></i>]</sup> As in the rest of Italy, the official language is Italian and the primary religion is <a>Roman Catholicism</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup>

<p>
Italian emigration started shortly after the <a>Italian unification</a> and has not stopped ever since.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
After the <a>Italian unification</a>, Sicily, along with the entire Italian peninsula, has also been strongly marked by <a>coerced emigration</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Most of the assets of the <a>Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a>'s former national bank, <i><a>Banco delle Due Sicilie</a></i>, were transferred to Piedmont.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> During the first decades of Risorgimento, a rising number of southern Italian manufactories were driven into ruin due to high taxation imposed by the central government.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Furthermore, an embargo<sup>[<i><a><span>which?</span></a></i>]</sup> imposed on goods coming from southern Italian manufacturers, that effectively barred them from exporting to the north and abroad, were also key factors that led to further impoverishment of the entire region.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The aforementioned factors, along with a failed land reform, resulted in a never-before-seen wave of Sicilians emigrating, first to the <a>United States</a> between the 1880s and the 1920s, later to Northern Italy, and from the 1960s onwards also to <a>Belgium</a>, <a>France</a>, <a>Germany</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>, as well as <a>Australia</a> and <a>South America</a>.

</p>
<p>
Today, Sicily is the Italian region with the highest number of <a>expatriates</a>:  as of 2017, 750,000 Sicilians, 14.4% of the island's population, lived abroad.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>  For lack of employment, every year many Sicilians, especially young graduates, still leave the island to seek jobs abroad.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> Today, an estimated 10 million people of Sicilian origins live around the world.

<p>
As in most Italian regions, <a>Roman Catholicism</a> is the predominant religious denomination in Sicily, and the church still plays an important role in the lives of most people. There is also a notable small minority of Eastern-rite <a>Byzantine Catholics</a> which has a mixed congregation of ethnic <a>Albanians</a>; it is operated by the <a>Italo-Albanian Catholic Church</a>. Most people still attend church weekly or at least for religious festivals, and many people get married in churches. There was a wide presence of Jews in Sicily for at least 1,400 years and possibly for more than 2,000 years. Some scholars believe that the Sicilian Jewry are partial ancestors of the <a>Ashkenazi Jews</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup> However, much of the Jewish community faded away when they were <a>expelled from the island</a> in 1492. <a>Islam</a> was present during the <a>Emirate of Sicily</a>, although Muslims were also expelled. Today, mostly due to immigration to the island, there are also several religious minorities, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, <a>Hinduism</a>, Islam, Judaism, and <a>Sikhism</a>. There are also a fair number of <a>evangelical</a> Christians who live on the island.

<h2 id="Politics">Politics</h2>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Sicily">Politics of Sicily</a></div>
<p>
The politics of Sicily takes place in a framework of a <a>presidential</a><a>representative democracy</a> , whereby the President of Regional Government is the <a>head of government</a>, and of a pluriform <a>multi-party system</a>. <a>Executive power</a> is exercised by the Regional Government. <a>Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and the <a>Sicilian Regional Assembly</a>. The capital of Sicily is <a>Palermo</a>.

</p>
<p>
Traditionally, Sicily votes for centre-right parties during elections.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup> From 1943-51, there was also a <a>separatist</a> political party called <a>Sicilian Independence Movement</a> (<i>Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano</i>, MIS). Their most successful result was at the <a>1946 general election</a>, when MIS obtained 0.7% of national votes (8.8% of votes in Sicily), and four seats. However, the movement lost all their seats following the <a>1948 general election</a> and the 1951 regional election. Even though it has never been formally disbanded, today the movement is no longer part of the <a>politics of Sicily</a>. After <a>World War II</a>, Sicily became a stronghold of the <a>Christian Democracy</a>, in opposition to the <a>Italian Communist Party</a>. The <a>Communists</a> and their successors (the <a>Democratic Party of the Left</a>, the <a>Democrats of the Left</a> and the present-day <a>Democratic Party</a>) had never won any seats in the region until <a>2012</a>. Sicily is now governed by a centre-right coalition. <a>Nello Musumeci</a> is the current President and has served since 2017.

<p>
Administratively, Sicily is divided into nine provinces, each with a capital city of the same name as the province. Small surrounding islands are also part of various Sicilian provinces: the <a>Aeolian Islands</a> (Messina), isle of <a>Ustica</a> (Palermo), <a>Aegadian Islands</a> (Trapani), isle of <a>Pantelleria</a> (Trapani) and <a>Pelagian Islands</a> (Agrigento).

<p>
Thanks to the regular growth of the last years, Sicily is the eighth largest regional economy of Italy in terms of total GDP (see <a>List of Italian regions by GDP</a>). A series of reforms and investments on agriculture such as the introduction of modern irrigation systems have made this important industry competitive.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> In the 1970s there was a growth of the <a>industrial sector</a> through the creation of some factories.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> In recent years the importance of the <a>service industry</a> has grown for the opening of several shopping malls and for modest growth of financial and telecommunication activities.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> Tourism is an important source of wealth for the island thanks to its natural and historical heritage. Today Sicily is investing a large amount of money on structures of the <a>hospitality industry</a>, in order to make tourism more competitive.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> However, Sicily continues to have a GDP per capita below the Italian average and higher unemployment than the rest of Italy.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup> This difference is mostly caused by the negative influence of the Mafia that is still active in some areas although it is much weaker than in the past.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup>

<p>
Sicily has long been noted for its fertile soil due to volcanic eruptions. The local agriculture is also helped by the pleasant climate of the island. The main agricultural products are wheat, <a>citrons</a>, oranges <i>(<a>Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP</a>)</i>, lemons, tomatoes <i>(<a>Pomodoro di Pachino IGP</a>)</i>, <a>olives</a>, <a>olive oil</a>, <a>artichokes</a>, <a>prickly pear</a><i>(Fico d'India dell'<a>Etna</a> DOP)</i> , <a>almonds</a>, <a>grapes</a>, <a>pistachios</a><i>(Pistacchio di <a>Bronte</a> DOP)</i>  and wine. Cattle and sheep are raised. The cheese productions are particularly important thanks to the <a>Ragusano DOP</a> and the <a>Pecorino Siciliano DOP</a>. <a>Ragusa</a> is noted for its <a>honey</a> (<i>Miele Ibleo</i>) and chocolate (<i><a>Cioccolato di Modica</a> IGP</i>) productions.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup>

<p>
Sicily is the third largest wine producer in Italy (the world's largest wine producer) after <a>Veneto</a> and <a>Emilia Romagna</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup> The region is known mainly for fortified <a>Marsala wines</a>. In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-known native varieties, and Sicilian wines have become better known.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup> The best known local variety is <a>Nero d'Avola</a>, named for a small town not far from <a>Syracuse</a>; the best wines made with these grapes come from <a>Noto</a>, a famous old city close to Avola. Other important native varieties are <a>Nerello Mascalese</a> used to make the <a>Etna Rosso DOC wine</a>, <a>Frappato</a> that is a component of the <a>Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine</a>, <a>Moscato di Pantelleria</a> (also known as <i>Zibibbo</i>) used to make different <a>Pantelleria</a> wines, <a>Malvasia di Lipari</a> used for the <a>Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine</a> and <a>Catarratto</a> mostly used to make the white wine <a>Alcamo DOC</a>. Furthermore, in Sicily high quality wines are also produced using non-native varieties like <a>Syrah</a>, <a>Chardonnay</a> and <a>Merlot</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Sicily is also known for its liqueurs, such as the <a>Amaro Averna</a> produced in <a>Caltanissetta</a> and the local <a>limoncello</a>.

</p>
<p>
Fishing is another fundamental resource for Sicily. There are important <a>tuna</a>, <a>sardine</a>, <a>swordfish</a> and <a>European anchovy</a> fisheries. <a>Mazara del Vallo</a> is the largest fishing centre in Sicily and one of the most important in Italy.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup>

Highways have been built and expanded in the last four decades. The most prominent Sicilian roads are the motorways (known as <i>autostrade</i>) in the north of the island.

The first railway in Sicily was opened in 1863 (Palermo-Bagheria) and today all of the Sicilian provinces are served by a network of railway services, linking to most major cities and towns; this service is operated by <a>Trenitalia</a>. Of the 1,378 km (856 mi) of railway tracks in use, over 60% has been <a>electrified</a> whilst the remaining 583 km (362 mi) are serviced by <a>diesel</a> engines. 88% of the lines (1.209 km) are single-track and only 169 km (105 mi) are double-track serving the two main routes, Messina-Palermo (<a>Tyrrhenian</a>) and Messina-Catania-Syracuse (<a>Ionian</a>), which are the main lines of this region. Of the <a>narrow-gauge railways</a> the <a>Ferrovia Circumetnea</a> is the only one that still operates, going round <a>Mount Etna</a>. From the major cities of Sicily, there are services to <a>Naples</a>, <a>Rome</a> and <a>Milan</a>; this is achieved by the trains being loaded onto <a>ferries</a> which cross the Strait.<sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup>

<p>
Plans for a bridge linking Sicily to the mainland have been discussed since 1865. Throughout the last decade, plans were developed for a road and rail link to the mainland via what would be the world's longest <a>suspension bridge</a>, the <a>Strait of Messina Bridge</a>. Planning for the project has experienced several false starts over the past few years. On 6 March 2009, <a>Silvio Berlusconi</a>'s government declared that the construction works for the Messina Bridge will begin on 23 December 2009, and announced a pledge of €1.3 billion as a contribution to the bridge's total cost, estimated at €6.1 billion.<sup><a href="#ref_133">[133]</a></sup>
The plan has been criticized by environmental associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economical sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organized crime.<sup><a href="#ref_134">[134]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup>

Sicily's sunny, dry climate, scenery, cuisine, history, and architecture attract many tourists from mainland Italy and abroad. The tourist season peaks in the summer months, although people visit the island all year round. <a>Mount Etna</a>, the beaches, the archaeological sites, and major cities such as <a>Palermo</a>, <a>Catania</a>, <a>Syracuse</a> and <a>Ragusa</a> are the favourite tourist destinations, but the old town of <a>Taormina</a> and the neighbouring seaside resort of <a>Giardini Naxos</a> draw visitors from all over the world, as do the <a>Aeolian Islands</a>, <a>Erice</a>, <a>Castellammare del Golfo</a>, <a>Cefalù</a>, <a>Agrigento</a>, the <a>Pelagie Islands</a> and <a>Capo d'Orlando</a>. The last features some of the best-preserved temples of the ancient Greek period. Many Mediterranean cruise ships stop in Sicily, and many wine tourists also visit the island.

<h3 id="Coastal_towers">Coastal towers</h3>
<p>
The <a>Coastal towers in Sicily</a> (<i>Torri costiere della Sicilia</i>) are 218 old <a>watchtowers</a> along the coast. In Sicily, the first coastal towers date back to 1313 and 1345 of the Aragonese monarchy. From 1360 the threat came from the south, from <a>North Africa</a> to <a>Maghreb</a>, mainly to <a>Barbary pirates</a> and corsairs of <a>Barbary Coast</a>. In 1516, the Turks settled in <a>Algiers</a>, and from 1520, the corsair <a>Hayreddin Barbarossa</a> under the command of <a>Ottoman Empire</a>, operated from that harbor.

</p>
<p>
Most existing towers were built on architectural designs of the Florentine architect <a>Camillo Camilliani</a> from [1583] to 1584 and involved the coastal periple of Sicily. The typology changed completely in '800, because of the new higher fire volumes of cannon vessels, the towers were built on the type of <a>Martello towers</a> that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire. 
The decline of Mediterranean piracy caused by the <a>Second Barbary War</a> led to a smaller number of coastal towers built during the 19th Century.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup>

Sicily has long been associated with <a>the arts</a>; many poets, writers, <a>philosophers</a>, intellectuals, architects and painters have roots on the island.

<a>Terracotta</a><a>ceramics</a>  from the island are well known, the art of ceramics on Sicily goes back to the original ancient peoples named the <a>Sicanians</a>, it was then perfected during the period of Greek colonisation and is still prominent and distinct to this day.<sup><a href="#ref_152">[152]</a></sup> Nowadays, <a>Caltagirone</a> is one of the most important centres in Sicily for the artistic production of ceramics and terra-cotta sculptures. Famous painters include <a>Renaissance</a> artist <a>Antonello da Messina</a>, <a>Bruno Caruso</a>, <a>Renato Guttuso</a> and Greek born <a>Giorgio de Chirico</a> who is commonly dubbed the "father of <a>Surrealist art</a>" and founder of the <a>metaphysical art</a> movement.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup> The most noted architects are <a>Filippo Juvarra</a> (one of the most important figures of the Italian <a>Baroque</a>) and <a>Ernesto Basile</a>.

<p>
The <a>Sicilian Baroque</a> has a unique architectural identity. <a>Noto</a>, <a>Caltagirone</a>, <a>Catania</a>, <a>Ragusa</a>, <a>Modica</a>, <a>Scicli</a> and particularly <a>Acireale</a> contain some of Italy's best examples of <a>Baroque architecture</a>, carved in the local red <a>sandstone</a>. Noto provides one of the best examples of the Baroque architecture brought to Sicily.
The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and <a>palazzi</a> built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy.<sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup> The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, <a>Florence</a>, and <a>Naples</a>. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily's older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily's Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it typically included at least two or three of the following features, coupled with a unique freedom of design that is more difficult to characterize in words.

The golden age of Sicilian poetry began in the early 13th century with the <a>Sicilian School</a> of <a>Giacomo da Lentini</a>, which was highly influential on <a>Italian literature</a>. Some of the most noted figures among writers and poets are <a>Luigi Pirandello</a> (<a>Nobel laureate, 1934</a>), <a>Salvatore Quasimodo</a> (<a>Nobel laureate, 1959</a>), <a>Giovanni Verga</a> (the father of the <i>Italian <a>Verismo</a></i>), <a>Domenico Tempio</a>, <a>Giovanni Meli</a>, <a>Luigi Capuana</a>, <a>Mario Rapisardi</a>, <a>Federico de Roberto</a>, <a>Leonardo Sciascia</a>, <a>Vitaliano Brancati</a>, <a>Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa</a>, <a>Elio Vittorini</a>, <a>Vincenzo Consolo</a> and <a>Andrea Camilleri</a> (noted for his novels and short stories with the fictional character <a>Inspector Salvo Montalbano</a> as protagonist). On the political side notable philosophers include <a>Gaetano Mosca</a> and <a>Giovanni Gentile</a> who wrote <i><a>The Doctrine of Fascism</a></i>. In terms of academic reflection, the historical and aesthetic richness as well as the multi-layered heterogeneity of Sicilian literature and culture have been first grasped methodologically and coined with the term of <a>transculturality</a> by <a>German</a> scholar of <a>Italian studies</a><a>Dagmar Reichardt</a>  who, after having published an extensive study on the literary work of <a>Giuseppe Bonaviri</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup> was awarded the International <a>Premio Flaiano</a> ("Italianistica") for a trilingual (English, Italian, German) collection about the <a>European</a><a>liminality</a>  of Sicily, Sicilian literature and Sicilian Studies.<sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup>

Today in Sicily most people are bilingual and speak both Italian and <a>Sicilian</a>, a distinct and historical <a>Romance language</a>. Some of the <a>Sicilian</a> words are <a>loan words</a> from <a>Greek</a>, <a>Catalan</a>, French, <a>Arabic</a>, Spanish and other languages.<sup><a href="#ref_158">[158]</a></sup> Dialects related to Sicilian are also spoken in <a>Calabria</a> and <a>Salento</a>; it had a significant influence on the <a>Maltese language</a>. However the use of <a>Sicilian</a> is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family) and in a majority of cases it is replaced by the so-called <i>regional Italian of Sicily</i>, an <a>Italian dialect</a> that is a kind of mix between Italian and Sicilian.<sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Sicilian was an early influence in the development of the first Italian standard, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of <a>Frederick II</a> and his court of notaries, or <i>Magna Curia</i>, which, headed by <a>Giacomo da Lentini</a>, also gave birth to the <a>Sicilian School</a>, widely inspired by troubadour literature. Its linguistic and poetic heritage was later assimilated into the Florentine by <a>Dante Alighieri</a>, the father of modern Italian who, in his <i><a>De vulgari eloquentia</a></i>, claims that "In effect, this vernacular seems to deserve higher praise than the others since all the poetry written by Italians can be called Sicilian".<sup><a href="#ref_160">[160]</a></sup> It is in this language that appeared the first <a>sonnet</a>, whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself.

<p>
The island has a long history of producing a variety of noted cuisines and wines, to the extent that Sicily is sometimes nicknamed <i>God's Kitchen</i> because of this.<sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> Every part of Sicily has its speciality (e.g. Cassata is typical of Palermo although available everywhere in Sicily, as is Granita). The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public.<sup><a href="#ref_171">[171]</a></sup> The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to be <a>healthy</a>, using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, <a>artichokes</a>, <a>olives</a> (including <a>olive oil</a>), <a>citrus</a>, <a>apricots</a>, <a>aubergines</a>, onions, <a>beans</a>, <a>raisins</a> commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including <a>tuna</a>, <a>sea bream</a>, <a>sea bass</a>, <a>cuttlefish</a>, <a>swordfish</a>, <a>sardines</a>, and others.<sup><a href="#ref_172">[172]</a></sup>

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Arancini_002.jpg/220px-Arancini_002.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The most well-known part of Sicilian cuisine is the rich sweet dishes including <a>ice creams</a> and <a>pastries</a>. <a>Cannoli</a> (singular: <i>cannolo</i>), a tube-shaped shell of fried pastry dough filled with a sweet filling usually containing <a>ricotta</a>, is strongly associated with Sicily worldwide.<sup><a href="#ref_173">[173]</a></sup> Biancomangiare, biscotti ennesi (cookies native to <a>Enna</a>), braccilatte (a Sicilian version of <a>doughnuts</a>), <a>buccellato</a>, <a>ciarduna</a>, <a>pignoli</a>, <a>Biscotti Regina</a>, <a>giurgiulena</a>, <a>frutta martorana</a>, <a>cassata</a>, <a>pignolata</a>, <a>granita</a>, <a>cuccidati</a> (a variety of fig cookie; also known as buccellati) and <a>cuccìa</a> are some notable sweet dishes.<sup><a href="#ref_173">[173]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Like the cuisine of the rest of southern Italy, pasta plays an important part in Sicilian cuisine, as does rice; for example with <a>arancini</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup> As well as using some other cheeses, Sicily has spawned some of its own, using both cow's and sheep's milk, such as <a>pecorino</a> and <a>caciocavallo</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_175">[175]</a></sup> Spices used include <a>saffron</a>, <a>nutmeg</a>, <a>clove</a>, <a>pepper</a>, and <a>cinnamon</a>, which were introduced by the Arabs. <a>Parsley</a> is used abundantly in many dishes. Although Sicilian cuisine is commonly associated with sea food, meat dishes, including <a>goose</a>, <a>lamb</a>, goat, rabbit, and <a>turkey</a>, are also found in Sicily. It was the <a>Normans</a> and <a>Swabians</a> who first introduced a fondness for meat dishes to the island.<sup><a href="#ref_176">[176]</a></sup> Some varieties of wine are produced from vines that are relatively unique to the island, such as the <a>Nero d'Avola</a> made near the baroque of town of <a>Noto</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_177">[177]</a></sup>

<p>
The most popular sport in Sicily is <a>football</a>, which came to the fore in the late 19th century under the influence of the English. Some of the oldest football clubs in Italy are from Sicily: the three most successful are <a>Palermo</a>, <a>Catania</a>, and <a>Messina</a>, which have played 29, 17 and 5 seasons in the <a>Serie A</a> respectively. No club from Sicily has ever won Serie A, but football is still deeply embedded in local culture and all over Sicily most towns have a representative team.<sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Palermo and Catania have a heated rivalry and compete in the <a>Sicilian derby</a> together. Palermo is the only team in Sicily to have played on the European stage, in the <a>UEFA Cup</a>. In the island, the most noted footballer is <a>Salvatore Schillaci</a>, who won the <a>Golden Boot</a> at the <a>1990 FIFA World Cup</a> with <a>Italy</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup> Other noted players include <a>Giuseppe Furino</a>, <a>Pietro Anastasi</a>, <a>Francesco Coco</a>, <a>Christian Riganò</a>, and <a>Roberto Galia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup> There have also been some noted managers from the island, such as <a>Carmelo Di Bella</a> and <a>Franco Scoglio</a>.

</p>
<p>
Although football is the most popular sport in Sicily, the island also has participants in other fields. <a>Amatori Catania</a> have competed in the top Italian national <a>rugby union</a> league called <a>National Championship of Excellence</a>. They have even participated at the European level in the <a>European Challenge Cup</a>. Competing in the basketball variation of <a>Serie A</a> is <a>Orlandina Basket</a> from <a>Capo d'Orlando</a> in the <a>province of Messina</a>, where the sport has a reasonable following. Various other sports that are played to some extent include volleyball, <a>handball</a>, and <a>water polo</a>. Previously, in <a>motorsport</a>, Sicily held the prominent <a>Targa Florio</a> sports car race that took place in the Madonie Mountains, with the start-finish line in <a>Cerda</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup> The event was started in 1906 by Sicilian industrialist and automobile enthusiast <a>Vincenzo Florio</a>, and ran until it was canceled due to safety concerns in 1977.<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup>

Each town and city has its own patron saint, and the <a>feast days</a> are marked by colourful processions through the streets with marching bands and displays of fireworks.

</p>
<p>
Sicilian religious festivals also include the <i>presepe vivente</i> (living <a>nativity scene</a>), which takes place at Christmas time. Deftly combining religion and folklore, it is a constructed mock 19th-century Sicilian village, complete with a nativity scene, and has people of all ages dressed in the costumes of the period, some impersonating the Holy Family, and others working as artisans of their particular assigned trade. It is normally concluded on <a>Epiphany</a>, often highlighted by the arrival of the <a>magi</a> on horseback.

</p>
<p>
Oral tradition plays a large role in Sicilian folklore. Many stories passed down from generation to generation involve a character named "<a>Giufà</a>". Anecdotes from this character's life preserve Sicilian culture as well as convey moral messages.

</p>
<p>
Sicilians also enjoy outdoor festivals, held in the local square or <i>piazza</i> where live music and dancing are performed on stage, and food fairs or <i>sagre</i> are set up in booths lining the square. These offer various local specialties, as well as typical Sicilian food. Normally these events are concluded with fireworks. A noted <i>sagra</i> is the <i>Sagra del Carciofo</i> or <i><a>Artichoke</a> Festival</i>, which is held annually in <a>Ramacca</a> in April. The most important traditional event in Sicily is the <a>carnival</a>. Famous carnivals are in <a>Acireale</a>, <a>Misterbianco</a>, <a>Regalbuto</a>, <a>Paternò</a>, <a>Sciacca</a>, <a>Termini Imerese</a>.

<p>
The <b><a>Opera dei Pupi</a></b> (Opera of the Puppets; <a>Sicilian</a>: Òpira dî pupi) is a <a>marionette</a> theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems such as the <a>Song of Roland</a> or <i><a>Orlando furioso</a></i> that is one of the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional <a>puppet theatres</a> featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of <i>cantastorî</i> (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal <a>troubadour</a> tradition in Sicily during the reign of <a>Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of <a>Palermo</a>. The Sicilian marionette theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the <a>UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_180">[180]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionettists, such as the Greco of <a>Palermo</a>; the <a>Canino</a> of <a>Partinico</a> and <a>Alcamo</a>; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of <a>Catania</a>, Pennisi and Macri of <a>Acireale</a>, Profeta of <a>Licata</a>, Gargano and Grasso of <a>Agrigento</a>. One can, however, admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino and at the <a>Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè</a> in Palermo. Other elaborate marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in <a>Randazzo</a>.

The <a>Sicilian cart</a> is an ornate, colourful style of a horse or donkey-drawn cart native to Sicily. Sicilian wood carver <a>George Petralia</a> states that horses were mostly used in the city and flat plains, while donkeys or mules were more often used in rough terrain for hauling heavy loads.<sup><a href="#ref_181">[181]</a></sup> The cart has two wheels and is primarily handmade out of wood with iron components.

<p>
The Sicilian <a>coppola</a> is a traditional kind of <a>flat cap</a> typically worn by men in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the <i>tascu</i> began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a <a>driving cap</a>, usually worn by car drivers. The <i>coppola</i> is usually made in <a>tweed</a>. Today it is widely regarded as a definitive symbol of Sicilian heritage.<sup><a href="#ref_182">[182]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Flag of Sicily</a>, regarded as a regional icon, was first adopted in 1282, after the <a>Sicilian Vespers</a> of <a>Palermo</a>. It is characterised by the presence of the <a>triskeles</a> in the middle, depicting the head of <a>Medusa</a> and three wheat ears representing the extreme fertility of the land of Sicily.<sup><a href="#ref_183">[183]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>additional citation(s) needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In early mythology, when Medusa was slain and beheaded by Perseus, the Medusa head was placed in the centre of Athena's shield.<sup><a href="#ref_184">[184]</a></sup> Palermo and Corleone were the first two cities to found a confederation against the <a>Angevin</a> rule. The triskeles symbol came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during <a>World War II</a> when <a>Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile</a> led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The colours, likewise introduced in the 1940s, respectively represent the cities of <a>Palermo</a> and <a>Corleone</a>. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the center of it. When <a>World War II</a> ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic.

</p>
<p>
The flag became the official public flag of the <i>Regione Siciliana</i> in January 2000, after the passing of an apposite regional law which advocates its use on public buildings, schools and city halls along with the national <a>Italian flag</a> and the <a>European</a> one.

</p>
<p>
Familiar as an ancient symbol of the region, the <a>Triskelion</a> is also featured on Greek coins of <a>Syracuse</a>, such as coins of <a>Agathocles</a> (317–289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of <a>Magna Graecia</a>, the colonial extension of <a>Greece</a> beyond the <a>Aegean</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_185">[185]</a></sup> The triskelion was revived, as a <a>neoclassic</a> – and non-<a>Bourbon</a> – emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the <a>Two Sicilies</a>, by <a>Joachim Murat</a> in 1808. In the case of Sicily, the triskelion symbol is said to represent the three <a>capes</a> (<a>headlands</a> or <a>promontories</a> of the island of Sicily, namely: <a>Pelorus</a> (Peloro, Tip of Faro, Messina: North-East); <a>Pachynus</a> (Passero, Syracuse: South); and <a>Lilybæum</a> (Lilibeo, Cape Boeo, Marsala: West), which form three points of a triangle.<sup><a href="#ref_183">[183]</a></sup>

"Palazzo" <i>(pl. palazzi)</i>: is any large building in a town, state or private (often much smaller than the term <i>palace</i> implies in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world">English-speaking world</a>). While <i>palazzo</i> is the technically correct appellation and postal address, no Sicilian aristocrat would ever use the word, instead referring to his or her own house, however large, as "casa". "Palazzo" followed by the family name was the term used by officials, tradesmen, and delivery men. Gefen, p. 15.
