<h3 id="Early_history">Early history</h3>
<p>
Present day Falcón State was first explored in 1499 by <a>Juan de la Cosa</a> and <a>Américo Vespucio</a>, as part of an expedition supervised by <a>Alonso de Ojeda</a>. In 1527, the city of Coro was founded by <a>Juan Ampíes</a>, who named it "<a>Santa Ana de Coro</a>". 
In 1811, when <a>Venezuela</a> declared its independence from Spain, Coro remained faithful to the <a>Spanish Crown</a> and was merged with the <a>Province of Maracaibo</a>.  In 1815, King  <a>Fernando VII</a> created the <a>Province of Coro</a>. In 1821, the province was liberated from Spain by <a>Josefa Camejo</a> during the <a>Venezuelan War of Independence</a>  The area then became a province of the department of <a>Zulia</a> of the Republic of <a>Gran Colombia</a>.  In 1830, with the separation of Venezuela from <a>Gran Colombia</a>,  the Falcón area became a separate province of that nation.  

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Casco_Central_Santa_Ana_de_Coro%2C_estado_Falcon%2C_Venezuela.jpg/220px-Casco_Central_Santa_Ana_de_Coro%2C_estado_Falcon%2C_Venezuela.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
By 1856, the province contained the cantons of <a>Coro</a>, San Luis, <a>Casigua</a>, Costa Arriba, <a>Cumarebo</a> and the <a>Paraguaná Peninsula</a>. In 1859, after the <a>Federal War</a> began on February 20 in Coro, the area was declared the Independent State of Coro. In 1864, it became a federal state, part of the <a>United States of Venezuela</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Falc%C3%B3n_State">Falcón State</h3>
<p>
In 1872 the province was renamed Falcón State, in honor of the <a>Federal War</a> leader <a>Juan Crisóstomo Falcón</a>. In 1879, along with <a>Lara</a> and <a>Yaracuy</a>, minus the Department of <a>Nirgua</a>, it became part of the Western Northern State. Between 1881 and 1890 is formed, with Zulia, the state of Falcón-Zulia.

</p>
<p>
In 1891 Falcón was reestablished as a separate state. In 1899 its name changed, and for a short period of time, it retook its historical denomination of Estado Coro; returning in 1901 to tFalcón .

</p>
<p>
In 1899, the territory comprising the towns of <a>Tucacas</a> and <a>Chichiriviche</a>, was annexed by Falcón.  <a>Lara State</a> received the municipality of <a>Urdaneta</a>.

</p>
<p>
Coro, the capital, founded with the name of Santa Ana de Coro, was declared National Monument in 1950, and <a>UNESCO</a> has named it Cultural Patrimony of the Humanity in 1993.

</p>
<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
Falcón State is located in the north of the Corian System. To the south, Falcón contains medium-altitude mountain ranges configured from east to west, which in the eastern part of the state reach the <a>Caribbean Sea</a>, forming maritime valleys.

</p>
<p>
West from the city of Coro, a <a>coastal plain</a> runs parallel to the <a>Gulf of Venezuela</a>. To the north lies one of the most characteristic geographic features of the Venezuelan coast: the <a>Paraguana Peninsula</a>, linked to the mainland by the <a>isthmus</a> of <a>Médanos de Coro National Park</a>.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f0/Medanos_de_Coro_Falcon.jpg/220px-Medanos_de_Coro_Falcon.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<p>
A <a>semi-arid</a> climate of low rainfall dominates the western coast and the <a>Paraguaná Peninsula</a>. <a>Coro</a> receives 417 mm of rain per year, which usually falls in dry years, with an average temperature of 28.4 °C, while in <a>Punto Fijo</a> there are 316 mm of annual rainfall with average temperatures of 27.6 °C.

</p>
<p>
The extremely dry, desert conditions, with rainfall of less than 300 mm, are recognized on the western coasts of Coro and above all on the <a>isthmus</a> of Los Médanos de Coro, with average annual temperatures of between 28 and 29 °C. In the eastern coastal sectors, rainfall increases from 800 to 1200 mm per year, always with high temperatures. Somewhat more favourable, with temperatures between 25 and 27 °C, are the climatic conditions of the mountainous foothills, recognizing a sub-humid climate in the higher altitudes of the <a>Sierras de San Luis</a> and <a>Churuguara</a>, with an annual rainfall of 1300 mm and average temperatures of 22 °C.

</p>
<h3 id="Soils">Soils</h3>
<p>
On the coastline the soils are <a>calcareous</a>, and between the Lara and Falcón mountains, they are <a>clay</a>. They vary in quality, but in general, the availability of land for traditional <a>agriculture</a> can be classified as low, with 89% of very low potential, 3% of low potential and 6% of moderate potential.

</p>
<p>
Only 2% of it is located in the southeast valleys and <a>alluvial</a> areas, basins with very high potential. The limitations of the arid and semi-arid soils come from <a>salinity</a>, dryness caused by low rainfall, low concentration of organic matter and the influence of climatic agents such as wind.

</p>
<h3 id="Relief">Relief</h3>
<p>
The Corian System of Falcon State presents a diversity of landscapes ranging from coastal plains on its <a>Caribbean</a> side to mountain ranges formed by valleys and hills, in an area of transition between the two major mountain systems of the country. The <a>Sierra de San Luis</a> have the highest altitude of the entire system, but are of very modest height; the highest does not exceed 1600 meters (<a>Cerro Galicia</a><span> [<a>es</a>]</span>).

</p>
<p>
<a>Cerro Santa Ana</a> is another natural <a>Landmark</a>, located in the center of the <a>Paraguaná peninsula</a>. Unlike the rest of the peninsula, the characteristics of Santa Ana Hill are the contrast between its greenness and the <a>xerophytic</a> vegetation of the <a>Paraguaná</a> area. It has three peaks: the Santa Ana (the highest that ascends to about 830 meters above sea level), the <a>Buena Vista</a> and Moruy.

<p>
The state's <a>hydrography</a> is very poor. All the rivers flow north, either into the <a>Caribbean Sea</a> or the <a>Gulf of Venezuela</a>. However, the main Venezuelan river of the <a>Caribbean basin</a>, the <a>Tocuyo</a>, bathes a large area of the state before flowing into the Caribbean on the east coast of the state after travelling 423 km. Another river worth mentioning that flows into the Caribbean is Rio Aroa, with a length of 130 km. From the basin of the Gulf of Venezuela, the main ones are the Matícora (201 km) and the Mitare with 120 km.

<h3 id="Flora_%26%20Fauna">Flora & Fauna</h3>
<p>
The Marine <a>flora</a> is very rich. There is a great diversity of <a>algae</a> on the rocky shores and on the reef bottoms. The fishing potential of its waters is enormous and among the species that are extracted are <a>Shrimp</a>, <a>Octopus</a>, <a>Squid</a>, <a>Mackerel</a>, <a>corocoro</a>, <a>mullet</a>, <a>Horse mackerel</a>, <a>lebranche</a> and <a>dogfish</a>.

</p>
<p>
Other species require protection such as <a>sea turtles</a> and the <a>critically endangered</a><a>Orinoco Crocodile</a> . The latter inhabits the coastal mangroves of <a>Morrocoy</a>, Cuare and the isthmus, along with the sea <a>shearwater</a>, <a>herons</a>, <span><a>corocoras</a></span>, <a>gannets</a> and the <a>flamingo</a>. Among the invertebrates, the Hueque <a>scorpion</a> (Tityus falconensis) stands out, discovered in the caves of the <a>Juan Crisóstomo Falcón National Park</a> and which is distributed in a great part of the Falconian territory; the <a>giant scolopendra</a>, which is the largest centipede in the world, and the blue <a>tarantula</a> of Paraguaná (Chromatopelma cyaneopubescens) are also native.

</p>
<p>
In the cardonales and spines that occupy the lower areas, plants heavily armed with thorns predominate. The <span>cují yaque</span> (Falcón's emblematic tree), broom, yabo, <span>espinito</span>, tunas and <span>cardones</span> are common. <a>Aloe vera</a> and sisal crops are scattered throughout the region. In this environment, <a>bats</a>, savannah <a>rabbits</a>, common <a>foxes</a>, wild mice, <a>iguanas</a> and lizards stand out; and among the birds are the cardinal coriano and the paraulata llanera or chuchube (Mimus gilvus). It is also the endemic site of the Hueque scorpion (Tityus falconensis), a species of native scorpion whose distribution is excluded from the state of Falcon.

<p>
On the upper slopes of the mountains, cloud forests dominate where an enormous variety of ferns and palms grow. In the limestone formations of the Sierra you can find the guácharo, as well as interesting birds such as the blacksmith's bellbird and the emerald-billed toucan, and reptiles such as the nibbling turtle, a species endemic to the mountains of the <a>Sistema Coriano</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Geology">Geology</h3>
<p>
Early Cretaceous rocks cover the pre-existing sedimentary units in the South, in what is one of the thickest sections in South America. The rounded hills of the Cocodite table are supported by an ancient <a>igneous</a>-metromorphic complex and a poorly metamorphosed Jurassic succession.

</p>
<p>
To the east of Vela de Coro and Cumarebo, the foothills are supported by outcrops of the young Tertiary, also present to the north of Urumaco, where the stones are rough and darkened by iron oxide; while the plains concentrated in the lower part of the rivers are alluvial.

</p>
<p>
The arid plain presents quaternary earthquakes, with elevations sustained by rocks from the upper tertiary.

<p>
The main economic activity in terms of employment is agriculture, with important crops such as coconut, onions, corn, tomatoes, <a>patilla</a>, melon, coffee, aloe and <a>legumes</a>.

</p>
<p>
The state of Falcón is the largest producer of coconut and <a>copra</a>, goats and goat products. It is the second largest in the production of fish, paprika and vegetables such as onions, and third in bovine milk and melon production. It also has great advantages for the production of dry floor vegetables such as melon, onions, sideburns and tomatoes. Coconuts alone represent approximately 20,000 hectares in cultivation, and there is availability to expand surface area on the eastern coast of Falcón State. Falcón State is one of the main producers of <a>aloe vera</a> in Venezuela, and the coffee, region has 3500 hectares in cultivation, but with a provision of 12 700 hectares, distributed in the Sierra de Coro in the south of the federal entity.

</p>
<p>
In the mountains coffee is cultivated, having prestige the productions in the <a>Sierra de San Luis and Sierra de Churuguara</a>.

</p>
<p>
On the Eastern Coast, there are important plantations of coconut trees, which have developed an important industry of oil extraction and use of copra. As for livestock, there is an abundance of goats, cattle and, to a lesser extent, pigs.

</p>
<h3 id="Economic_activities">Economic activities</h3>
<p>
Falcon is the Venezuelan state with the most kilometres of coast, therefore the fishing activity has special dimensions. The annual production is 30,471 tons of fish and seafood, landed in the ports of <a>Las Piedras</a>, <a>Carirubana</a><span> [<a>es</a>]</span>, <a>Puerto Cumarebo</a>, Zazárida, <a>Chichiriviche</a>, and <a>La Vela de Coro</a>, highlighting the industrialization of crustaceans with the presence on the coast of the state of <a>shrimp farms</a>, as in Boca de Ricoa and at various points of the Paraguaná peninsula.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Villa_Caribe_Paraguana.JPG/220px-Villa_Caribe_Paraguana.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
In Falcón, there are some working oil fields in <a>Mene de Mauroa</a><span> [<a>es</a>]</span>, Media, Hombre Pintado and Tiguaje and natural gas fields in <a>Puerto Cumarebo</a> and other nearby areas. However, most oil industry activity is in the <a>Paraguaná Refining Center</a>, one of the largest in the world, made up of the Amuay Refining Complex and the Cardón Refinery, both with a capacity of 940,000 barrels of oil per day, which represents 75% of Venezuela's total refining capacity. These refineries are fed with crude oil and gas through products coming from the Maracaibo Lake basin. Likewise, a tourist investment free zone has been consolidated in the Paraguaná peninsula.

</p>
<p>
Falcón also has mineral deposits to generate basic inputs for industries such as ceramics, fertilizers, energy, chemicals, abrasives, metalworking, pharmaceuticals, pottery, and paint, among others. Phosphates are exploited in Riecito and limestone in Chichiriviche, which are processed at the Cumarebo cement plant (Holcim de Venezuela). It also has immense coal deposits in the western zone, with proven reserves for open-pit mining in the order of 20 million metric tons, and reserves estimated at 120 million metric tons, within a radius of action of 50,000 hectares. Other minerals in the area include graphite, silica, limestone, dolomite, phosphate, chromite and marble.

</p>
<p>
Thanks to the dry and arid climate, there are five natural salt flats and some 220,000 hectares of land suitable for the construction of artificial salt flats spread throughout the Falconian territory. Of all the salt mines, only the Las Cumaraguas salt mine is under industrial exploitation, the rest being exploited by hand.

</p>
<p>
Also, thanks to its natural landscapes (like the Medanos de Coro and the National Parks Cueva de la Quebrada del Toro, Sierra de San Luis and Morrocoy) tourism is gaining importance in the economy of the State.

<p>
<a>Coro</a>, the state capitol and the Paraguaná Peninsula have had significant amounts of <a>industrialization</a> and growth. Large <a>oil refineries</a> such as the <a>Paraguana Refinery Complex</a> in the city of <a>Punto Fijo</a> are located on the southwestern shore of the Paraguaná Peninsula, and approximately two-thirds of Venezuela's total oil production occurs in this area, much of which is exported via tanker ships that ship internationally through the port of <a>Amuay</a>.

<h3 id="Handicrafts">Handicrafts</h3>
<p>
Falconian craftsmanship is rich in artistic expression. Within the popular handicrafts are the hammocks with unique styles, techniques and values of the state. The craft production is large and varied. The craftsmen of the towns that surround the city of Coro specialize in the manufacture of furniture with the wood of the cardon, the stick of Arch and the curarí. The wood is complemented using vegetable fibres such as <a>sisal</a> or with cow and goat skins. In Paraguaná the clay is worked to build objects for current domestic use, applying the same techniques used by the Caquetíos Indians. On the eastern coast, the attraction is the basketwork made with bulrush, cocuiza and vines and the hammocks made with thread.

</p>
<h3 id="Gastronomy">Gastronomy</h3>
<p>
The typical Falconian food allows the enjoyment of a variety of flavors represented in its specialities, such as goat talkarí, <span>celce coriano</span>, goat milk cheese, custard, peeled arepa and goat milk candy. At a national level, rice with coconut and rice pudding is one of the most popular sweets, especially during the Easter season.

<h3 id="Folklore">Folklore</h3>
<p>
Folkloric, traditional and religious expressions offer a seal of originality in the state. In typical celebrations, features of African, indigenous and European cultures are associated. Among these celebrations is the Baile de las Turas, which has its origin in an indigenous dance related to the hunting season and the harvesting of the corn crop. It is celebrated in San Pedro, El Tural and Mapararí in the mountain region, between 23 and 24 September. The drum dances in the cities of Coro, La Vela and Puerto Cumarebo are very joyful and colourful, and the celebration of the Day of the Mad (December 28) in La Vela de Coro, with masked parades in the streets and public squares, reaches a display similar to that of the great carnivals of the world.
