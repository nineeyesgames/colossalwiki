<b>South Korea</b>,<sup><a href="#ref_b">[b]</a></sup> officially the <b>Republic of Korea</b> (<b>ROK</b>),<sup><a href="#ref_c">[c]</a></sup> is a <a>country</a> in <a>East Asia</a>, constituting the southern part of the <a>Korean Peninsula</a> and sharing a <a>land border</a> with <a>North Korea</a>. Its western border is formed by the <a>Yellow Sea</a>, while its eastern border is defined by the <a>Sea of Japan</a>. About 25 million people, around half of the <a>country's population</a> of 51 million, live in the <a>Seoul Capital Area</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the <a>Lower Paleolithic</a> period. Its <a>first kingdom</a> was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the <a>Three Kingdoms of Korea</a> into <a>Silla</a> and <a>Balhae</a> in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the <a>Goryeo dynasty</a> (918–1392) and the <a>Joseon dynasty</a> (1392–1897). The succeeding <a>Korean Empire</a> was <a>annexed in 1910</a> into the <a>Empire of Japan</a>. <a>Japanese rule in Korea</a> ended following <a>the former's surrender</a> in <a>World War II</a>, after which Korea was <a>divided into two zones</a>; a <a>northern</a> zone occupied by the <a>Soviet Union</a> and a <a>southern</a> zone <a>occupied</a> by the <a>United States</a>. After negotiations on <a>reunification</a> failed, the latter became the Republic of Korea in August 1948 while the former became North Korea.

</p>
<p>
In 1950, a <a>North Korean invasion</a> began the <a>Korean War</a>, which saw extensive <a>United States</a>-led <a>U.N. intervention</a> in support of the South, while <a>China</a> intervened to <a>support the North</a> with <a>Soviet assistance</a>. After <a>the war's end</a> in 1953, the country's economy <a>began to soar</a>, recording the <a>fastest rise in average GDP per capita</a> in the world between 1980 and 1990. The <a>June Struggle</a> led to the <a>end of authoritarian rule in 1987</a> and the country is now considered among the <a>most advanced democracies</a> in Asia, with the highest level of <a>press freedom</a>. However, <a>corruption</a> and <a>political scandals</a> have become growing problems in recent years; both living former South Korean <a>presidents</a> have been sentenced to prison for various crimes ranging from abuse of authority to <a>bribery</a> and <a>embezzlement</a> and are still serving their sentences.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea is a <a>developed country</a> and is ranked as the <a>seventh-highest country</a> on the <a>Human Development Index</a> (HDI) in the Asia and Oceania region. Its <a>economy</a> ranks as the world's <a>tenth-largest by nominal GDP</a>. Its citizens enjoy one of the world's <a>fastest Internet connection speeds</a> and the <a>densest high-speed railway network</a>. The country is the world's <a>fifth-largest exporter</a> and <a>eighth-largest importer</a>. South Korea was in 2017 the world's 7th largest emitter of carbon emissions and the 5th largest emitter per capita. Since the 21st century, South Korea has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture, particularly in music (<a>K-pop</a>), <a>TV dramas</a> and <a>cinema</a>, a phenomenon referred to as the <a>Korean Wave</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> It is a member of the <a>OECD</a>'s <a>Development Assistance Committee</a>, the <a>G20</a>, and the <a>Paris Club</a>.

<p>
The name <i>Korea</i> derives from the name <i>Goryeo</i>. The name <i>Goryeo</i> itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of <a>Goguryeo</a>, which was considered a <a>great power</a> of East Asia during its time, in the 5th century as a shortened form of its name.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> The 10th-century kingdom of <a>Goryeo</a> succeeded Goguryeo,<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup>and thus inherited its name, which was pronounced by the visiting Persian merchants as "Korea".<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> The modern name of Koreia, appears in the first Portuguese maps of 1568 by João vaz Dourado as <i>Conrai</i><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>  and later in the late 16th century and early 17th century as Korea (Corea) in the maps of Teixeira Albernaz of 1630.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The kingdom of <i>Goryeo</i> became first known to Westerners when <a>Afonso de Albuquerque</a> conquered Malacca in 1511 and described the peoples who traded with this part of the world known by the Portuguese as the Gores.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>  Despite the coexistence of the spellings <i>Corea</i> and <i>Korea</i> in 19th century publications, some Koreans believe that <a>Imperial Japan</a>, around the time of the Japanese occupation, intentionally standardized the spelling on <i>Korea</i>, making <a>Japan</a> appear first alphabetically.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After Goryeo was replaced by Joseon in 1392, Joseon became the official name for the entire territory, though it was not universally accepted.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The new official name has its origin in the ancient kingdom of <a>Gojoseon</a> (2333 BCE). In 1897, the <a>Joseon</a> dynasty changed the official name of the country from <i>Joseon</i> to <i>Daehan Jeguk</i> (<a>Korean Empire</a>). The name <i>Daehan</i> (Great Han) derives from <a>Samhan</a> (Three Han), referring to the <a>Three Kingdoms of Korea</a>, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> However, the name <i>Joseon</i> was still widely used by Koreans to refer to their country, though it was no longer the official name. Under <a>Japanese rule</a>, the two names <i>Han</i> and <i>Joseon</i> coexisted. There were several groups who <a>fought for independence</a>, the most notable being the <i><a>Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea</a></i> (<span>대한민국 임시정부</span> / <span>大韓民國臨時政府</span>).

</p>
<p>
Following the <a>surrender of Japan</a>, in 1945, the "Republic of Korea" (<span>대한민국</span> / <span>大韓民國</span>, <a>IPA</a>: <span>ˈtɛ̝ːɦa̠nminɡuk̚</span>, <abbr>lit.</abbr><span></span>'Great Korean People's State'; <span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>) was adopted as the legal English name for the new country. However, it is not a direct translation of the Korean name.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> As a result, the Korean name "Daehan Minguk" is sometimes used by South Koreans as a <a>metonym</a> to refer to the Korean ethnicity (or "<a>race</a>") as a whole, rather than just the South Korean state.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> Conversely, the official name of North Korea in English, the "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", is a direct translation of the Korean name.

</p>
<p>
Since the government only controlled the southern part of the <a>Korean Peninsula</a>, the informal term "South Korea" was coined, becoming increasingly common in the <a>Western world</a>. While South Koreans use <i>Han</i> (or <i>Hanguk</i>) to refer to both Koreas collectively, North Koreans and ethnic Koreans living in China and Japan use the term <i>Joseon</i> instead.

The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the <a>Lower Paleolithic</a> period.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> The <a>history of Korea</a> begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as "<a>Gojoseon</a>", or Old Joseon, to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BCE by <a>Dangun</a>, according to Korea's <a>foundation mythology</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of <a>Manchuria</a>. <a>Gija Joseon</a> was purportedly founded in the 12th century BCE, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> In 108 BCE, the <a>Han dynasty</a><a>defeated</a><a>Wiman Joseon</a>   and installed <a>four commanderies</a> in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades. As <a>Lelang commandery</a> was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward Liaodong. Thus, its force was diminished and it only served as a trade center until it was conquered by <a>Goguryeo</a> in 313.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Three_Kingdoms%20of%20Korea">Three Kingdoms of Korea</h3>
<p>
During the period known as the <a>Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea</a>, the states of <a>Buyeo</a>, <a>Okjeo</a>, <a>Dongye</a> and <a>Samhan</a> occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, <a>Goguryeo</a>, <a>Baekje</a> and <a>Silla</a> emerged to control the peninsula as the <a>Three Kingdoms of Korea</a>. Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state,<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under <a>Gwanggaeto the Great</a> and his son <a>Jangsu</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their times, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> In addition to contesting for control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many <a>military conflicts</a> with various Chinese dynasties,<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> most notably the <a>Goguryeo–Sui War</a>, in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup> Baekje was a great maritime power;<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> its nautical skill, which made it the <a>Phoenicia</a> of East Asia, was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and continental culture to Japan.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of <a>Geunchogo</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>self-published source</span></a></i>]</sup> Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but it used cunning diplomatic means to make opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually <a>Tang China</a>, to its great advantage.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the <a>North South States Period</a>, in which much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by <a>Later Silla</a>, while <a>Balhae</a> controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo. Balhae was founded by a <a>Goguryeo general</a> and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East, and was called the "Prosperous Country in the East".<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup><a>Later Silla</a>  was a golden age of art and culture,<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> as evidenced by the <a>Hwangnyongsa</a>, <a>Seokguram</a>, and <a>Emille Bell</a>. Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. Later Silla carried on the maritime prowess of <a>Baekje</a>, which acted like the <a>Phoenicia</a> of medieval <a>East Asia</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of <a>Jang Bogo</a>; in addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the <a>Shandong Peninsula</a> and the mouth of the <a>Yangtze River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> Later Silla was a prosperous and wealthy country,<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> and its metropolitan capital of <a>Gyeongju</a><sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup> was the fourth largest city in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup> Buddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> and contributed to Chinese Buddhism,<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> including: <a>Woncheuk</a>, <a>Wonhyo</a>, <a>Uisang</a>, <a>Musang</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup> and <a>Kim Gyo-gak</a>, a Silla prince whose influence made <a>Mount Jiuhua</a> one of the Four <a>Sacred Mountains</a> of Chinese Buddhism.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup> However, Later Silla weakened under internal strife and the revival of <a>Baekje</a> and <a>Goguryeo</a>, which led to the <a>Later Three Kingdoms period</a> in the late 9th century.

<p>
In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by <a>Wang Geon</a>, a descendant of Goguryeo nobility,<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> who established <a>Goryeo</a> as the successor state of <a>Goguryeo</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> Balhae had fallen to the <a>Khitan Empire</a> in 926, and a decade later the <a>last crown prince of Balhae</a> fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type <a>printing press</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup> After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time,<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup> in the <a>Goryeo–Khitan War</a>, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the <a>Tripitaka Koreana</a> was completed and there were great developments in printing and publishing, promoting learning and dispersing knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science; by 1100, there were 12 universities that produced famous scholars and scientists.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> However, the <a>Mongol invasions</a> in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its <a>crown prince</a> to the <a>Yuan</a> capital to swear allegiance to <a>Kublai Khan</a>, who accepted, and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses,<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> and the <a>last empress</a> of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean princess. In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered <a>Liaoyang</a>, and defeated invasions by the <a>Red Turbans</a>. However, in 1392, General <a>Yi Seong-gye</a>, who had been ordered to attack China, turned his army around and staged a coup.

</p>
<p>
Yi Seong-gye declared the new name of Korea as "Joseon" in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of <a>Seoul</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace, and saw great advancements in science<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup> and education,<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup> as well as the creation of <a>Hangul</a> by <a>Sejong the Great</a> to promote literacy among the common people.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> The prevailing ideology of the time was <a>Neo-Confucianism</a>, which was epitomized by the <a>seonbi</a> class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598, <a>Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> launched <a>invasions of Korea</a>, but his advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the <a>Joseon Navy</a> led by Admiral <a>Yi Sun-sin</a> and his renowned "<a>turtle ship</a>")<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup> with assistance from <a>Righteous Army</a> militias formed by Korean civilians, and <a>Ming dynasty</a> Chinese troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the <a>Manchus</a> took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and <a>invaded</a> in 1627 and 1637, and then went on to <a>conquer</a> the destabilized Ming dynasty. After normalizing relations with the new <a>Qing dynasty</a>, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings <a>Yeongjo</a> and <a>Jeongjo</a> particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> In the 19th century, the royal in-law families gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state, and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country. Furthermore, the Joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy, earning the nickname "the <a>hermit kingdom</a>", but ultimately failed to protect itself against <a>imperialism</a> and was forced to open its borders. After the <a>First Sino-Japanese War</a> and the <a>Russo-Japanese War</a>, Korea was <a>annexed by Japan</a> (1910–1945). Towards the end of <a>World War II</a>, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones (a U.S. and Soviet one). <a>Dean Rusk</a> and <a>Charles H. Bonesteel III</a> suggested the <a>38th parallel</a> as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup>

<p>
Despite the initial plan of a <a>unified Korea</a> in the <a>1943 Cairo Declaration</a>, escalating <a>Cold War</a> antagonism between the <a>Soviet Union</a> and the <a>United States</a> eventually led to the establishment of separate governments, each with its own ideology, leading to the <a>division of Korea</a> into two political entities in 1948: <a>North Korea</a> and South Korea. In the South, <a>Syngman Rhee</a>, an opponent of communism, who had been backed and appointed by the United States as head of the provisional government, won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May. In the North, however, a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, <a>Kim Il-sung</a>, was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September.

</p>
<p>
In October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il-sung's government as sovereign over both parts. The UN declared Rhee's government as "a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult" and the Government "based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission" in addition to a statement that "this is the only such government in Korea."<sup><a href="#ref_125">[125]</a></sup> Both leaders began an authoritarian repression of their political opponents inside their region, seeking for a unification of Korea under their control. While South Korea's request for military support was denied by the United States, North Korea's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.

</p>
<p>
On 25 June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the <a>Korean War</a>, the Cold War's first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the United Nations (UN), thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of <a>Chinese troops</a>. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the <a>One-People Principle</a> (based on the German <a>ideology</a> of the <i><a>Herrenvolk</a></i>) an effort to build an obedient citizenry through <a>ethnic</a> homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to <a>nationalism</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_126">[126]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the <a>demilitarized zone</a> near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than <a>World War II</a> or the <a>Vietnam War</a>, making it perhaps the deadliest conflict of the Cold War-era. In addition, virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed by the war.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_129">[129]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_131">[131]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
In 1960, <a>a student uprising</a> (the "April 19 Revolution") led to the resignation of the autocratic <a>then-President Syngman Rhee</a>. This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government.  This instability was broken by the <a>16 May 1961, coup</a> led by General <a>Park Chung-hee</a>. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid <a>export-led economic growth</a> enforced by political repression.

</p>
<p>
Park was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a <a>new constitution</a>, which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The <a>Korean economy</a> developed significantly during Park's tenure.  The government developed the <a>nationwide expressway system</a>, the <a>Seoul subway system</a>, and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with <a>his assassination</a> in 1979.

</p>
<p>
The years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General <a>Chun Doo-hwan</a> led the <a>Coup d'état of December Twelfth</a>. Following the Coup d'état, Chun Doo-hwan planned to rise to power through several measures. On 17 May, Chun Doo-hwan forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of <a>Jejudo</a>. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the events of 17 May triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly focused in the city of <a>Gwangju</a>, to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the <a>Gwangju Democratization Movement</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_132">[132]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a <a>Seoul National University</a> student, <a>Park Jong-chul</a>, was tortured to death.<sup><a href="#ref_133">[133]</a></sup> On <span>10 June</span>, the <a>Catholic Priests Association for Justice</a> revealed the incident, igniting the <a>June Democracy Movement</a> around the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the <a>Democratic Justice Party</a>, and its leader, <a>Roh Tae-woo</a>, announced the 6.29 Declaration, which included the direct election of the president. Roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, <a>Kim Dae-jung</a> and <a>Kim Young-sam</a>. Seoul hosted the <a>Olympic Games in 1988</a>, widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South Korea's global image and economy.<sup><a href="#ref_134">[134]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>South Korea was formally invited</a> to become a member of the <a>United Nations</a> in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea, on 25 February 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile). He won against the backdrop of the <a>1997 Asian Financial Crisis</a>, where he took <a>IMF</a> advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.<sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup>

<p>
In June 2000, as part of president Kim Dae-jung's "<a>Sunshine Policy</a>" of engagement, a <a>North–South summit</a> took place in <a>Pyongyang</a>, the capital of North Korea. Later that year, Kim received the <a>Nobel Peace Prize</a> "for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular".<sup><a href="#ref_136">[136]</a></sup> However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North Korean provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President <a>Lee Myung-bak</a>, former <a>mayor of Seoul</a>. Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan jointly co-hosted the <a>2002 FIFA World Cup</a>. However, <a>South Korean and Japanese relations</a> later <a>soured</a> because of conflicting claims of <a>sovereignty</a> over the <a>Liancourt Rocks</a>.

<p>
In 2010, there was an <a>escalation in attacks</a> by North Korea. In March 2010 the South Korean warship <a>ROKS Cheonan</a> was sunk with the loss of 46 South Korean sailors, allegedly by a North Korean submarine. In November 2010 <a>Yeonpyeong</a> island was attacked by a significant North Korean artillery barrage, with 4 people losing their lives. The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both South Korea and the international community (the official UN report declined to explicitly name North Korea as the perpetrator for the <a>Cheonan</a> sinking) caused significant anger with the South Korean public.<sup><a href="#ref_138">[138]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea saw another milestone in 2012 with the first ever female president <a>Park Geun-hye</a><a>elected</a>  and assuming office. Daughter of another former president, <a>Park Chung-hee</a>, she carried on a conservative brand of politics. President Park Geun-hye's administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of close friend <a>Choi Soon-sil</a> in state affairs. There followed a series of <a>massive public demonstrations</a> from November 2016<sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup> and she was removed from office.<sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup> After the fallout of President Park's impeachment and dismissal, new elections were held and <a>Moon Jae-in</a> of the Democratic party won the presidency, assuming office on 10 May 2017. His tenure so far has seen an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of <a>the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_141">[141]</a></sup><a>The COVID-19 pandemic</a>  affected the nation in 2020. That same year, South Korea recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.<sup><a href="#ref_142">[142]</a></sup>

<p>
South Korea occupies the southern portion of the <a>Korean Peninsula</a>, which extends some 1,100 km (680 mi) from the Asian mainland. This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the <a>Yellow Sea</a> to the west, and the <a>Sea of Japan</a> to the east. Its southern tip lies on the <a>Korea Strait</a> and the <a>East China Sea</a>.

</p>
<p>
The country, including all its islands, lies between latitudes <a>33°</a> and <a>39°N</a>, and longitudes <a>124°</a> and <a>130°E</a>. Its total area is 100,032 square kilometers (38,622.57 sq mi).<sup><a href="#ref_143">[143]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow <a>coastal plains</a>; a western region of broad coastal plains, <a>river basins</a>, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the <a>Nakdong River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> South Korea is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: <a>Central Korean deciduous forests</a>, <a>Manchurian mixed forests</a>, and <a>Southern Korea evergreen forests</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_145">[145]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea's terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not <a>arable</a>. <a>Lowlands</a>, located primarily in the west and southeast, make up only 30% of the total land area.

</p>
<p>
About three thousand islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea. <a>Jeju-do</a> is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the southern coast of South Korea. It is the country's largest island, with an area of 1,845 square kilometers (712 square miles). Jeju is also the site of South Korea's highest point: <a>Hallasan</a>, an extinct <a>volcano</a>, reaches 1,950 meters (6,400 feet) <a>above sea level</a>. The easternmost islands of South Korea include <a>Ulleungdo</a> and <a>Liancourt Rocks</a> (Dokdo/Takeshima), while <a>Marado</a> and <a>Socotra Rock</a> are the southernmost islands of South Korea.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea has <a>20 national parks</a> and popular nature places like the <a>Boseong</a> Tea Fields, <a>Suncheon Bay Ecological Park</a>, and the first national park of <a>Jirisan</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_146">[146]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_South_Korea">Climate of South Korea</a></div>
<p>
South Korea tends to have a <a>humid continental climate</a> and a <a>humid subtropical climate</a>, and is affected by the <a>East Asian monsoon</a>, with <a>precipitation</a> heavier in summer during a short rainy season called <i><a>jangma</a></i> (<a>장마</a>), which begins end of June through the end of July. Winters can be extremely cold with the minimum temperature dropping below −20 °C (−4 °F) in the inland region of the country: in Seoul, the average January temperature range is −7 to 1 °C (19 to 34 °F), and the average August temperature range is 22 to 30 °C (72 to 86 °F). Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior.<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup> Summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding 30 °C (86 °F) in most parts of the country. South Korea has four distinct seasons; spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring usually lasts from late March to early May, summer from mid-May to early September, autumn from mid-September to early November, and winter from mid-November to mid-March.

</p>
<p>
Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer <a>typhoons</a> that bring strong winds, heavy rains and sometimes floods. The average annual precipitation varies from 1,370 millimeters (54 in) in <a>Seoul</a> to 1,470 millimeters (58 in) in <a>Busan</a>.

<p>
During the first 20 years of South Korea's growth surge, little effort was made to preserve the environment.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> Unchecked industrialization and urban development have resulted in deforestation and the ongoing destruction of wetlands such as the Songdo Tidal Flat.<sup><a href="#ref_150">[150]</a></sup> However, there have been recent efforts to balance these problems, including a government run <span>$84 billion</span> five-year <a>green growth</a> project that aims to boost energy efficiency and green technology.<sup><a href="#ref_151">[151]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The green-based economic strategy is a comprehensive overhaul of South Korea's economy, utilizing nearly two percent of the national GDP. The greening initiative includes such efforts as a nationwide bike network, solar and wind energy, lowering oil dependent vehicles, backing daylight saving time and extensive usage of environmentally friendly technologies such as LEDs in electronics and lighting.<sup><a href="#ref_152">[152]</a></sup> The country – already the world's most wired – plans to build a nationwide next-generation network that will be 10 times faster than broadband facilities, in order to reduce energy usage.<sup><a href="#ref_152">[152]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>renewable portfolio standard</a> program with <a>renewable energy certificates</a> runs from 2012 to 2022.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>
Quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more difficult to design and implement than a <a>Feed-in tariff</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup> Around 350 residential <a>micro combined heat and power</a> units were installed in 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_155">[155]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2017, South Korea was the world's 7th largest emitter of carbon emissions and the 5th largest emitter per capita. The president <a>Moon Jae-in</a> pledged to reduce <a>greenhouse gas emissions</a> – which contribute to <a>climate change</a> – to zero in 2050.<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Seoul's <a>tap water</a> recently became safe to drink, with city officials branding it "<a>Arisu</a>" in a bid to convince the public.<sup><a href="#ref_158">[158]</a></sup> Efforts have also been made with <a>afforestation</a> projects. Another multibillion-dollar project was the restoration of <a>Cheonggyecheon</a>, a stream running through downtown Seoul that had earlier been paved over by a motorway.<sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup> One major challenge is air quality, with <a>acid rain</a>, sulfur oxides, and annual yellow dust storms being particular problems.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> It is acknowledged that many of these difficulties are a result of South Korea's proximity to China, which is a major air polluter.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> South Korea had a 2019 <a>Forest Landscape Integrity Index</a> mean score of 6.02/10, ranking it 87th globally out of 172 countries.<sup><a href="#ref_160">[160]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea is a member of the <a>Antarctic-Environmental Protocol</a>, <a>Antarctic Treaty</a>, <a>Biodiversity Treaty</a>, <a>Kyoto Protocol</a> (forming the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), regarding <a>UNFCCC</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup> with <a>Mexico</a> and <a>Switzerland</a>), <a>Desertification</a>, <a>Endangered Species</a>, <a>Environmental Modification</a>, <a>Hazardous Wastes</a>, <a>Law of the Sea</a>, <a>Marine Dumping</a>, <a>Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty</a> (not into force), <a>Ozone Layer Protection</a>, <a>Ship Pollution</a>, <a>Tropical Timber 83</a>, <a>Tropical Timber 94</a>, <a>Wetlands</a>, and <a>Whaling</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup>

<p>
The South Korean government's structure is determined by the <a>Constitution of the Republic of Korea</a>. Like many democratic states,<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup> South Korea has a government divided into three branches: <a>executive</a>, <a>judicial</a>, and <a>legislative</a>. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. Local governments are semi-autonomous, and contain executive and <a>legislative bodies</a> of their own. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. South Korea is a constitutional democracy.

<p>
The constitution has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence. However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived <a>Second Republic of South Korea</a>, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive.<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup> Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the <a>Sixth Republic of South Korea</a>. The first direct <a>election</a> was also held in 1948.

</p>
<p>
Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful <a>liberal democracy</a>. Today, the <a>CIA World Factbook</a> describes South Korea's democracy as a "fully functioning modern democracy".<sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup> South Korea is ranked 45th on the <a>Corruption Perceptions Index</a> (9th in the <a>Asia-Pacific</a> region), with a score of 57 out of 100.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup>

In April 2016, South Korea's population was estimated to be around 50.8 million by <a>National Statistical Office</a>, with continuing decline of working age population and total fertility rate.<sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_171">[171]</a></sup> In a further indication of South Korea's dramatic decline in fertility, in 2020 the country recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time since modern records began.<sup><a href="#ref_172">[172]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_173">[173]</a></sup> The country is noted for its population density, which was an estimated 505 per square kilometer in 2015,<sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> more than 10 times the global average. Aside from micro-states and city-states, South Korea is the world's third most densely-populated country.<sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup> In practice the population density in much of South Korea is higher than the national one, as most of the country's land is uninhabitable due to being used for other purposes such as farming.<sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup> Most South Koreans live in urban areas, because of rapid migration from the countryside during the country's quick economic expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.<sup><a href="#ref_175">[175]</a></sup> The capital city of <a>Seoul</a> is also the country's largest city and chief industrial center. According to the 2005 census, Seoul had a population of <span>10 million</span> inhabitants. The <a>Seoul National Capital Area</a> has <span>24.5 million</span> inhabitants (about half of South Korea's entire population) making it the world's second largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include <a>Busan</a> (<span>3.5 million</span>), <a>Incheon</a> (<span>3.0 million</span>), <a>Daegu</a> (<span>2.5 million</span>), <a>Daejeon</a> (<span>1.4 million</span>), <a>Gwangju</a> (<span>1.4 million</span>) and <a>Ulsan</a> (<span>1.1 million</span>).<sup><a href="#ref_176">[176]</a></sup>

<p>
The population has also been shaped by international migration. After World War II and the <a>division of the Korean Peninsula</a>, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration, especially to North America through the United States and Canada. South Korea's total population in 1955 was <span>21.5 million</span>,<sup><a href="#ref_177">[177]</a></sup> and has more than doubled, to 50 million, by 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea is considered one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world <a>with ethnic Koreans representing approximately 96%</a> of total population. Precise numbers are difficult since statistics do not record ethnicity and given many <a>immigrants are ethnically Korean</a> themselves, and some South Korean citizens are not ethnically Korean.<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup>

The percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly.<sup><a href="#ref_180">[180]</a></sup> As of 2016<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, South Korea had 1,413,758 foreign residents, 2.75% of the population;<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup> however, many of them are ethnic Koreans with a foreign citizenship. For example, <a>migrants from China (PRC)</a> make up 56.5% of foreign nationals, but approximately 70% of the Chinese citizens in Korea are <i><a>Joseonjok</a></i> (<span>조선족</span>), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity.<sup><a href="#ref_181">[181]</a></sup> Regardless of the ethnicity, there are 28,500 <a>US military</a> personnel serving in South Korea, most serving a one-year unaccompanied tour (though approximately 10% serve longer tours accompanied by family), according to the Korea National Statistical Office.<sup><a href="#ref_182">[182]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_183">[183]</a></sup> In addition, about 43,000 English teachers from <a>English-speaking countries</a> reside temporarily in Korea.<sup><a href="#ref_184">[184]</a></sup> Currently, South Korea has one of the highest rates of growth of foreign born population, with about 30,000 foreign born residents obtaining South Korean citizenship every year since 2010.

<p>
Large numbers of ethnic Koreans live overseas, sometimes in Korean ethnic neighbourhoods also known as <a>Koreatowns</a>.

A centralized administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school. The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins at the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February. The schedules are not uniformly standardized and vary from school to school. Most South Korean middle schools and high schools have school uniforms, modeled on western-style uniforms. Boys' uniforms usually consist of trousers and white shirts, and girls wear skirts and white shirts (this only applies in middle schools and high schools). The country adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010. According to the <a>Ministry of Education, Science and Technology</a>, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea would have (under the program) doubled by that time, and the number of foreign students would have reached 100,000.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea is one of the top-performing <a>OECD</a> countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 519, compared with the OECD average of 492, placing it ninth in the world. The country has one of the world's highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries.<sup><a href="#ref_197">[197]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_199">[199]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_200">[200]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_201">[201]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_202">[202]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup> The country is well known for its highly feverish outlook on education, where its national obsession with education has been called "education fever".<sup><a href="#ref_203">[203]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_204">[204]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_205">[205]</a></sup> This obsession with education has catapulted the resource-poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. In 2014, South Korea ranked second worldwide (after Singapore) in the national rankings of students' math and science scores by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) .<sup><a href="#ref_206">[206]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Higher education is a serious issue in South Korean society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is often a source of pride for families and within South Korean society at large, and is a necessity to improve one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society.<sup><a href="#ref_207">[207]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_208">[208]</a></sup> South Koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family, as a gateway to the South Korean middle class. Graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path.<sup><a href="#ref_209">[209]</a></sup> The entrance into a top-tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, or a major South Korean conglomerate such as <a>Samsung</a>, <a>Hyundai</a> or <a>LG Electronics</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_210">[210]</a></sup> With incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nation's best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. The top three universities in South Korea, often referred to as "SKY", are <a>Seoul National University</a>, <a>Korea University</a> and <a>Yonsei University</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup> An average South Korean student's life revolves around education, with intense competition for top grades, pressure to succeed academically and being the top student deeply ingrained in the psyche of South Korean students at a young age.<sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup> Yet with only so many places at the nation's most prestigious universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as though they are underachievers. There is a major cultural taboo in South Korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education, where those who do not hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens. This often results in fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of one's socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.<sup><a href="#ref_213">[213]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup>

<p>
In 2015, the country spent 5.1% of its GDP on all levels of education – roughly 0.8 percentage points above the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 4.3%.<sup><a href="#ref_215">[215]</a></sup> A strong investment in education, a militant drive for success, as well as the passion for excellence has helped the resource-poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland to a prosperous first-world country.<sup><a href="#ref_216">[216]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
International opinion regarding the South Korean education system has been divided. It has been praised for various reasons, including its comparatively high test results and its major role in generating South Korea's <a>economic development</a>, creating one of the world's most educated workforces.<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup>
South Korea's highly enviable academic performance has persuaded British education ministers to actively remodel their own curriculums and exams to try to emulate Korea's militant drive and passion for excellence and high educational achievement.<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup> Former U.S. President <a>Barack Obama</a> has also praised the country's rigorous school system, where over 80 percent of South Korean high school graduates go on to university.<sup><a href="#ref_218">[218]</a></sup> The nation's high university entrance rate has created a highly skilled workforce, making South Korea among the most highly educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.<sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup> In 2017, the country ranked fifth for the percentage of 25 to 64 year old's that have attained tertiary education with 47.7 percent.<sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup> In addition, 69.8 percent of South Koreans aged 25–34 have completed some form of tertiary education qualification, and bachelor's degrees are held by 34.2 percent of South Koreans aged 25–64, the most in the OECD.<sup><a href="#ref_215">[215]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The system's rigid and hierarchical structure has been criticized for stifling creativity and innovation;<sup><a href="#ref_220">[220]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup> described as intensely and "brutally" competitive,<sup><a href="#ref_222">[222]</a></sup> the system is often blamed for the high <a>suicide</a> rate in the country, particularly the growing rates among those aged 10–19. Various media outlets attribute the country's high suicide rate to the nationwide anxiety around the country's college entrance exams, which determine the trajectory of students' entire lives and careers.<sup><a href="#ref_223">[223]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_224">[224]</a></sup> Former South Korean <i><a>hagwon</a></i> teacher Se-Woong Koo wrote that the South Korean education system amounts to <a>child abuse</a> and that it should be "reformed and restructured without delay".<sup><a href="#ref_225">[225]</a></sup> The system has also been criticized for producing an excess supply of university graduates creating an overeducated and underemployed labor force; in the first quarter of 2013 alone, nearly 3.3 million South Korean university graduates were jobless, leaving many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education.<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> Further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in South Korean society.<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_227">[227]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_228">[228]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_230">[230]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_231">[231]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_232">[232]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
Korean is the official language of South Korea, and is classified by most linguists as a <a>language isolate</a>. It incorporates a significant number of loan words from Chinese. Korean uses an indigenous writing system called <a>Hangul</a>, created in 1446 by <a>King Sejong</a>, to provide a convenient alternative to the <a>Classical Chinese</a><a>Hanja</a>  characters that were difficult to learn and did not fit the Korean language well. South Korea still uses some Chinese Hanja characters in limited areas, such as print media and legal documentation.

</p>
<p>
The Korean language in South Korea has a <a>standard dialect</a> known as the <a>Seoul dialect</a> (after the capital city), with an additional four dialects (<a>Chungcheong</a>, <a>Gangwon</a>, <a>Gyeongsang</a>, and <a>Jeolla</a>) and one language (<a>Jeju</a>) in use around the country.

</p>
<p>
Almost all South Korean students today learn <a>English</a> throughout their education, with some optionally choosing Japanese or Mandarin as well.<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup>

According to the results of the census of 2015, more than half of the South Korean population (56.1%) declared themselves not affiliated with any <a>religious organizations</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> In a 2012 survey, 52% declared themselves "religious", 31% said they were "not religious" and 15% identified themselves as "convinced <a>atheists</a>".<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup> Of the people who are affiliated with a religious organization, most are <a>Christians</a> and <a>Buddhists</a>. According to the 2015 census, 27.6% of the population were Christians (19.7% identified themselves as Protestants, 7.9% as Roman Catholics) and 15.5% were Buddhists.<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> Other religions include <a>Islam</a> (130,000 Muslims, mostly migrant workers from Pakistan and Bangladesh but including some 35,000 Korean Muslims<sup><a href="#ref_237">[237]</a></sup>), the homegrown sect of <a>Won Buddhism</a>, and a variety of indigenous religions, including <a>Cheondoism</a> (a <a>Confucianizing</a> religion), <a>Jeungsanism</a>, <a>Daejongism</a>, <a>Daesun Jinrihoe</a>, and others. <a>Freedom of religion</a> is guaranteed by the constitution, and there is no <a>state religion</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_238">[238]</a></sup> Overall, between the 2005 and 2015 censuses, there has been a slight decline of Christianity (down from 29% to 27.6%), a sharp decline of Buddhism (down from 22.8% to 15.5%), and a rise of the unaffiliated population (from 47.2% to 56.9%).<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Christianity is South Korea's largest organized religion, accounting for more than half of all South Korean adherents of religious organizations. There are approximately 13.5 million Christians in South Korea today; about two thirds of them belonging to Protestant churches, and the rest to the Catholic Church.<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> The number of Protestants has been stagnant throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, but increased to a peak level throughout the 2010s. Roman Catholics increased significantly between the 1980s and the 2000s, but declined throughout the 2010s.<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> Christianity, unlike in other East Asian countries, found fertile ground in Korea in the 18th century, and by the end of the 18th century it persuaded a large part of the population, as the declining monarchy supported it and opened the country to widespread <a>proselytism</a> as part of a project of Westernization. The weakness of Korean <a>Sindo</a>, which - unlike Japanese <a>Shinto</a> and <a>China's religious system</a> - never developed into a national religion of high status,<sup><a href="#ref_239">[239]</a></sup> combined with the impoverished state of <a>Korean Buddhism</a>, (after 500 years of suppression at the hands of the Joseon state, by the 20th century it was virtually extinct) left a free hand to Christian churches. Christianity's similarity to native religious narratives has been studied as another factor that contributed to its success in the peninsula.<sup><a href="#ref_240">[240]</a></sup> The <a>Japanese colonization</a> of the first half of the 20th century further strengthened the identification of Christianity with <a>Korean nationalism</a>, as the Japanese coopted native Korean Sindo into the Nipponic <a>Imperial Shinto</a> that they tried to establish in the peninsula.<sup><a href="#ref_241">[241]</a></sup> Widespread Christianization of the Koreans took place during State Shinto,<sup><a href="#ref_241">[241]</a></sup> after its abolition, and then in the independent South Korea as the newly established military government supported Christianity and <a>tried to utterly oust</a> native Sindo.

Among Christian denominations, <a>Presbyterianism</a> is the largest. About nine million people belong to one of the hundred different Presbyterian churches; the biggest ones are the <a>HapDong Presbyterian Church</a>, <a>TongHap Presbyterian Church</a> and the <a>Koshin Presbyterian Church</a>. South Korea is also the second-largest missionary-sending nation, after the United States.<sup><a href="#ref_242">[242]</a></sup>

Buddhism was introduced to Korea in the 4th century.<sup><a href="#ref_243">[243]</a></sup> It soon became a dominant religion in the southeastern kingdom of <a>Silla</a>, the region that hitherto hosts the strongest concentration of Buddhists in South Korea. In the other states of the <a>Three Kingdoms Period</a>, <a>Goguryeo</a> and <a>Baekje</a>, it was made the state religion respectively in 372 and 528. It remained the state religion in <a>Later Silla</a> (<a>North South States Period</a>) and <a>Goryeo</a>. It was later suppressed throughout much of the subsequent history under the unified kingdom of Joseon (1392–1897), which officially adopted a strict <a>Korean Confucianism</a>. Today, South Korea has about 7 million Buddhists,<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> most of them affiliated to the <a>Jogye Order</a>. Most of the <a>National Treasures of South Korea</a> are Buddhist artifacts.

South Korea maintains diplomatic relations with more than 188 countries. The country has also been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. On 1 January 2007, former South Korean Foreign Minister <a>Ban Ki-moon</a> served as <a>UN Secretary-General</a> from 2007 to 2016. It has also developed links with the <a>Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a> as both a member of <i>ASEAN Plus three,</i> a body of observers, and the <a>East Asia Summit</a> (EAS).

</p>
<p>
In November 2009, South Korea joined the OECD <a>Development Assistance Committee</a>, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member.

</p>
<p>
South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010, a year that saw South Korea and the <a>European Union</a> conclude a <a>free trade agreement</a> (FTA) to reduce trade barriers. South Korea went on to sign a <a>Free Trade Agreement with Canada</a> and <a>Australia</a> in 2014, and another with <a>New Zealand</a> in 2015.

Both North and South Korea claim complete sovereignty over the entire peninsula and outlying islands.<sup><a href="#ref_251">[251]</a></sup> Despite mutual animosity, reconciliation efforts have continued since the initial separation between North and South Korea. Political figures such as <a>Kim Koo</a> worked to reconcile the two governments even after the Korean War.<sup><a href="#ref_252">[252]</a></sup> With longstanding animosity following the <a>Korean War</a> from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace.<sup><a href="#ref_253">[253]</a></sup> On 4 October 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader <a>Kim Jong-il</a> signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.<sup><a href="#ref_253">[253]</a></sup>

Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by <a>North Korean missile tests</a> in <a>1993</a>, <a>1998</a>, <a>2006</a>, <a>2009</a>, and <a>2013</a>. By early 2009, relationships between North and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles,<sup><a href="#ref_254">[254]</a></sup> ended its former agreements with South Korea,<sup><a href="#ref_255">[255]</a></sup> and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.<sup><a href="#ref_256">[256]</a></sup> North and South Korea are still technically at war (having never signed a peace treaty after the Korean War) and share the world's most heavily fortified border.<sup><a href="#ref_257">[257]</a></sup> On 27 May 2009, North Korean media declared that the Armistice is no longer valid because of the South Korean government's pledge to "definitely join" the <a>Proliferation Security Initiative</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_258">[258]</a></sup> To further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations, the <a>sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan</a> in March 2010 was affirmed by the South Korean government<sup><a href="#ref_259">[259]</a></sup> to have been caused by a North Korean torpedo, which the North denies. President <a>Lee Myung-bak</a> declared in May 2010 that Seoul would cut all trade with North Korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at North Korea diplomatically and financially, except for the joint Kaesong Industrial Project and humanitarian aid.<sup><a href="#ref_260">[260]</a></sup> North Korea initially threatened to sever all ties, to completely abrogate the previous pact of non-aggression, and to expel all South Koreans from <a>a joint industrial zone in Kaesong</a>, but backtracked on its threats and decided to continue its ties with South Korea. Despite the continuing ties, the Kaesong Industrial Region has seen a large decrease in investment and manpower as a result of this military conflict. In February 2016, the Kaesong complex was closed by Seoul in reaction to North Korea's launch of a rocket earlier in the month,<sup><a href="#ref_261">[261]</a></sup> which was unanimously condemned by the <a>United Nations Security Council</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_262">[262]</a></sup>
The 2017 election of President <a>Moon Jae-in</a> has seen a change in approach towards the North, and both sides used the South Korean-held <a>2018 Winter Olympics</a> as an opportunity for engagement,<sup><a href="#ref_263">[263]</a></sup> with a very senior North Korean political delegation sent to the games, along with a reciprocal visit by senior South Korean cabinet members to the North soon afterwards.<sup><a href="#ref_264">[264]</a></sup>

However, after <a>World War II</a>, the People's Republic of China embraced <a>Maoism</a> while South Korea sought close relations with the United States. The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the <a>Korean War</a>, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually and South Korea and the PRC re-established formal diplomatic relations on 24 August 1992. The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo,<sup><a href="#ref_270">[270]</a></sup> and South Korean–Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992.<sup><a href="#ref_270">[270]</a></sup> The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the <a>Republic of China (Taiwan)</a> upon gaining official relations with the People's Republic of China, which does not recognize <a>Taiwan's sovereignty</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_271">[271]</a></sup>

The 2017 deployment of <a>THAAD</a> defense missiles by the <a>United States</a> military in South Korea in response to North Korean missile tests has been protested strongly by the Chinese government, concerned that the technologically advanced missile defense could be used more broadly against China.<sup><a href="#ref_274">[274]</a></sup> Relations between the governments have cooled in response, with South Korean commercial and cultural interests in China having been targeted, and Chinese tourism to South Korea having been curtailed.<sup><a href="#ref_275">[275]</a></sup> The situation was largely resolved by South Korea making significant military concessions to China in exchange for THAAD, including not deploying any more anti-ballistic missile systems in South Korea and not participating in an alliance between the United States and Japan.<sup><a href="#ref_276">[276]</a></sup>

Korea and Japan have had <a>difficult relations since ancient times</a>, but also significant cultural exchange, with Korea acting as the gateway between Asia and Japan. Contemporary perceptions of Japan are still largely defined by <a>Japan's 35 year colonization of Korea</a> in the 20th century, which is <a>generally regarded in South Korea as having been very negative</a>. Japan is today South Korea's third largest trading partner, with 12% ($46 billion) of exports in 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_272">[272]</a></sup>

<p>
There were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan directly after independence the end of World War II in 1945. South Korea and Japan eventually signed the <a>Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea</a> in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. There is heavy <a>anti-Japanese sentiment in South Korea</a> because of a number of unsettled <a>Japanese-Korean disputes</a>, many of which stem from the period of <a>Japanese occupation</a> after the <a>Japanese annexation of Korea</a>. During <a>World War II</a>, more than 100,000 Koreans served in the <a>Imperial Japanese Army</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_280">[280]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_281">[281]</a></sup> Korean women were coerced and forced to serve the Imperial Japanese Army as sexual slaves, called <a>comfort women</a>, in both Korea and throughout the Japanese war fronts.<sup><a href="#ref_282">[282]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_283">[283]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_284">[284]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_285">[285]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>excessive citations</span></a></i>]</sup>

Longstanding issues such as <a>Japanese war crimes</a> against Korean civilians, the <a>negationist</a><a>re-writing of Japanese textbooks</a>  relating Japanese atrocities during World War II, the territorial disputes over the <a>Liancourt Rocks</a>, known in South Korea as "Dokdo" and in Japan as "Takeshima",<sup><a href="#ref_286">[286]</a></sup> and visits by Japanese politicians to the <a>Yasukuni Shrine</a>, honoring Japanese people (civilians and military) killed during the war continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations. The Liancourt Rocks were the first Korean territories to be forcibly colonized by Japan in 1905. Although it was again returned to Korea along with the rest of its territory in 1951 with the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan does not recant on its claims that the Liancourt Rocks are Japanese territory.<sup><a href="#ref_287">[287]</a></sup>
In response to then-Prime Minister <a>Junichiro Koizumi</a>'s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, former <a>President</a><a>Roh Moo-hyun</a>  suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan in 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_288">[288]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>European Union</a> (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a <a>free trade agreement</a> for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement was approved in September 2010, and took effect on 1 July 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup> South Korea is the EU's tenth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South Korea's fourth largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded €90 billion in 2015 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 9.8% between 2003 and 2013.<sup><a href="#ref_294">[294]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve this situation.<sup><a href="#ref_294">[294]</a></sup>

<p>
The close relationship began directly after <a>World War II</a>, when the United States temporarily administrated Korea for three years (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea) after Japan. Upon the onset of the <a>Korean War</a> in 1950, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South, and subsequently fought <a>as the largest contributor of UN troops</a>. The United States participation was critical for preventing the <a>near defeat of the Republic of Korea</a> by northern forces, as well as fighting back for the territory gains that define the South Korean nation today.

</p>
<p>
Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a "Mutual Defense Treaty", under which an attack on either party in the <a>Pacific area</a> would summon a response from both.<sup><a href="#ref_295">[295]</a></sup> In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the <a>Vietnam War</a>. The US has <a>over 23,000 troops stationed in South Korea</a>, including the <a>U.S. Eighth Army</a>, <a>Seventh Air Force</a>, and <a>U.S. Naval Forces Korea</a>. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.<sup><a href="#ref_296">[296]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The two nations also share a close economic relationship, with the U.S being South Korea's second largest <a>trading partner</a>, receiving $66 billion in exports in 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_272">[272]</a></sup> In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the <a>Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement</a> (KORUS FTA) was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries. On 12 October 2011, the U.S. Congress passed the long-stalled trade agreement with South Korea.<sup><a href="#ref_297">[297]</a></sup> It went into effect on 15 March 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_298">[298]</a></sup>

Unresolved tension with North Korea has prompted South Korea to allocate 2.6% of its GDP and 15% of all government spending to its military (Government share of GDP: 14.967%), while maintaining compulsory conscription for men.<sup><a href="#ref_299">[299]</a></sup> Consequently, South Korea has the world's seventh largest number of <a>active troops</a> (599,000 in 2018), the world's highest number of <a>reserve troops</a> (3,100,000 in 2018)<sup><a href="#ref_300">[300]</a></sup> and the tenth largest <a>defense budget</a>. As of 2019 South Korea has a defense budget of $43.1 billion. The South Korean military is ranked as the 6th most powerful military force in the world as of 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_301">[301]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The South Korean military consists of the <a>Army</a> (ROKA), the <a>Navy</a> (ROKN), the <a>Air Force</a> (ROKAF), and the <a>Marine Corps</a> (ROKMC), and reserve forces.<sup><a href="#ref_302">[302]</a></sup> Many of these forces are concentrated near the <a>Korean Demilitarized Zone</a>. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically 18 months. Previous exceptions for South Korean citizens of mixed race no longer apply since 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_303">[303]</a></sup>

In addition to male conscription in South Korea's sovereign military, 1,800 Korean males are selected every year to serve 18 months in the <a>KATUSA</a> Program to further augment the <a>United States Forces Korea</a> (USFK).<sup><a href="#ref_304">[304]</a></sup> In 2010, South Korea was spending <a>₩</a>1.68 trillion in a cost-sharing agreement with the US to provide budgetary support to the US forces in Korea, on top of the ₩29.6 trillion budget for its own military.

South Korea's smaller but more advanced artillery force and wide range of airborne reconnaissance platforms are pivotal in the <a>counter-battery suppression</a> of North Korea's large artillery force, which operates more than 13,000 artillery systems deployed in various state of fortification and mobility.<sup><a href="#ref_305">[305]</a></sup>

The <a>South Korean navy</a> has made its first major transformation into a <a>blue-water navy</a> through the formation of the Strategic Mobile Fleet, which includes a battle group of <a>Chungmugong Yi Sun-sin class destroyers</a>, <a>Dokdo class amphibious assault ship</a>, <a>AIP-driven</a><a>Type 214 submarines</a> , and <a>King Sejong the Great class destroyers</a>, which is equipped with the latest baseline of <a>Aegis fleet-defense</a> system that allows the ships to track and destroy multiple cruise missiles and ballistic missiles simultaneously, forming an integral part of South Korea's indigenous missile defense umbrella against the North Korean military's missile threat.<sup><a href="#ref_306">[306]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The South Korean air force operates 840 aircraft, making it world's ninth largest air force, including several types of advanced fighters like <a>F-15K</a>, heavily modified <a>KF-16C/D</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_307">[307]</a></sup> and the indigenous <a>T-50 Golden Eagle</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_308">[308]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_309">[309]</a></sup> supported by well-maintained fleets of older fighters such as <a>F-4E</a> and <a>KF-5E/F</a> that still effectively serve the air force alongside the more modern aircraft. In an attempt to gain strength in terms of not just numbers but also modernity, the commissioning of four <a>Boeing 737 AEW&C</a> aircraft, under Project Peace Eye for <a>centralized intelligence gathering and analysis</a> on a modern battlefield, will enhance the fighters' and other support aircraft's ability to perform their missions with awareness and precision.

From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years.

A fully functioning <a>UN Command</a> is at the top of the <a>chain of command</a> of all forces in South Korea, including the U.S. forces and the entire South Korean military – if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves. There has been long-term agreement between the United States and South Korea that South Korea should eventually assume the lead for its own defense.

It is a <a>developed country</a> with a <a>high-income economy</a> and is the most industrialized member country of the <a>OECD</a>. South Korean brands such as <a>LG Electronics</a> and <a>Samsung</a> are internationally famous and garnered South Korea's reputation for its quality electronics and other manufactured goods.<sup><a href="#ref_323">[323]</a></sup>

<p>
Its massive investment in education has taken the country from mass illiteracy to a major international technological powerhouse. The country's national economy benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.<sup><a href="#ref_324">[324]</a></sup> South Korea's economy was one of the world's fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and was still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, the other three <a>Asian Tigers</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_325">[325]</a></sup> It recorded  the <a>fastest rise in average GDP per capita</a> in the world between 1980 and 1990.<sup><a href="#ref_326">[326]</a></sup> South Koreans refer to this growth as the <a>Miracle on the Han River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_327">[327]</a></sup> The South Korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2014, South Korea was the <a>fifth-largest exporter</a> and <a>seventh-largest importer</a> in the world.

</p>
<p>
Despite the South Korean economy's high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on South Korean financial markets.<sup><a href="#ref_328">[328]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_329">[329]</a></sup> The <a>International Monetary Fund</a> compliments the resilience of the South Korean economy against various economic crises, citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address financial emergencies.<sup><a href="#ref_330">[330]</a></sup> Although it was severely harmed by the <a>1997 Asian financial crisis</a>, the South Korean economy managed a rapid recovery and subsequently tripled its GDP.<sup><a href="#ref_331">[331]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, South Korea was one of the few developed countries that were able to avoid a <a>recession</a> during the <a>global financial crisis</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_332">[332]</a></sup> Its economic growth rate reached 6.2 percent in 2010 (the fastest growth for eight years after significant growth by 7.2 percent in 2002),<sup><a href="#ref_333">[333]</a></sup> a sharp recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2% in 2009 during the <a>Great Recession</a>.

South Korea is not allowed to <a>enrich uranium</a> or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of US political pressure,<sup><a href="#ref_353">[353]</a></sup> unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors of South Korea in the international nuclear market. This impediment to South Korea's indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies. While South Korea is successful in exporting its electricity-generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors, it cannot capitalize on the <a>market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries</a>, preventing it from further expanding its export niche. South Korea has sought unique technologies such as <a>pyroprocessing</a> to circumvent these obstacles and seek a more advantageous competition.<sup><a href="#ref_354">[354]</a></sup> The US has recently been wary of South Korea's burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.<sup><a href="#ref_345">[345]</a></sup>

South Korean tourism is driven by many factors, including the prominence of Korean pop culture such as <a>South Korean pop music</a> and <a>television dramas</a>, known as the <a>Korean Wave</a> or (Hallyu), has gained popularity throughout East Asia. The Hyundai Research Institute reported that the Korean Wave has a direct impact in encouraging direct foreign investment back into the country through demand for products, and the tourism industry.<sup><a href="#ref_359">[359]</a></sup> Among East Asian countries, China was the most receptive, investing 1.4 billion in South Korea, with much of the investment within its service sector, a sevenfold increase from 2001. According to an analysis by economist Han Sang-Wan, a 1 percent increase in the exports of Korean cultural content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083 percent while a 1 percent increase in Korean pop content exports to a country produces a 0.019 percent bump in tourism.<sup><a href="#ref_359">[359]</a></sup>

<h3 id="South_Korean%20National%20Pension%20System">South Korean National Pension System</h3>
<p>
The <a>South Korean pension system</a> was created to provide benefits to persons reaching old age, families and persons stricken with death of their primary breadwinner, and for the purposes of stabilizing its nations welfare state.<sup><a href="#ref_360">[360]</a></sup> South Korea's pension system structure is primarily based on taxation and is income-related. In 2007 there was a total of 18,367,000 insured individuals with only around 511,000 persons excluded from mandatory contribution.<sup><a href="#ref_361">[361]</a></sup> The current pension system is divided into four categories distributing benefits to participants through national, military personnel, governmental, and private school teacher pension schemes.<sup><a href="#ref_362">[362]</a></sup> The national pension scheme is the primary welfare system providing allowances to the majority of persons. Eligibility for the national pension scheme is not dependent on income but on age and residence, where those between the ages of 18 to 59 are covered.<sup><a href="#ref_363">[363]</a></sup> Any one who is under the age of 18 are dependents of someone who is covered or under a special exclusion where they are allowed to alternative provisions.<sup><a href="#ref_364">[364]</a></sup> The national pension scheme is divided into four categories of insured persons – the workplace-based insured, the individually insured, the voluntarily insured, and the voluntarily and continuously insured.

</p>
<p>
Employees between the ages of 18 to 59 are covered under the workplace-based pension scheme and contribute 4.5% of their gross monthly earnings.<sup><a href="#ref_360">[360]</a></sup> The national pension covers employees who work in firms that employ five or more employees, fishermen, farmers, and the self-employed in both rural and urban areas. Employers are also covered under the workplace-based pension scheme and help cover their employees obligated 9% contribution by providing the remaining 4.5%.<sup><a href="#ref_364">[364]</a></sup> Anyone who is not employed, of the age of 60 or above, and excluded by article 6 of the National Pension Act<sup><a href="#ref_365">[365]</a></sup> but of the ages between 18 and 59, is covered under the individually insured pension scheme.<sup><a href="#ref_365">[365]</a></sup> Persons covered by the individually insured pension scheme are in charge of paying the entire 9% contribution themselves. Voluntarily insured persons are not subjected to mandatory coverage but can choose to be. This category comprises retirees who voluntarily choose to have additional benefits, individuals under the age of 27 without income, and individuals whose spouses are covered under a public welfare system, whether military, governmental, or private school teacher pensions.<sup><a href="#ref_363">[363]</a></sup> Like the Individually insured persons, they too are in charge of covering the full amount of the contribution. Voluntarily and continuously insured persons consists of individuals 60 years of age who want to fulfill the minimum insured period of 20 years to qualify for old age pension benefits.<sup><a href="#ref_365">[365]</a></sup> Excluding the workplace-based insured persons, all the other insured persons personally cover their own 9% contribution.<sup><a href="#ref_363">[363]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
South Korea's old-age pension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20 years of national pension coverage beforehand.<sup><a href="#ref_364">[364]</a></sup> Individuals with a minimum of 10 years covered under the national pension scheme and who are 60 years of age are able to be covered by under a 'reduced old-age pension' scheme. There also is an 'active old-age pension' scheme that covers individuals age 60 to 65 engaged in activities yielding earned income. Individuals age of 55 and younger than 60 who are not engaged in activities yielding earned income are eligible to be covered under the 'early old-age pension' scheme.<sup><a href="#ref_365">[365]</a></sup> Around 60% of all Korean elders, age 65 and over are entitled to a 5% benefit of their past average income at an average of 90,000 <a>Korean Won</a> (KRW).<sup><a href="#ref_366">[366]</a></sup> Basic old-age pension schemes covered individuals 65 years of age who earned below an amount set by presidential order. In 2010, that ceiling was 700,000 KRW for a single individual and 1,120,000 for a couple, equivalent to around $600.00 and $960.00.<sup><a href="#ref_364">[364]</a></sup>

South Korea shares its traditional culture with <a>North Korea</a>, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Historically, while the culture of Korea has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor.<sup><a href="#ref_407">[407]</a></sup> Its rich and vibrant culture left <a>21 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_408">[408]</a></sup> the <a>fourth largest in the world</a>, along with <a>15 World Heritage Sites</a>. The South Korean <a>Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism</a> actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.<sup><a href="#ref_409">[409]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The industrialization and urbanization of South Korea have brought many changes to the way modern Koreans live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-generational households separating into <a>nuclear family</a> living arrangements. A 2014 Euromonitor study found that South Koreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. South Koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average and, of the 44 other countries analyzed, Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand follow.<sup><a href="#ref_410">[410]</a></sup>

<p>
Korean art has been highly influenced by <a>Buddhism</a> and <a>Confucianism</a>, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts.<sup><a href="#ref_411">[411]</a></sup><a>Korean pottery and porcelain</a> , such as <a>Joseon</a>'s <i><a>baekja</a></i> and <a>buncheong</a>, and <a>Goryeo</a>'s <a>celadon</a> are well known throughout the world.<sup><a href="#ref_412">[412]</a></sup> The <a>Korean tea ceremony</a>, <a>pansori</a>, <a>talchum</a> and <a>buchaechum</a> are also notable Korean performing arts.

</p>
<p>
Post-war modern Korean art started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, when South Korean artists took interest in geometrical shapes and intangible subjects. Establishing a harmony between <a>man and nature</a> was also a favorite of this time. Because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s. Art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in Korea, and with it brought more diversity.<sup><a href="#ref_413">[413]</a></sup> The <a>Olympic Sculpture Garden</a> in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the <a>Whitney Biennial</a> to Seoul,<sup><a href="#ref_414">[414]</a></sup> the creation of the <a>Gwangju Biennale</a><sup><a href="#ref_415">[415]</a></sup> and the Korean Pavilion at the <a>Venice Biennale</a> in 1995<sup><a href="#ref_416">[416]</a></sup> were notable events.

<p>
Because of South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.<sup><a href="#ref_417">[417]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. Ancient architects adopted the <a>bracket system</a> characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called <i><a>ondol</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_418">[418]</a></sup> People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs with lifting eaves. Traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called <i><a>hanok</a></i>,<sup><a href="#ref_419">[419]</a></sup> and special sites like <a>Hahoe Folk Village</a>, <a>Yangdong Village of Gyeongju</a> and <a>Korean Folk Village</a>. Traditional architecture may also be seen at the nine <a>UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a> in South Korea.<sup><a href="#ref_420">[420]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Lotus_Flower_Bridge_and_Seven_Treasure_Bridge_at_Bulguksa_in_Gyeongju%2C_Korea.jpg/220px-Lotus_Flower_Bridge_and_Seven_Treasure_Bridge_at_Bulguksa_in_Gyeongju%2C_Korea.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Western architecture was first introduced to Korea at the end of the 19th century. Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles. With the <a>annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910</a> the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed. The anti-Japanese sentiment, and the Korean War, led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.<sup><a href="#ref_421">[421]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles. Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects.<sup><a href="#ref_422">[422]</a></sup> Contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of "harmony with nature" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.<sup><a href="#ref_423">[423]</a></sup>

<p>
Korean cuisine, <i>hanguk yori</i> (한국요리; 韓國料理), or <i>hansik</i> (한식; 韓食), has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The <a>Korean royal court cuisine</a> once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary Korean citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.

</p>
<p>
Korean cuisine is largely based on <a>rice</a>, <a>noodles</a>, <a>tofu</a>, vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of side dishes, <i><a>banchan</a></i> (반찬), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. <a>Kimchi</a> (김치), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known Korean dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with <a>sesame oil</a>, <i><a>doenjang</a></i> (된장), a type of <a>fermented soybean paste</a>, <a>soy sauce</a>, salt, garlic, ginger, and <i><a>gochujang</a></i> (고추장), a hot pepper paste. Other well-known dishes are <i><a>Bulgogi</a></i> (불고기), grilled marinated beef, <i><a>Gimbap</a></i> (김밥), and <i><a>Tteokbokki</a></i> (떡볶이), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.

</p>
<p>
Soups are also a common part of a Korean meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as <i><a>guk</a></i> (국) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, <i>tang</i> (탕; 湯) has less water, and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is <i><a>jjigae</a></i> (찌개), a <a>stew</a> that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.

</p>
<p>
Popular <a>Korean alcoholic beverages</a> include <a>Soju</a>, <a>Makgeolli</a> and <a>Bokbunja ju</a>.

</p>
<p>
Korea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal <a>chopsticks</a>. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.<sup><a href="#ref_424">[424]</a></sup>

In addition to domestic consumption, South Korea has a thriving entertainment industry where various facets of South Korean entertainment, including television dramas, films, and popular music, has generated significant financial revenues for the nation's economy. The cultural phenomenon known as <i><a>Hallyu</a></i> or the "Korean Wave", has swept many countries across Asia making South Korea a major soft power as an exporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling Western nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom.<sup><a href="#ref_425">[425]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_426">[426]</a></sup>

<p>
Until the 1990s, <a>trot</a> and traditional Korean <a>folk based</a> ballads dominated South Korean popular music. The emergence of the South Korean pop group <a>Seo Taiji and Boys</a> in 1992 marked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as <a>K-pop</a>, as the genre modernized itself from incorporating elements of popular musical genres from across the world such as <a>Western popular music</a>, <a>experimental</a>, <a>jazz</a>, <a>gospel</a>, <a>Latin</a>, <a>classical</a>, <a>hip hop</a>, <a>rhythm and blues</a>, <a>electronic dance</a>, <a>reggae</a>, <a>country</a>, <a>folk</a>, and <a>rock</a> on top of its uniquely <a>traditional Korean music</a> roots.<sup><a href="#ref_427">[427]</a></sup> Western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, electronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the modern South Korean popular music scene, though trot is still enjoyed among older South Koreans. K-pop stars and groups are well known across Asia and have found international fame making millions of dollars in export revenue. Many K-pop acts have also been able to secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website <a>YouTube</a>. South Korean singer <a>PSY</a> became an international sensation when his song "<a>Gangnam Style</a>" topped global music charts in 2012. 

</p>
<p>
Since the success of the film <i><a>Shiri</a></i> in 1999, the <a>Korean film</a> industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of <a>screen quotas</a> requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days a year.<sup><a href="#ref_428">[428]</a></sup> 2019's <i><a>Parasite</a></i>, directed by <a>Bong Joon-ho</a>, became the <a>highest-grossing film in South Korea</a> as well as the first non-English language film to win Best Picture at the United States-based <a>Academy Awards</a><a>that year</a>  amongst <a>numerous other accolades</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>South Korean television shows</a> have become popular outside of Korea. South Korean television dramas, known as <a>K-dramas</a>, have begun to find fame internationally. Many dramas tend to have a romantic focus, such as <i><a>Princess Hours</a></i>, <i><a>You're Beautiful</a></i>, <i><a>Playful Kiss</a></i>, <i><a>My Name is Kim Sam Soon</a></i>, <i><a>Boys Over Flowers</a></i>, <i><a>Winter Sonata</a></i>, <i><a>Autumn in My Heart</a></i>, <i><a>Full House</a></i>, <i><a>City Hunter</a></i>, <i><a>All About Eve</a></i>, <i><a>Secret Garden</a></i>, <i><a>I Can Hear Your Voice</a></i>, <i><a>Master's Sun</a></i>, <i><a>My Love from the Star</a></i>, <i><a>Healer</a></i>, <i><a>Descendants of the Sun</a></i>, <i><a>Guardian: The Lonely and Great God</a></i>, and <i><a>Crash Landing on You</a></i>. Historical dramas have included <i><a>Faith</a></i>, <i><a>Dae Jang Geum</a></i>, <i><a>The Legend</a></i>, <i><a>Dong Yi</a></i>, <i><a>Moon Embracing the Sun</a></i>, <i><a>Sungkyunkwan Scandal</a></i>, <i><a>Iljimae</a></i> and <i><a>Kingdom</a>.</i><sup><a href="#ref_429">[429]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_430">[430]</a></sup> The survival drama <i><a>Squid Game</a></i>, created by <a>Hwang Dong-hyuk</a>, received critical acclaim and widespread international attention upon its release, becoming <a>Netflix</a>'s most-watched series at launch and garnering a viewership of more than 142 million households during its first four weeks from launch.<sup><a href="#ref_431">[431]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_432">[432]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_433">[433]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_434">[434]</a></sup>

Baseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905 and has since become increasingly popular, with some sources claiming it has surpassed football as the most popular sport in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_439">[439]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_440">[440]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_441">[441]</a></sup> Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and ticket prices for professional baseball games.<sup><a href="#ref_442">[442]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_443">[443]</a></sup> The <a>Korea Professional Baseball</a> league, a 10-team circuit, was established in 1982.

Ask South Koreans when the <i>Taehan minguk</i> was established; more will answer '5000 years ago' than 'in 1948,' because to them it is simply the full name for <i>Hanguk</i>, Korea, the homeland.

The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Koguryŏ but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Koguryŏ's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Koguryŏ capital of P'yŏngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Koguryŏ commander Ŭlchi Mundŏk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'ŏngch'ŏn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Koguryŏ but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled.</q>

Soon after that, Sui China mobilized a large number of troops and launched war against Koguryŏ. However, the people of Koguryŏ were united and they were able to repel the Chinese aggressors. In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Koguryŏ forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General Ŭlchi Mundŏk of Koguryŏ completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River) with his ingenious military tactics. Only 2,700 Sui troops were able to flee from Korea. The Sui dynasty, which wasted so much energy and manpower in aggressive wars against Koguryŏ, fell in 618.</q>

Here in the relatively dangerous waters on the eastern fringes of the world, they performed the same functions as did the traders of the placid Mediterranean on the western fringes. This is a historical fact of considerable significance but one which has received virtually no attention in the standard historical compilations of that period or in the modern books based on these sources. ... While there were limits to the influence of the Koreans along the eastern coast of China, there can be no doubt of their dominance over the waters off these shores. ... The days of Korean maritime dominance in the Far East actually were numbered, but in Ennin's time the men of Silla were still the masters of the seas in their part of the world.</q>

Thus Koryŏ achieved a true national unification that embraced not only the Later Three Kingdoms but even survivors of Koguryŏ lineage from the Parhae kingdom.</q>

Even in Asia, while Central and South Asia produced a regional total of 2.8 million in human fatalities, East Asia's regional total is 10.4 million including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War">Chinese Civil War</a> (1 million), the Korean War (3 million), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War">Vietnam War</a> (2 million), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pol_Pot">Pol Pot</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide">genocide</a>  in Cambodia (1 to 2 million).</q>

A total of 36,940 Americans lost their lives in the Korean theater; of these, 33,665 were killed in action, while 3,275 died there of nonhostile causes. Some 92,134 Americans were wounded in action, and decades later, 8,176 were still reported as missing. South Korea sustained 1,312,836 casualties, including 415,004 dead. Casualties among other UN allies totaled 16,532, including 3,094 dead. Estimated North Korean casualties numbered 2 million, including about one million civilians and 520,000 soldiers. An estimated 900,000 Chinese soldiers lost their lives in combat.</q>

The North Korean and Chinese Communists never published statistics of their casualties. The number of South Korean military deaths has been given as in excess of 400,000; the South Korean Ministry of Defense puts the number of killed and missing at 281,257. Estimates of communist troops killed are about one-half million. The total number of Korean civilians who died in the fighting, which left almost every major city in North and South Korea in ruins, has been estimated at between 2 and 3 million. This adds up to almost 1 million military deaths and a possible 2.5 million civilians who were killed or died as a result of this extremely destructive conflict. The proportion of civilians killed in the major wars of this century (and not only in the major ones) has thus risen steadily. It reached about 42 percent in World War II and may have gone as high as 70 percent in the Korean War. ... we find that the ratio of civilian to military deaths [in Vietnam] is not substantially different from that of World War II and is well below that of the Korean War.</q>
