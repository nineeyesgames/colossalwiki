<p>
The <b>Channel Islands</b> (<a>Norman</a>: <i>Îles d'la Manche</i>; <a>French</a>: <i>îles Anglo-Normandes</i> or <i>îles de la Manche</i>)<sup><a href="#ref_note 1">[note 1]</a></sup> are an <a>archipelago</a> in the <a>English Channel</a>, off the French coast of <a>Normandy</a>. They include two <a>Crown Dependencies</a>: the <a>Bailiwick of Jersey</a>, which is the largest of the islands; and the <a>Bailiwick of Guernsey</a>, consisting of <a>Guernsey</a>, <a>Alderney</a>, <a>Sark</a>, <a>Herm</a> and some smaller islands. They are considered the remnants of the <a>Duchy of Normandy</a> and, although they are not part of the <a>United Kingdom</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> the UK is responsible for the defence and international relations of the islands.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> The Crown dependencies are not members of the <a>Commonwealth of Nations</a>, nor have they ever been in the <a>European Union</a>. They have a total population of about 170,499, and the bailiwicks' <a>capitals</a>, <a>Saint Helier</a> and <a>Saint Peter Port</a>, have populations of 33,500 and 18,207, respectively.

</p>
<p>
"Channel Islands" is a geographical term, not a political unit. The two <a>bailiwicks</a> have been administered separately since the late 13th century. Each has its own independent laws, elections, and representative bodies (although in modern times, politicians from the islands' legislatures are in regular contact). Any institution common to both is the exception rather than the rule.

</p>
<p>
The Bailiwick of Guernsey is divided into three jurisdictions – Guernsey, Alderney and Sark – each with its own <a>legislature</a>. Although there are a few pan-island institutions (such as the Channel Islands office to the EU in Brussels, which is actually a joint venture between the bailiwicks), these tend to be established structurally as equal projects between Guernsey and Jersey. Otherwise, entities proclaiming membership of both Guernsey and Jersey might in fact be from one bailiwick only. For instance, the <a>Channel Islands Securities Exchange</a> is in Saint Peter Port and therefore is in Guernsey.

</p>
<p>
The term "Channel Islands" began to be used around 1830, possibly first by the <a>Royal Navy</a> as a collective name for the islands.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><span>: 158 </span></sup> The term refers only to the archipelago to the west of the <a>Cotentin Peninsula</a>. Other populated islands located in the English Channel, such as <a>The Isle of Wight</a>, <a>Hayling Island</a> and <a>Portsea Island</a>, are not regarded as "Channel Islands".

The two major islands are Jersey and Guernsey. They make up 99% of the population and 92% of the area.

<h3 id="Names">Names</h3>
<p>
The names of the larger islands in the archipelago in general have the <i>-ey</i> suffix, whilst those of the smaller ones have the <i><a>-hou</a></i> suffix. These are believed to be from the <a>Old Norse</a><i>ey</i>  (island) and <i>holmr</i> (islet).

</p>
<h3 id="The_Chausey%20Islands">The Chausey Islands</h3>
<p>
The <a>Chausey</a> Islands south of Jersey are not generally included in the geographical definition of the Channel Islands but are occasionally described in English as 'French Channel Islands' in view of their French jurisdiction. They were historically linked to the Duchy of Normandy, but they are part of the French territory along with continental Normandy, and not part of the <a>British Isles</a> or of the Channel Islands in a political sense. They are an incorporated part of the commune of Granville (<a>Manche</a>). While they are popular with visitors from France, Channel Islanders can only visit them by private or charter boats as there are no direct transport links from the other islands.

</p>
<p>
In official <a>Jersey Standard French</a>, the Channel Islands are called 'Îles de la Manche', while in France, the term 'Îles Anglo-normandes' (Anglo-Norman Isles) is used to refer to the British 'Channel Islands' in contrast to other islands in the Channel. Chausey is referred to as an 'Île normande' (as opposed to <i>anglo-normande</i>). 'Îles Normandes' and 'Archipel Normand' have also, historically, been used in Channel Island French to refer to the islands as a whole.

</p>
<h3 id="Waters">Waters</h3>
<p>
The very large tidal variation provides an environmentally rich inter-tidal zone around the islands, and some islands such as <a>Burhou</a>, the <a>Écréhous</a>, and the <a>Minquiers</a> have been designated <a>Ramsar sites</a>.

</p>
<p>
The waters around the islands include the following:

<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swinge">The Swinge</a> (between Alderney and Burhou)</li><li>The Little Swinge (between Burhou and Les Nannels)</li><li>La Déroute (between Jersey and Sark, and Jersey and the Cotentin)</li><li>Le Raz Blanchard, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alderney_Race">Race of Alderney</a> (between Alderney and the Cotentin)</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Russel">Great Russel</a> (between Sark, Jéthou and Herm)</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Russel">Little Russel</a> (between Guernsey, Herm and Jéthou)</li><li>Souachehouais (between Le Rigdon and L'Étacq, Jersey)</li><li>Le Gouliot (between Sark and Brecqhou)</li><li>La Percée (between Herm and Jéthou)</li></ul>
<h3 id="Highest_point">Highest point</h3>
<p>
The highest point in the islands is <a>Les Platons</a> in Jersey at 143 metres (469 ft) above sea level. The lowest point is the English Channel (sea level).

<h3 id="Prehistory">Prehistory</h3>
<p>
The earliest evidence of human occupation of the Channel Islands has been dated to 250,000 years ago when they were attached to the landmass of continental Europe.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The islands became detached by <a>rising sea levels</a> in the Neolithic period. The numerous <a>dolmens</a> and other archaeological sites extant and recorded in history demonstrate the existence of a population large enough and organised enough to undertake constructions of considerable size and sophistication, such as the burial mound at <a>La Hougue Bie</a><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> in Jersey or the <a>statue menhirs</a> of Guernsey.

</p>
<h3 id="From_the%20Iron%20Age">From the Iron Age</h3>
<p>
Hoards of <a>Armorican</a> coins have been excavated, providing evidence of trade and contact in the <a>Iron Age</a> period. Evidence for Roman settlement is sparse, although evidently the islands were visited by Roman officials and traders. The Roman name for the Channel Islands was <i>I. Lenuri</i> (Lenur Islands) and is included in the <a>Peutinger Table</a><sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><span>: 4 </span></sup> The traditional Latin names used for the islands (Caesarea for Jersey, Sarnia for Guernsey, Riduna for Alderney) derive (possibly mistakenly) from the <a>Antonine Itinerary</a>. Gallo-Roman culture was adopted to an unknown extent in the islands.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the sixth century, Christian missionaries visited the islands. <a>Samson of Dol</a>, <a>Helier</a>, <a>Marculf</a> and <a>Magloire</a> are among saints associated with the islands. In the sixth century, they were already included in the <a>diocese of Coutances</a> where they remained until the Reformation.

</p>
<p>
There were probably some <a>Celtic Britons</a> who settled on the Islands in the 5th and 6th centuries AD (the indigenous Celts of <a>Great Britain</a>, and the ancestors of the modern <a>Welsh</a>, <a>Cornish</a>, and <a>Bretons</a>) who had emigrated from Great Britain in the face of invading <a>Anglo-Saxons</a>. But there were not enough of them to leave any trace, and the islands continued to be ruled by the king of the Franks and its church remained part of the <a>diocese of Coutances</a>.

</p>
<p>
From the beginning of the ninth century, <a>Norse</a><a>raiders</a>  appeared on the coasts. Norse settlement eventually succeeded initial attacks, and it is from this period that many place names of Norse origin appear, including the modern names of the islands.

</p>
<h3 id="From_the%20Duchy%20of%20Normandy">From the Duchy of Normandy</h3>
<p>
In 933, the islands were granted to <a>William I Longsword</a> by <a>Raoul</a><a>King of Western Francia</a><sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>  and annexed to the <a>Duchy of Normandy</a>. In 1066, <a>William II of Normandy</a> invaded and conquered England, becoming William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. In the period 1204–1214, <a>King John</a> lost the <a>Angevin lands</a> in northern France, including mainland Normandy, to <a>King Philip II of France</a>, but managed to retain control of the Channel Islands. In 1259, his successor, <a>Henry III of England</a>, by the <a>Treaty of Paris</a>, officially surrendered his claim and title to the Duchy of Normandy, while the King of France gave up claim to the Channel Islands, which was based upon his position as feudal overlord of the Duke of Normandy. Since then, the Channel Islands have been governed as possessions of <a>the Crown</a> and were never absorbed into the <a>Kingdom of England</a> and its successor kingdoms of Great Britain and the United Kingdom.

</p>
<p>
The islands were invaded by the French in 1338, who held some territory until 1345. <a>Edward III of England</a> granted a Charter in July 1341 to Jersey, Guernsey, Sark and Alderney, confirming their customs and laws to secure allegiance to the English Crown.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><span>: 2–4 </span></sup><a>Owain Lawgoch</a> , a mercenary leader of a <a>Free Company</a> in the service of the French Crown, attacked Jersey and Guernsey in 1372, and in 1373 <a>Bertrand du Guesclin</a> besieged <a>Mont Orgueil</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> The young King <a>Richard II of England</a> reconfirmed in 1378 the Charter rights granted by his grandfather, followed in 1394 with a second Charter granting, because of great loyalty shown to the Crown, exemption for ever, from English tolls, customs and duties.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><span>: 5–10 </span></sup> Jersey was occupied by the French in 1461 as part of an exchange of helping the Lancastrians fight against the Yorkists during <a>The War of the Roses</a>. It was retaken by the Yorkists in 1468. In 1483 a <a>Papal bull</a> decreed that the islands would be neutral during time of war. This privilege of neutrality enabled islanders to trade with both France and England and was respected until 1689 when it was abolished by <a>Order in Council</a> following the <a>Glorious Revolution</a> in Great Britain.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Various attempts to transfer the islands from the diocese of Coutances (to Nantes (1400), Salisbury (1496), and Winchester (1499)) had little effect until an Order in Council of 1569 brought the islands formally into the <a>diocese of Winchester</a>. Control by the bishop of Winchester was ineffectual as the islands had turned overwhelmingly <a>Calvinist</a> and the episcopacy was not restored until 1620 in Jersey and 1663 in Guernsey.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Sark in the 16th century was uninhabited until colonised from Jersey in the 1560s. The grant of <a>seigneurship</a> from <a>Elizabeth I of England</a> in 1565 forms the basis of Sark's constitution today.

</p>
<h3 id="From_the%20seventeenth%20century">From the seventeenth century</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Islands_in_the_Wars_of_the_Three_Kingdoms">Channel Islands in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a></div>
<p>
During the <a>Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a>, Jersey held out strongly for the Royalist cause, providing refuge for <a>Charles, Prince of Wales</a> in 1646 and 1649–1650, while the more strongly <a>Presbyterian</a> Guernsey more generally favoured the parliamentary cause (although <a>Castle Cornet</a> was held by Royalists and did not surrender until October 1651).<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The islands acquired commercial and political interests in the North American colonies. Islanders became involved with the <a>Newfoundland</a> fisheries in the seventeenth century. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, <a>Charles II</a> gave <a>George Carteret</a>, Bailiff and governor, a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he promptly named <a>New Jersey</a>, now part of the United States of America.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup><a>Sir Edmund Andros</a>  of Guernsey was an early colonial governor in North America, and head of the short-lived <a>Dominion of New England</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the late eighteenth century, the Islands were dubbed "the French Isles". Wealthy French émigrés fleeing the <a>Revolution</a> sought residency in the islands. Many of the town domiciles existing today were built in that time. In <a>Saint Peter Port</a>, a large part of the harbour had been built by 1865.

<p>
The islands were the only part of the <a>British Isles</a> to be occupied by the <a>German Army</a> during <a>World War II</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>British Government</a> demilitarised the islands in June 1940, and the lieutenant-governors were withdrawn on 21 June, leaving the insular administrations to continue government as best they could under impending military occupation.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Before German troops landed, between 30 June and 4 July 1940, evacuation took place. Many young men had already left to join the Allied armed forces, as volunteers. 6,600 out of 50,000 left Jersey while 17,000 out of 42,000 left Guernsey.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Thousands of children were evacuated with their schools to <a>England</a> and <a>Scotland</a>.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Channel_Islands_Liberated-_the_End_of_German_Occupation%2C_Channel_Islands%2C_UK%2C_1945_D24599.jpg/170px-Channel_Islands_Liberated-_the_End_of_German_Occupation%2C_Channel_Islands%2C_UK%2C_1945_D24599.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The population of Sark largely remained where they were;<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> but in <a>Alderney</a>, all but six people left. In Alderney, the occupying Germans built <a>four camps</a> in which over 700 people out of a total worker population of about 6,000 died. Due to the destruction of documents, it is impossible to state how many forced workers died in the other islands.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Alderney had the only Nazi concentration camps on <a>British</a> soil.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Royal Navy</a><a>blockaded</a>  the islands from time to time, particularly following the <a>Invasion of Normandy</a> in June 1944. There was considerable hunger and privation during the five years of German occupation, particularly in the final months when the population was close to starvation. Intense negotiations resulted in some humanitarian aid being sent via the <a>Red Cross</a>, leading to the arrival of <a>Red Cross parcels</a> in the supply ship <a>SS Vega</a> in December 1944.

</p>
<p>
The German occupation of 1940–45 was harsh: over 2,000 Islanders were deported by the Germans,<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> some Jews were sent to <a>concentration camps</a>; <a>partisan</a> resistance and retribution, accusations of <a>collaboration</a>, and slave labour also occurred. Many Spaniards, initially refugees from the <a>Spanish Civil War</a>, were brought to the islands to build <a>fortifications</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Later, <a>Russians</a> and <a>Central Europeans</a><sup>[<i><a><span>who?</span></a></i>]</sup> continued the work.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Many <a>land mines</a> were laid, with 65,718 land mines laid in Jersey alone.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There was no <a>resistance movement</a> in the Channel Islands on the scale of that in <a>mainland France</a>. This has been ascribed to a range of factors including the physical separation of the Islands, the density of troops (up to one German for every two Islanders), the small size of the Islands precluding any hiding places for <a>resistance</a> groups, and the absence of the <a>Gestapo</a> from the occupying forces. Moreover, much of the population of military age had joined the British Army already.

</p>
<p>
The end of the occupation came after <a>VE-Day</a> on 8 May 1945, Jersey and Guernsey being liberated on 9 May. The German garrison in Alderney was left until 16 May, and it was one of the last of the <a>Nazi German</a> remnants to surrender.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The first evacuees returned on the first sailing from Great Britain on 23 June,<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> but the people of Alderney were unable to start returning until December 1945. Many of the evacuees who returned home had difficulty reconnecting with their families after five years of separation.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Following the liberation of 1945, reconstruction led to a transformation of the economies of the islands, attracting immigration and developing tourism. The legislatures were reformed and non-party governments embarked on social programmes, aided by the incomes from <a>offshore finance</a>, which grew rapidly from the 1960s.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The islands decided not to join the <a>European Economic Community</a> when the UK joined, and remain outside.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> Since the 1990s, declining profitability of agriculture and tourism has challenged the governments of the islands.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>

The Channel Islands fall into two separate <a>self-governing</a><a>bailiwicks</a> , the <a>Bailiwick of Guernsey</a> and the <a>Bailiwick of Jersey</a>. Both are <a>British</a><a>Crown dependencies</a> , and neither is a part of the United Kingdom. They have been parts of the <a>Duchy of Normandy</a> since the tenth century, and <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> is often referred to by her traditional and conventional title of <a>Duke of Normandy</a>. However, pursuant to the <a>Treaty of Paris (1259)</a>, she governs in her right as The Queen (the "Crown in right of Jersey",<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> and the "Crown in right of the <i>république</i> of the Bailiwick of Guernsey"),<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> and not as the Duke. This notwithstanding, it is a matter of local pride for monarchists to treat the situation otherwise: the <a>Loyal toast</a> at formal dinners is to 'The Queen, our Duke', rather than to 'Her Majesty, The Queen' as in the UK.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A bailiwick is a territory administered by a bailiff. Although the words derive from a common root ('bail' = 'to give charge of') there is a vast difference between the meanings of the word 'bailiff' in Great Britain and in the Channel Islands; a bailiff in Britain is a court-appointed private debt-collector authorised to collect judgment debts, in the Channel Islands, the <a>Bailiff</a> in each bailiwick is the civil head, presiding officer of the States, and also head of the <a>judiciary</a>, and thus the most important citizen in the bailiwick.

In the early 21st century, the existence of governmental offices such as the bailiffs' with multiple roles straddling the different branches of government came under increased scrutiny for their apparent contravention of the doctrine of separation of powers—most notably in the Guernsey case of <i>McGonnell -v- United Kingdom</i> (2000) 30 EHRR 289. That case, following final judgement at the European Court of Human Rights, became part of the impetus for much recent constitutional change, particularly the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (2005 c.4) in the UK, including the separation of the roles of the Lord Chancellor, the abolition of the House of Lords' judicial role, and its replacement by the <a>UK Supreme Court</a>. The islands' bailiffs, however, still retain their historic roles.

</p>
<p>
The systems of government in the islands date from <a>Norman</a> times, which accounts for the names of the legislatures, the States, derived from the <a>Norman</a> 'États' or '<a>estates</a>' (i.e. the Crown, the Church, and the people). The States have evolved over the centuries into democratic parliaments.

</p>

<p>
The UK Parliament has power to legislate for the islands, but Acts of Parliament do not extend to the islands automatically. Usually, an Act gives power to extend its application to the islands by an <a>Order in Council</a>, after consultation. For the most part the islands legislate for themselves.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> Each island has its own primary legislature, known as the <a>States of Guernsey</a> and the <a>States of Jersey</a>, with Chief Pleas in Sark and the <a>States of Alderney</a>. The Channel Islands are not represented in the <a>UK Parliament</a>. Laws passed by the States are given <a>royal assent</a> by <a>The Queen in Council</a>, to whom the islands' governments are responsible.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The islands have never been part of the <a>European Union</a>, and thus were not a party to the 2016 <a>referendum</a> on the <a>EU</a> membership, but were part of the Customs Territory of the <a>European Community</a> by virtue of Protocol Three to the <a>Treaty on European Union</a>. In September 2010, a Channel Islands Brussels Office was set up jointly by the two Bailiwicks to develop the Channel Islands' influence with the EU, to advise the Channel Islands' governments on European matters, and to promote economic links with the EU.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Both bailiwicks are members of the <a>British–Irish Council</a>, and <a>Jèrriais</a> and <a>Guernésiais</a> are recognised <a>regional languages</a> of the islands.

</p>
<p>
The legal courts are separate; separate courts of appeal have been in place since 1961. Among the legal heritage from Norman law is the <a>Clameur de haro</a>. The basis of the legal systems of both Bailiwicks is Norman customary law (<a>Coutume</a>) rather than the English <a>Common Law</a>, although elements of the latter have become established over time.

</p>
<p>
Islanders are full British citizens, but were not classed as European citizens unless by descent from a UK national. Any British citizen who applies for a passport in Jersey or Guernsey receives a passport bearing the words "<a>British Islands</a>, Bailiwick of Jersey" or "British Islands, Bailiwick of Guernsey". Under the provisions of Protocol Three, Channel Islanders who do not have a close connection with the UK (no parent or grandparent from the UK, and have never been resident in the UK for a five-year period) did not automatically benefit from the EU provisions on free movement within the EU, and their passports received an endorsement to that effect. This affected only a minority of islanders.

</p>
<p>
Under the UK <a>Interpretation Act 1978</a>, the Channel Islands are deemed to be part of the British Islands,<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> not to be confused with the <a>British Isles</a>. For the purposes of the <a>British Nationality Act 1981</a>, the "British Islands" include the United Kingdom (Great Britain and Northern Ireland), the Channel Islands and the <a>Isle of Man</a>, taken together, unless the context otherwise requires.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>

<p>
Tourism is still important. However, Jersey and Guernsey have, since the 1960s, become major <a>offshore financial centres</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> Historically Guernsey's horticultural and greenhouse activities have been more significant than in Jersey, and Guernsey has maintained <a>light industry</a> as a higher proportion of its economy than Jersey. In Jersey, potatoes are an important export crop, shipped mostly to the UK.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Jersey is heavily reliant on financial services, with 39.4% of Gross Value Added (GVA) in 2018 contributed by the sector. Rental income comes second at 15.1% with other business activities at 11.2%. Tourism 4.5% with agriculture contributing just 1.2% and manufacturing even lower at 1.1%. GVA has fluctuated between £4.5 and £5 billion for 20 years.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Jersey has had a steadily rising population, increasing from below 90,000 in 2000 to over 105,000 in 2018 which combined with a flat GVA has resulted in GVA per head of population falling from £57,000 to £44,000 per person.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> Guernsey had a GDP of £3.2 billion in 2018<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> and with a stable population of around 66,000 has had a steadily rising GDP, and a GVA per head of population which in 2018 surpassed £52,000.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Both bailiwicks issue their own banknotes and coins, which circulate freely in all the islands alongside UK coinage and Bank of England and Scottish banknotes.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>

Since 1969, Jersey and Guernsey have operated postal administrations independently of the UK's <a>Royal Mail</a>, with their own postage stamps, which can be used for postage only in their respective Bailiwicks. UK stamps are no longer valid, but mail to the islands, and to the <a>Isle of Man</a>, is charged at UK inland rates. It was not until the early 1990s that the islands joined the <a>UK's postcode</a> system, Jersey postcodes using the initials JE and Guernsey GY.

Each of the three largest islands has a distinct vehicle registration scheme:

</p>
<ul><li>Guernsey (GBG): a number of up to five digits;</li><li>Jersey (GBJ): <i>J</i> followed by up to six digits (<i>JSY</i> vanity plates are also issued);</li><li>Alderney (GBA): <i>AY</i> followed by up to five digits (four digits are the most that have been used, as redundant numbers are re-issued).</li></ul>
<p>
In <a>Sark</a>, where most motor traffic is prohibited, the few vehicles – nearly all tractors – do not display plates. Bicycles display tax discs.

</p>
<p>
In the 1960s, names used for the cross-Channel ferries plying the mail route between the islands and <a>Weymouth</a>, Dorset, were taken from the popular Latin names for the islands: <i>Caesarea</i> (Jersey), <i>Sarnia</i> (Guernsey) and <i>Riduna</i> (Alderney). Fifty years later, the ferry route between the Channel Islands and the UK is operated by <a>Condor Ferries</a> from both St Helier, Jersey and St Peter Port, Guernsey, using high-speed catamaran fast craft to <a>Poole</a> in the UK. A regular passenger ferry service on the Commodore Clipper goes from both Channel Island ports to <a>Portsmouth</a> daily, and carries both passengers and freight.

</p>
<p>
Ferry services to Normandy are operated by Manche Îles Express, and services between Jersey and <a>Saint-Malo</a> are operated by Compagnie Corsaire and Condor Ferries.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Sark Shipping Company operates small ferries to Sark.

On 20 August 2013, <a>Huelin-Renouf</a>, which had operated a "lift-on lift-off" container service for 80 years between the <a>Port of Southampton</a> and the Port of <a>Jersey</a>, ceased trading.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Senator <a>Alan Maclean</a>, a Jersey politician, had previously tried to save the 90-odd jobs furnished by the company to no avail.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> On 20 September, it was announced that <a>Channel Island Lines</a> would continue this service, and would purchase the MV <a>Huelin Dispatch</a> from <a>Associated British Ports</a> who in turn had purchased them from the receiver in the bankruptcy.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> The new operator was to be funded by <a>Rockayne Limited</a>, a closely held association of Jersey businesspeople.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>

There are three airports in the Channel Islands; <a>Alderney Airport</a>, <a>Guernsey Airport</a> and <a>Jersey Airport</a>, which are directly connected to each other by services operated by <a>Blue Islands</a> and <a>Aurigny</a>.

</p>
<p>
Historically there have been railway networks on Jersey, Guernsey, and Alderney, but all of the lines on Jersey and Guernsey have been closed and dismantled. Today there are three working railways in the Channel Islands, of which the <a>Alderney Railway</a> is the only one providing a regular timetabled passenger service. The other two are a <span><span>7<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>4</span></span> in</span> (<span>184 mm</span>) gauge miniature railway, also on Alderney, and the heritage steam railway operated on Jersey as part of the <a>Pallot Heritage Steam Museum</a>.

<h3 id="Media">Media</h3>
<p>
The Channel Islands are served by a number of local radio services - <a>BBC Radio Jersey</a> and <a>Radio Guernsey</a>, <a>Channel 103</a> and <a>Island FM</a> - as well as regional television news opt-outs from <a>BBC Channel Islands</a> and <a>ITV Channel Television</a>.

</p>
<p>
On 1 August 2021, DAB+ digital radio became available for the first time, introducing new stations like the local Bailiwick Radio and <a>Soleil Radio</a>, and UK-wide services like <a>Capital</a>, <a>Heart</a>, and <a>Times Radio</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are two broadcast transmitters serving Jersey - at <a>Frémont Point</a> and Les Platons - as well as one at Les Touillets in Guernsey and a relay in Alderney.

Jersey always operated its own telephone services independently of Britain's national system, Guernsey established its own telephone service in 1968. Both islands still form part of the <a>British telephone numbering plan</a>, but <a>Ofcom</a> on the mainlines does not have responsibility for telecommunications regulatory and licensing issues on the islands. It is responsible for wireless telegraphy licensing throughout the islands, and by agreement, for broadcasting regulation in the two large islands only. Submarine cables connect the various islands and provide connectivity with England and France.

<h3 id="Internet">Internet</h3>
<p>
Modern broadband speeds are available in all the islands, including full-fibre (<a>FTTH</a>) in Jersey (offering speeds of up to 1Gbps on all broadband connections) and <a>VDSL</a> and some business fibre connectivity in Guernsey. Providers include <a>Sure</a> and <a>JT</a>.

The <a>Norman language</a> predominated in the islands until the nineteenth century, when increasing influence from English-speaking settlers and easier transport links led to Anglicisation.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> There are four main dialects/languages of Norman in the islands, <a>Auregnais</a> (Alderney, extinct in late twentieth century), <a>Dgèrnésiais</a> (Guernsey), <a>Jèrriais</a> (Jersey) and <a>Sercquiais</a> (Sark, an offshoot of Jèrriais).<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>

<a>Victor Hugo</a> spent many years in exile, first in Jersey and then in Guernsey, where he finished <i><a>Les Misérables</a></i>. Guernsey is the setting of Hugo's later novel <i>Les Travailleurs de la Mer</i> (<i><a>Toilers of the Sea</a></i>).<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> A "Guernsey-man" also makes an appearance in chapter 91 of <a>Herman Melville</a>'s <i><a>Moby-Dick</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The annual "<a>Muratti</a>", the inter-island <a>football</a> match, is considered the sporting event of the year, although, due to broadcast coverage, it no longer attracts the crowds of spectators, travelling between the islands, that it did during the twentieth century.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Cricket</a> is popular in the Channel Islands. The <a>Jersey cricket team</a> and the <a>Guernsey cricket team</a> are both associate members of the <a>International Cricket Council</a>. The teams have played each other in the <a>inter-insular match</a> since 1957. In 2001 and 2002, the Channel Islands entered a team into the <a>MCCA Knockout Trophy</a>, the one-day tournament of the <a>minor counties of English and Welsh cricket</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>

Christianity was brought to the islands around the sixth century; according to tradition, Jersey was evangelised by St <a>Helier</a>, Guernsey by St <a>Samson of Dol</a>, and the smaller islands were occupied at various times by monastic communities representing strands of <a>Celtic Christianity</a>. At the <a>Reformation</a>, the previously <a>Roman Catholic</a> islands converted to <a>Calvinism</a> under the influence of an influx of French-language pamphlets published in <a>Geneva</a>. <a>Anglicanism</a> was imposed in the seventeenth century, but the Non-Conformist local tendency returned with a strong adoption of <a>Methodism</a>. In the late twentieth century, a strong Roman Catholic presence re-emerged with the arrival of numerous Portuguese workers (both from mainland <a>Portugal</a> and the island of <a>Madeira</a>). Their numbers have been reinforced by recent migrants from Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Today, <a>Evangelical</a> churches have been established. Services are held in a number of languages.

According to 2015 statistics, 39% of the population was non-religious.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
