<b>Scotland</b> (<a>Scots</a>: <i>Scotland</i>, <a>Scottish Gaelic</a>: <i><a>Alba</a></i><small></small><span><a>[ˈal̪ˠapə]</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span>  ) is a <a>country</a> that is part of the <a>United Kingdom</a>. Covering the northern third of the island of <a>Great Britain</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><a>mainland</a>  Scotland has a 96-mile (154 km) <a>border</a> with <a>England</a> to the southeast and is otherwise surrounded by the <a>Atlantic Ocean</a> to the north and west, the <a>North Sea</a> to the northeast and the <a>Irish Sea</a> to the south. The country also contains more than 790 islands,<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> principally in the <a>archipelagos</a> of the <a>Hebrides</a> and the <a>Northern Isles</a>. Most of the population, including the capital <a>Edinburgh</a>, is concentrated in the <a>Central Belt</a> – the plain between the <a>Scottish Highlands</a> and the <a>Southern Uplands</a> – in the <a>Scottish Lowlands</a>.

</p>
<p>
Scotland is divided into 32 <a>administrative subdivisions</a> or local authorities, known as council areas.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup><a>Glasgow City</a>  is the largest council area in terms of population, with <a>Highland</a> being the largest in terms of area. Limited self-governing power, covering matters such as education, social services and roads and transportation, is devolved from the Scottish Government to each subdivision.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> Scotland is the second largest country in the United Kingdom, and accounted for 8.3% of the population in 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Kingdom of Scotland</a> emerged as an independent <a>sovereign state</a> in the <a>Early Middle Ages</a> and continued to exist until 1707. By inheritance in 1603, <a>James VI of Scotland</a> became king of <a>England</a> and <a>Ireland</a>, thus forming a <a>personal union</a> of the <a>three kingdoms</a>. Scotland subsequently entered into a <a>political union</a> with the Kingdom of England on 1 May 1707 to create the new <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The union also created the <a>Parliament of Great Britain</a>, which succeeded both the <a>Parliament of Scotland</a> and the <a>Parliament of England</a>. In 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain entered into a political union with the Kingdom of Ireland to create the <a>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> (in 1922, the <a>Irish Free State</a> seceded from the United Kingdom, leading to the latter being <a>officially renamed</a> the United Kingdom of Great Britain and <a>Northern Ireland</a> in 1927).<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Within Scotland, the <a>monarchy of the United Kingdom</a> has continued to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to the pre-union Kingdom of Scotland. The <a>legal system within Scotland</a> has also remained separate from those of <a>England and Wales</a> and <a>Northern Ireland</a>; Scotland constitutes a distinct jurisdiction in both public and private law.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> The continued existence of legal, <a>educational</a>, <a>religious</a> and other institutions distinct from those in the remainder of the UK have all contributed to the continuation of <a>Scottish culture</a> and <a>national identity</a> since the 1707 <a>incorporating</a> union with England.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1999, a <a>Scottish Parliament</a> was re-established, in the form of a <a>devolved</a><a>unicameral legislature</a>  comprising 129 <a>members</a>, having authority over many areas of <a>domestic policy</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> The head of the <a>Scottish Government</a> is the <a>first minister of Scotland</a>, who is supported by the <a>deputy first minister of Scotland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> Scotland is represented in the <a>United Kingdom Parliament</a> by 59 <a>MPs</a>. Scotland is also a member of the <a>British–Irish Council</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> sending five members of the Scottish Parliament to the <a>British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> as well as being part of the <a>Joint Ministerial Committee</a>, represented by the first minister.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>
<i>Scotland</i> comes from <i><a>Scoti</a></i>, the Latin name for the <a>Gaels</a>. <a>Philip Freeman</a> has speculated on the likelihood of a group of raiders adopting a name from an <a>Indo-European root</a>, *<i>skot</i>, citing the parallel in Greek <i>skotos</i> (σκότος), meaning "darkness, gloom".<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> The <a>Late Latin</a> word <i><a>Scotia</a></i> ("land of the Gaels") was initially used to refer to Ireland,<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> and likewise in early <a>Old English</a><i>Scotland</i>  was used for Ireland.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> By the 11th century at the latest, <i>Scotia</i> was being used to refer to (Gaelic-speaking) Scotland north of the <a>River Forth</a>, alongside <i>Albania</i> or <i>Albany</i>, both derived from the Gaelic <i><a>Alba</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> The use of the words <i>Scots</i> and <i>Scotland</i> to encompass all of what is now Scotland became common in the <a>Late Middle Ages</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>

Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of human habitation that may have existed before the <a>Mesolithic period</a>. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of <a>hunter-gatherers</a> arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the <a>last glaciation</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> At the time, Scotland was covered in forests, had more bog-land, and the main form of transport was by water.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 9 </span></sup> These settlers began building the first known permanent houses on Scottish soil around 9,500 years ago, and the first villages around 6,000 years ago. The well-preserved village of <a>Skara Brae</a> on the mainland of <a>Orkney</a> dates from this period. <a>Neolithic</a> habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the <a>Northern Isles</a> and <a>Western Isles</a>, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the <a>Callanish Stones</a> on <a>Lewis</a> and the <a>Maes Howe</a> on Orkney, which were built in the third millennium BC.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><span>: 38 </span></sup>

<p>
The first written reference to Scotland was in 320 BC by Greek sailor <a>Pytheas</a>, who called the northern tip of Britain "Orcas", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 10 </span></sup> During the first millennium BC, the society changed dramatically to a chiefdom model, as consolidation of settlement led to the concentration of wealth and underground stores of surplus food.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 11 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Roman conquest of Britain</a> was never completed, and most of modern Scotland was not brought under Roman political control.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> The first Roman incursion into Scotland occurred in 79 AD, when <a>Agricola</a> invaded Scotland; he defeated a Caledonian army at the <a>Battle of Mons Graupius</a> in 83 AD.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 12 </span></sup> After the Roman victory, Roman forts were briefly set along the <a>Gask Ridge</a> close to the <a>Highland line</a>, but by three years after the battle, the Roman armies had withdrawn to the <a>Southern Uplands</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Remains of Roman forts established in the 1st century have been found as far north as the <a>Moray Firth</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> By the reign of the <a>Roman emperor</a><a>Trajan</a>  (<span><abbr>r</abbr>. 98–117</span>), Roman control had lapsed to Britain south of a line between the <a>River Tyne</a> and the <a>Solway Firth</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> Along this line Trajan's successor <a>Hadrian</a> (<span><abbr>r</abbr>. 117–138</span>) erected <a>Hadrian's Wall</a> in northern England<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 12 </span></sup> and the <i><a>Limes Britannicus</a></i> became the northern border of the Roman Empire.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> The Roman influence on the southern part of the country was considerable, and they introduced <a>Christianity</a> to Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 13–14 </span></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><span>: 38 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Antonine Wall</a> was built from 142 at the order of Hadrian's successor <a>Antoninus Pius</a> (<span><abbr>r</abbr>. 138–161</span>), defending the Roman part of Scotland from the unadministered part of the island, north of a line between the <a>Firth of Clyde</a> and the <a>Firth of Forth</a>. The successful <a>Roman invasion of Caledonia 208–210</a> was undertaken by emperors of the imperial <a>Severan dynasty</a> in response to the breaking of treaty by the Caledonians in 197,<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> but permanent conquest of the whole of Great Britain was forestalled by the death of the senior emperor <a>Septimius Severus</a> (<span><abbr>r</abbr>. 193–211</span>) while on campaign at <a>Eboracum</a> (<a>York</a>), and the Caledonians were again in revolt in 210–211.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> Forts erected by the <a>Roman army</a> of the Severan campaign were placed near those established by Agricola and were clustered at the mouths of the <a>glens</a> in the Highlands.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
To the Roman historians <a>Tacitus</a> and <a>Cassius Dio</a>, the <a>Scottish Highlands</a> and the area north of the <a>River Forth</a> was called <a>Caledonia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> According to Cassius Dio, the inhabitants of Caledonia were the <a>Caledonians</a> and the <a>Maeatae</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> Other ancient authors used the adjective "Caledonian" to pertain to anywhere in northern or inland Britain, often mentioning the region's people and animals, its cold climate, its pearls, and a noteworthy region of wooden hills (<a>Latin</a>: <i>saltus</i>) which the 2nd-century AD Roman philosopher <a>Ptolemy</a>, in his <a><i>Geography</i></a>, described as being south-west of the <a>Beauly Firth</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> The name Caledonia is echoed in the place names of <a>Dunkeld</a>, <a>Rohallion</a>, and <a>Schiehallion</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Great Conspiracy</a> against Roman rule in Britain in the later 4th century, in which the <a>Scoti</a> participated, was defeated by the <a><i>comes</i> Theodosius</a>. The formation of a new province, called <a>Valentia</a> after the reigning emperor <a>Valens</a> (<span><abbr>r</abbr>. 364–378</span>), which may have been in Scotland, resulted.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> Roman military government was withdrawn from the island altogether by the early 5th century, resulting in the <a>Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain</a> and the immigration of the <a>Saxons</a> to southern Scotland and the rest of eastern Great Britain.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>

<p>
Beginning in the sixth century, the area that is now Scotland was divided into three areas: <a>Pictland</a>, a patchwork of small lordships in central Scotland;<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 25–26 </span></sup> the <a>Anglo-Saxon</a><a>Kingdom of Northumbria</a> , which had conquered southeastern Scotland;<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 18–20 </span></sup> and <a>Dál Riata</a>, founded by settlers from Ireland, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 20 </span></sup> These societies were based on the family unit and had sharp divisions in wealth, although the vast majority were poor and worked full-time in <a>subsistence agriculture</a>. The Picts kept slaves (mostly captured in war) through the ninth century.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 26–27 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
Gaelic influence over Pictland and Northumbria was facilitated by the large number of <a>Gaelic-speaking clerics</a> working as missionaries.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 23–24 </span></sup> Operating in the sixth century on the island of <a>Iona</a>, <a>Saint Columba</a> was one of the earliest and best-known missionaries.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><span>: 39 </span></sup> The <a>Vikings</a> began to raid Scotland in the eighth century. Although the raiders sought slaves and luxury items, their main motivation was to acquire land. The oldest Norse settlements were in northwest Scotland, but they eventually conquered many areas along the coast. <a>Old Norse</a> entirely displaced Gaelic in the <a>Northern Isles</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 29–30 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the ninth century, the Norse threat allowed a Gael named <a>Cináed mac Ailpín</a> (Kenneth I) to seize power over Pictland, establishing a royal dynasty to which the modern monarchs trace their lineage, and marking the beginning of the end of Pictish culture.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 31–32 </span></sup><sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> The kingdom of Cináed and his descendants, called Alba, was Gaelic in character but existed on the same area as Pictland. By the end of the tenth century, the <a>Pictish language</a> went extinct as its speakers shifted to Gaelic.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 32–33 </span></sup> From a base in eastern Scotland north of the <a>River Forth</a> and south of the <a>River Spey</a>, the kingdom expanded first southwards, into the former Northumbrian lands, and northwards into <a>Moray</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 34–35 </span></sup> Around the turn of the millennium, there was a centralization in agricultural lands and the first towns began to be established.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><span>: 36–37 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, with much of Scotland under the control of a single ruler and united by the Gaelic language, a modern <a>nation-state</a> first emerged, as did <a>Scottish national consciousness</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 38 </span></sup> The domination of Gaelic was diminished during the reign of <a>David I</a> (1124–53), during which many English-speaking colonists settled in Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 39 </span></sup> David I and his successors centralized royal power<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 41–42 </span></sup> and united mainland Scotland, capturing regions such as Moray, <a>Galloway</a>, and <a>Caithness</a>, although he did not succeed at extending his power over the <a>Hebrides</a>, which had been ruled by various <a>Scottish clans</a> following the death of <a>Somerled</a> in 1164.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 48–49 </span></sup> The system of <a>feudalism</a> was consolidated, with both Anglo-Norman incomers and native Gaelic chieftains being granted land in exchange for serving the king.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 53–54 </span></sup> The Scottish kings rejected English demands to subjugate themselves; and England invaded Scotland several times to prevent Scotland's expansion into northern England.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 45 </span></sup>

<p>
The death of <a>Alexander III</a> in March 1286 broke the succession line of Scotland's kings. <a>Edward I of England</a> arbitrated between various claimants for the Scottish crown. In return for surrendering Scotland's nominal independence, <a>John Balliol</a> was pronounced king in 1292.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 47 </span></sup><sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> In 1294, Balliol and other Scottish lords refused Edward's demands to serve in his army against the French. Scotland and France sealed a treaty on 23 October 1295, known as the <a>Auld Alliance</a>. War ensued, and John was deposed by Edward who took personal control of Scotland. <a>Andrew Moray</a> and <a>William Wallace</a> initially emerged as the principal leaders of the resistance to English rule in the <a>Wars of Scottish Independence</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> until <a>Robert the Bruce</a> was crowned king of Scotland in 1306.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> Victory at the <a>Battle of Bannockburn</a> in 1314 proved the Scots had regained control of their kingdom. In 1320 the world's first documented declaration of independence, the <a>Declaration of Arbroath</a>, won the support of <a>Pope John XXII</a>, leading to the legal recognition of Scottish sovereignty by the English Crown.

<p>
A civil war between the <a>Bruce dynasty</a> and their long-term rivals of the <a>House of Comyn</a> and <a>House of Balliol</a> lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although the Bruce faction was successful, <a>David II's</a> lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew <a>Robert II</a>, the <a>Lord High Steward of Scotland</a>, to come to the throne and establish the <a>House of Stewart</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><span>: 77 </span></sup> The Stewarts ruled Scotland for the remainder of the <a>Middle Ages</a>. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the <a>Reformation</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><sup><span>: 93 </span></sup> despite the effects of the <a>Black Death</a> in 1349<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><span>: 76 </span></sup> and increasing division between <a>Highlands</a> and <a>Lowlands</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><span>: 78 </span></sup> Multiple truces reduced warfare on the southern border.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><span>: 76, 83 </span></sup>

<p>
The <a>Treaty of Perpetual Peace</a> was signed in 1502 by <a>James IV of Scotland</a> and <a>Henry VII of England</a>. James married Henry's daughter, <a>Margaret Tudor</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> James invaded England in support of France under the terms of the Auld Alliance and became the last British monarch to die in battle, at <a>Flodden</a> in 1513.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> In 1560, the <a>Treaty of Edinburgh</a> brought an end to the Anglo-French conflict and recognized the Protestant <a>Elizabeth I</a> as Queen of England.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><sup><span>: 112 </span></sup> The <a>Parliament of Scotland</a> met and immediately adopted the <a>Scots Confession</a>, which signalled the <a>Scottish Reformation</a>'s sharp break from papal authority and Roman Catholic teaching.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><span>: 44 </span></sup> The Catholic <a>Mary, Queen of Scots</a> was forced to abdicate in 1567.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1603, <a>James VI, King of Scots</a> inherited the thrones of the <a>Kingdom of England</a> and the <a>Kingdom of Ireland</a> in the <a>Union of the Crowns</a>, and moved to London.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> The first <a>Union Jack</a> was designed at James's behest, to be flown in addition to the <a>St Andrew's Cross</a> on Scots vessels at sea. James VI and I intended to create a single kingdom of Great Britain, but was thwarted in his attempt to do so by the <a>Parliament of England</a>, which supported the wrecking proposal that a full legal union be sought instead, a proposal to which the Scots Parliament would not assent, causing the king to withdraw the plan.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
With the exception of a short period under <a>the Protectorate</a>, Scotland remained a separate state in the 17th century, but there was considerable conflict between the crown and the <a>Covenanters</a> over the form of <a>church government</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup><sup><span>: 124 </span></sup> The military was strengthened, allowing the imposition of royal authority on the western Highland clans. The 1609 <a>Statutes of Iona</a> compelled the cultural integration of Hebridean clan leaders.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup><sup><span>: 37–40 </span></sup> In 1641 and again in 1643 the Parliament of Scotland unsuccessfully sought a union with England which was "federative" and not "incorporating", in which Scotland would retain a separate parliament.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The issue of union split the parliament in 1648.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After the execution of the Scottish king at <a>Whitehall</a> in 1649, amid the <a>Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a> and <a>its events in Scotland</a>, <a>Oliver Cromwell</a>, the victorious <a>Lord Protector</a>, imposed the British Isles' first written constitution – the <a>Instrument of Government</a> – on Scotland in 1652 as part of the republican <a>Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The Protectorate Parliament was the first Westminster parliament to include representatives nominally from Scotland. The monarchy of the <a>House of Stuart</a> was resumed with the <a>Restoration in Scotland</a> in 1660.

</p>
<p>
The Parliament of Scotland sought a commercial union with England in 1664; the proposal was rejected in 1668.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> In 1670 the Parliament of England rejected a proposed political union with Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> English proposals along the same lines were abandoned in 1674 and in 1685.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The <a>Battle of Altimarlach</a> in 1680 was the last significant clan battle fought between <a>highland clans</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> After the fall and flight into exile of the Catholic Stuart king, <a>James VII and II</a> the <a>Glorious Revolution in Scotland</a> and the <a>Convention of Estates</a> replaced the House of Stuart in favour of <a>William III</a> and <a>Mary II</a> who was Mary Stuart.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup><sup><span>: 142 </span></sup> The Scots Parliament rejected proposals for a political union in 1689.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><a>Jacobitism</a> , the political support for the exiled Catholic Stuart dynasty, remained a threat to the security of the British state under the Protestant <a>House of Orange</a> and the succeeding <a>House of Hanover</a> until the defeat of the <a>Jacobite rising of 1745</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In common with countries such as France, Norway, Sweden and Finland, Scotland experienced <a>famines</a> during the 1690s. Mortality, reduced childbirths and increased emigration reduced the population of parts of the country about 10–15%.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> In 1698, the <a>Company of Scotland</a> attempted a project to secure a trading colony on the <a>Isthmus of Panama</a>. Almost every Scottish landowner who had money to spare is said to have invested in the <a>Darien scheme</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After another proposal from the English House of Lords was rejected in 1695, and a further Lords motion was voted down in the House of Commons in 1700, the Parliament of Scotland again rejected union in 1702.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The failure of the Darien Scheme bankrupted the landowners who had invested, though not the burghs. Nevertheless, the nobles' bankruptcy, along with the threat of an English invasion, played a leading role in convincing the Scots elite to back a union with England.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> On 22 July 1706, the <a>Treaty of Union</a> was agreed between representatives of the <a>Scots Parliament</a> and the <a>Parliament of England</a>. The following year, twin <a>Acts of Union</a> were passed by both parliaments to create the united <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a> with effect from 1 May 1707<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> with popular opposition and anti-union riots in <a>Edinburgh</a>, <a>Glasgow</a>, and elsewhere.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> The newly formed <a>Parliament of Great Britain</a> rejected proposals from the <a>Parliament of Ireland</a> that the third kingdom be incorporated in the union.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>

<p>
With trade tariffs with England abolished, trade blossomed, especially with <a>Colonial America</a>. The clippers belonging to the Glasgow <a>Tobacco Lords</a> were the fastest ships on the route to <a>Virginia</a>. Until the <a>American War of Independence</a> in 1776, Glasgow was the world's premier tobacco port, dominating world trade.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> The disparity between the wealth of the merchant classes of the Scottish Lowlands and the ancient clans of the Scottish Highlands grew, amplifying centuries of division.

</p>
<p>
The deposed <a>Jacobite Stuart</a> claimants had remained popular in the Highlands and north-east, particularly amongst non-<a>Presbyterians</a>, including Roman Catholics and <a>Episcopalian Protestants</a>. However, two major Jacobite risings launched in <a>1715</a> and <a>1745</a> failed to remove the <a>House of Hanover</a> from the British throne. The threat of the Jacobite movement to the United Kingdom and its monarchs effectively ended at the <a>Battle of Culloden</a>, Great Britain's last <a>pitched battle</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Scottish Enlightenment</a> and the <a>Industrial Revolution</a> turned Scotland into an intellectual, commercial and industrial powerhouse<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> – so much so <a>Voltaire</a> said "We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation."<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> With the demise of Jacobitism and the advent of the Union, thousands of Scots, mainly Lowlanders, took up numerous positions of power in politics, civil service, the army and navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the nascent <a>British Empire</a>. Historian Neil Davidson notes "after 1746 there was an entirely new level of participation by Scots in political life, particularly outside Scotland." Davidson also states "far from being 'peripheral' to the British economy, Scotland – or more precisely, the Lowlands – lay at its core."<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the Highlands, clan chiefs gradually started to think of themselves more as commercial landlords than leaders of their people. These social and economic changes included the first phase of the <a>Highland Clearances</a> and, ultimately, the demise of clanship.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup><sup><span>: 32–53, <i>passim</i></span></sup>

<p>
The <a>Scottish Reform Act 1832</a> increased the number of Scottish MPs and widened the franchise to include more of the middle classes.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> From the mid-century, there were increasing calls for Home Rule for Scotland and the post of <a>Secretary of State for Scotland</a> was revived.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Towards the end of the century Prime Ministers of Scottish descent included <a>William Gladstone</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> and <a>the Earl of Rosebery</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> In the late 19th century the growing importance of the working classes was marked by <a>Keir Hardie</a>'s success in the <a>Mid Lanarkshire by-election, 1888</a>, leading to the foundation of the <a>Scottish Labour Party</a>, which was absorbed into the <a>Independent Labour Party</a> in 1895, with Hardie as its first leader.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Glasgow became one of the largest cities in the world and known as "the <a>Second City of the Empire</a>" after London.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> After 1860 the Clydeside shipyards specialised in steamships made of iron (after 1870, made of steel), which rapidly replaced the wooden sailing vessels of both the merchant fleets and the battle fleets of the world. It became the world's pre-eminent shipbuilding centre.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> The industrial developments, while they brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision for public health did not keep pace with them, and for a time living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>

<p>
While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as the physicists <a>James Clerk Maxwell</a> and <a>Lord Kelvin</a>, and the engineers and inventors <a>James Watt</a> and <a>William Murdoch</a>, whose work was critical to the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution throughout Britain.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> In literature, the most successful figure of the mid-19th century was <a>Walter Scott</a>. His first prose work, <i><a>Waverley</a></i> in 1814, is often called the first historical novel.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> It launched a highly successful career that probably more than any other helped define and popularise Scottish cultural identity.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup> In the late 19th century, a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations, such as <a>Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, <a>Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a>J. M. Barrie</a> and <a>George MacDonald</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup> Scotland also played a major part in the development of art and architecture. The <a>Glasgow School</a>, which developed in the late 19th century, and flourished in the early 20th century, produced a distinctive blend of influences including the <a>Celtic Revival</a> the <a>Arts and Crafts movement</a>, and <a>Japonism</a>, which found favour throughout the <a>modern art</a> world of continental Europe and helped define the <a>Art Nouveau</a> style. Proponents included architect and artist <a>Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
This period saw a process of rehabilitation for Highland culture. In the 1820s, as part of the <a>Romantic revival</a>, <a>tartan</a> and the <a>kilt</a> were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe,<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup> prompted by the popularity of Macpherson's <a>Ossian</a> cycle<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> and then Walter Scott's Waverley novels.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup> However, the Highlands remained poor, the only part of mainland Britain to continue to experience recurrent famine, with a limited range of products exported out of the region, negligible industrial production, but a continued population growth that tested the subsistence agriculture. These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing <a>Highland Clearances</a>, in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the <a>Highland Potato Famine</a> and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> The population of Scotland grew steadily in the 19th century, from 1,608,000 in the census of 1801 to 2,889,000 in 1851 and 4,472,000 in 1901.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> Even with the development of industry, there were not enough good jobs. As a result, during the period 1841–1931, about 2 million Scots migrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>

<p>
After prolonged years of struggle in the Kirk, in 1834 the Evangelicals gained control of the <a>General Assembly</a> and passed the Veto Act, which allowed congregations to reject unwanted "intrusive" presentations to livings by patrons. The following "Ten Years' Conflict" of legal and political wrangling ended in defeat for the non-intrusionists in the civil courts. The result was a schism from the church by some of the non-intrusionists led by Dr <a>Thomas Chalmers</a>, known as the Great <a>Disruption of 1843</a>. Roughly a third of the clergy, mainly from the North and Highlands, formed the separate <a>Free Church of Scotland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> In the late 19th century growing divisions between fundamentalist Calvinists and theological liberals resulted in a further split in the Free Church as the rigid Calvinists broke away to form the <a>Free Presbyterian Church</a> in 1893.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup><a>Catholic emancipation</a>  in 1829 and the influx of large numbers of Irish immigrants, particularly after the famine years of the late 1840s, mainly to the growing lowland centres like Glasgow, led to a transformation in the fortunes of Catholicism. In 1878, despite opposition, a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical hierarchy was restored to the country, and Catholicism became a significant denomination within Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Industrialisation, urbanisation and the Disruption of 1843 all undermined the tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup> The historic <a>University of Glasgow</a> became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup><a>The University of St Andrews</a>  pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup>

<p>
Caused by the advent of <a>refrigeration</a> and imports of lamb, mutton and wool from overseas, the 1870s brought with them a collapse of sheep prices and an abrupt halt in the previous sheep farming boom.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> Land prices subsequently plummeted, too, and accelerated the process of the so-called "Balmoralisation" of Scotland, an era in the second half of the 19th century that saw an increase in tourism and the establishment of large estates dedicated to <a>field sports</a> like <a>deer stalking</a> and <a>grouse shooting</a>, especially in the Scottish Highlands.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> The process was named after <a>Balmoral estate</a>, purchased by Queen Victoria in 1848, that fuelled the romanticisation of upland Scotland and initiated an influx of the newly wealthy acquiring similar estates in the following decades.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> In the late 19th century just 118 people owned half of Scotland, with nearly 60 per cent of the whole country being part of shooting estates.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> While their relative importance has somewhat declined due to changing recreational interests throughout the 20th century, deer stalking and grouse shooting remain of prime importance on many private estates in Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup>

<p>
Scotland played a major role in the <a>British effort</a> in the <a>First World War</a>. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, fish and money.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent over half a million men to the war, of whom over a quarter died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup><a>Field Marshal</a><a>Sir Douglas Haig</a>   was Britain's commander on the Western Front.

</p>
<p>
The war saw the emergence of a radical movement called "<a>Red Clydeside</a>" led by militant trades unionists. Formerly a <a>Liberal</a> stronghold, the industrial districts switched to <a>Labour</a> by 1922, with a base among the <a>Irish Catholic</a> working-class districts. Women were especially active in building neighbourhood solidarity on housing issues. However, the "Reds" operated within the Labour Party and had little influence in Parliament and the mood changed to passive despair by the late 1920s.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The shipbuilding industry expanded by a third and expected renewed prosperity, but instead, a serious depression hit the economy by 1922 and it did not fully recover until 1939. The interwar years were marked by economic stagnation in rural and urban areas, and high unemployment.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> Indeed, the war brought with it deep social, cultural, economic, and political dislocations. Thoughtful Scots pondered their declension, as the main social indicators such as poor health, bad housing, and long-term mass unemployment, pointed to terminal social and economic stagnation at best, or even a downward spiral. Service abroad on behalf of the Empire lost its allure to ambitious young people, who left Scotland permanently. The heavy dependence on obsolescent heavy industry and mining was a central problem, and no one offered workable solutions. The despair reflected what Finlay (1994) describes as a widespread sense of hopelessness that prepared local business and political leaders to accept a new orthodoxy of centralised government economic planning when it arrived during the <a>Second World War</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the Second World War, Scotland was targeted by <a>Nazi Germany</a> largely due to its factories, shipyards, and coal mines.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> Cities such as <a>Glasgow</a> and <a>Edinburgh</a> were targeted by German bombers, as were smaller towns mostly located in the central belt of the country.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> Perhaps the most significant air-raid in Scotland was the <a>Clydebank Blitz</a> of March 1941, which intended to destroy naval shipbuilding in the area.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> 528 people were killed and 4,000 homes totally destroyed.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps Scotland's most unusual wartime episode occurred in 1941 when <a>Rudolf Hess</a> flew to Renfrewshire, possibly intending to broker a peace deal through the <a>Duke of Hamilton</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> Before his departure from Germany, Hess had given his adjutant, <a>Karlheinz Pintsch</a>, a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British. Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup><a>Albert Speer</a>  later said Hitler described Hess's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life, as he considered it a personal betrayal.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup> Hitler worried that his allies, Italy and Japan, would perceive Hess's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British.

As in World War I, <a>Scapa Flow</a> in Orkney served as an important <a>Royal Navy</a> base. Attacks on Scapa Flow and <a>Rosyth</a> gave RAF fighters their first successes downing bombers in the <a>Firth of Forth</a> and <a>East Lothian</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> The shipyards and heavy engineering factories in <a>Glasgow</a> and Clydeside played a key part in the war effort, and suffered attacks from the <a>Luftwaffe</a>, enduring great destruction and loss of life.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup> As transatlantic voyages involved negotiating north-west Britain, Scotland played a key part in the battle of the North Atlantic.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup><a>Shetland</a> 's relative proximity to occupied Norway resulted in the <a>Shetland bus</a> by which fishing boats helped Norwegians flee the <a>Nazis</a>, and expeditions across the <a>North Sea</a> to assist resistance.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scottish industry came out of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup> Agriculture prospered, as did all sectors except for coal mining, which was operating mines near exhaustion. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25% and unemployment temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition.

<p>
After 1945, Scotland's economic situation worsened due to overseas competition, inefficient industry, and industrial disputes.<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> Only in recent decades has the country enjoyed something of a cultural and economic renaissance. Economic factors contributing to this recovery included a resurgent financial services industry, <a>electronics manufacturing</a>, (see <a>Silicon Glen</a>),<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup> and the <a>North Sea oil</a> and gas industry.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup> The introduction in 1989 by Margaret Thatcher's government of the <a>Community Charge</a> (widely known as the Poll Tax) one year before the rest of Great Britain,<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> contributed to a growing movement for Scottish control over domestic affairs.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup> Following a <a>referendum on devolution proposals in 1997</a>, the <a>Scotland Act 1998</a><sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup> was passed by the British Parliament, which established a devolved <a>Scottish Parliament</a> and <a>Scottish Government</a> with responsibility for most laws specific to Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_125">[125]</a></sup> The Scottish Parliament was reconvened in <a>Edinburgh</a> on 4 July 1999.<sup><a href="#ref_126">[126]</a></sup> The first to hold the office of <a>first minister of Scotland</a> was <a>Donald Dewar</a>, who served until his sudden death in 2000.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup>

The <a>Scottish Parliament Building</a> at Holyrood opened in October 2004 after lengthy construction delays and running over budget.<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup> The Scottish Parliament's form of <a>proportional representation</a> (the <a>additional member system</a>) resulted in no one party having an overall majority for the first three Scottish parliament elections. However, the pro-<a>independence</a><a>Scottish National Party</a>  led by <a>Alex Salmond</a> achieved an overall majority in the <a>2011 election</a>, winning 69 of the 129 seats available.<sup><a href="#ref_129">[129]</a></sup> The success of the SNP in achieving a majority in the Scottish Parliament paved the way for the <a>September 2014 referendum on Scottish independence</a>. The majority voted against the proposition, with 55% voting no to independence.<sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup> More powers, particularly in relation to taxation, were devolved to the Scottish Parliament after the referendum, following cross-party talks in the <a>Smith Commission</a>.

The mainland of Scotland comprises the northern third of the land mass of the island of Great Britain, which lies off the north-west coast of <a>Continental Europe</a>. The total area is 78,772 km<sup>2</sup> (30,414 sq mi),<sup><a href="#ref_131">[131]</a></sup> comparable to the size of the Czech Republic. Scotland's only land border is with England, and runs for 96 kilometres (60 mi) between the basin of the <a>River Tweed</a> on the east coast and the <a>Solway Firth</a> in the west. The Atlantic Ocean borders the west coast and the <a>North Sea</a> is to the east. The island of Ireland lies only 21 kilometres (13 mi) from the south-western peninsula of <a>Kintyre</a>;<sup><a href="#ref_132">[132]</a></sup> Norway is 305 kilometres (190 mi) to the east and the <a>Faroe Islands</a>, 270 kilometres (168 mi) to the north.

</p>
<p>
The territorial extent of Scotland is generally that established by the 1237 <a>Treaty of York</a> between Scotland and the Kingdom of England<sup><a href="#ref_133">[133]</a></sup> and the 1266 <a>Treaty of Perth</a> between Scotland and Norway.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> Important exceptions include the <a>Isle of Man</a>, which having been lost to England in the 14th century is now a <a>crown dependency</a> outside of the United Kingdom; the island groups <a>Orkney</a> and <a>Shetland</a>, which were acquired from Norway in 1472;<sup><a href="#ref_131">[131]</a></sup> and <a>Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, lost to England in 1482

<p>
The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the <a>Pleistocene</a><a>ice ages</a>  and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Highlands and Islands</a> lie to the north and west of the <a>Highland Boundary Fault</a>, which runs from <a>Arran</a> to <a>Stonehaven</a>. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the <a>Cambrian</a> and <a>Precambrian</a>, which were uplifted during the later <a>Caledonian orogeny</a>. It is interspersed with <a>igneous</a> intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the <a>Cairngorms</a> and <a>Skye</a><a>Cuillins</a> .<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In north-eastern mainland Scotland <a>weathering</a> of rock that occurred before the <a>Last Ice Age</a> has shaped much of the landscape.<sup><a href="#ref_137">[137]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/GlenfinnanShiel.jpg/290px-GlenfinnanShiel.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of <a>Old Red Sandstones</a> found principally along the <a>Moray Firth</a> coast. The <a>Highlands</a> are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the <a>Inner Hebrides</a> and <a>Outer Hebrides</a>. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including <a>Loch Lomond</a> and <a>Loch Ness</a>. Some parts of the coastline consist of <a>machair</a>, a low-lying dune pasture land.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Central Lowlands</a> is a <a>rift valley</a> mainly comprising <a>Paleozoic</a> formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's <a>industrial revolution</a> are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, <a>Arthur's Seat</a> in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the <a>Ochils</a> and <a>Campsie Fells</a> are rarely far from view.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Southern Uplands</a> are a range of hills almost 200 kilometres (124 mi) long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second <a>fault line</a> (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from <a>Girvan</a> to <a>Dunbar</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_138">[138]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup> The geological foundations largely comprise <a>Silurian</a> deposits laid down some 400–500 million years ago. The high point of the Southern Uplands is <a>Merrick</a> with an elevation of 843 m (2,766 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_141">[141]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_142">[142]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_143">[143]</a></sup> The Southern Uplands is home to Scotland's highest village, <a>Wanlockhead</a> (430 m or 1,411 ft above sea level).<sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Traigh_Bail%2C_Tiree_-_geograph.org.uk_-_7983.jpg/220px-Traigh_Bail%2C_Tiree_-_geograph.org.uk_-_7983.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The climate of most of Scotland is <a>temperate</a> and <a>oceanic</a>, and tends to be very changeable., As it is warmed by the <a>Gulf Stream</a> from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as <a>Labrador</a>, southern <a>Scandinavia</a>, the Moscow region in Russia, and the <a>Kamchatka Peninsula</a> on the opposite side of <a>Eurasia</a>. However, temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the temperature of −27.2 °C (−17.0 °F) recorded at <a>Braemar</a> in the <a>Grampian Mountains</a>, on 11 February 1895, the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> Winter maxima average 6 °C (43 °F) in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging 18 °C (64 °F). The highest temperature recorded was 32.9 °C (91.2 °F) at <a>Greycrook</a>, <a>Scottish Borders</a> on 9 August 2003.<sup><a href="#ref_145">[145]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic <a>ocean currents</a> and the colder surface temperatures of the <a>North Sea</a>. <a>Tiree</a>, in the Inner Hebrides, is one of the sunniest places in the country: it had more than 300 hours of sunshine in May 1975.<sup><a href="#ref_145">[145]</a></sup> Rainfall varies widely across Scotland. The western highlands of Scotland are the wettest, with annual rainfall in a few places exceeding 3,000 mm (120 in).<sup><a href="#ref_146">[146]</a></sup> In comparison, much of lowland Scotland receives less than 800 mm (31 in) annually.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup> Heavy snowfall is not common in the lowlands, but becomes more common with altitude. Braemar has an average of 59 snow days per year,<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup> while many coastal areas average fewer than 10 days of lying snow per year.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup>

<p>
Scotland's wildlife is typical of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting grounds for a variety of seabirds such as <a>gannets</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> The <a>golden eagle</a> is something of a national icon.<sup><a href="#ref_150">[150]</a></sup>

On the high mountain tops, species including <a>ptarmigan</a>, <a>mountain hare</a> and <a>stoat</a> can be seen in their white colour phase during winter months.<sup><a href="#ref_151">[151]</a></sup> Remnants of the native <a>Scots pine</a> forest exist<sup><a href="#ref_152">[152]</a></sup> and within these areas the <a>Scottish crossbill</a>, the UK's only <a>endemic</a> bird species and <a>vertebrate</a>, can be found alongside <a>capercaillie</a>, <a>Scottish wildcat</a>, <a>red squirrel</a> and <a>pine marten</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_155">[155]</a></sup> Various animals have been re-introduced, including the <a>white-tailed sea eagle</a> in 1975, the <a>red kite</a> in the 1980s,<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup> and there have been experimental projects involving the <a>beaver</a> and <a>wild boar</a>. Today, much of the remaining native <a>Caledonian Forest</a> lies within the <a>Cairngorms National Park</a> and remnants of the forest remain at 84 locations across Scotland. On the west coast, remnants of ancient Celtic Rainforest still remain, particularly on the Taynish peninsula in <a>Argyll</a>, these forests are particularly rare due to high rates of deforestation throughout Scottish history.<sup><a href="#ref_158">[158]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The flora of the country is varied incorporating both <a>deciduous</a> and <a>coniferous</a> woodland as well as <a>moorland</a> and <a>tundra</a> species. However, large scale commercial tree planting and the management of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and <a>field sport</a> activities like <a>deer stalking</a> and <a>driven grouse shooting</a> impacts the distribution of <a>indigenous</a> plants and animals.<sup><a href="#ref_160">[160]</a></sup> The UK's tallest tree is a <a>grand fir</a> planted beside <a>Loch Fyne</a>, Argyll in the 1870s, and the <a>Fortingall Yew</a> may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe.<sup>[<i><a><span>dubious</span></a><span> – <a>discuss</a></span></i>]</sup><sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup> Although the number of native <a>vascular plants</a> is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial <a>bryophyte</a> flora is of global importance.<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup>

The population of Scotland at the 2001 Census was 5,062,011. This rose to 5,295,400, the highest ever, at the 2011 Census.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup> The most recent ONS estimate, for mid-2019, was 5,463,300.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>

In the 2011 Census, 62% of Scotland's population stated their <a>national identity</a> as '<a>Scottish</a> only', 18% as 'Scottish and British', 8% as 'British only', and 4% chose 'other identity only'.<sup><a href="#ref_167">[167]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Although Edinburgh is the capital of Scotland, the largest city is Glasgow, which has just over 584,000 inhabitants. The <a>Greater Glasgow</a> conurbation, with a population of almost 1.2 million, is home to nearly a quarter of Scotland's population.<sup><a href="#ref_168">[168]</a></sup> The <a>Central Belt</a> is where most of the main towns and cities are located, including Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, and Perth. Scotland's only major city outside the Central Belt is Aberdeen. The <a>Scottish Lowlands</a> host 80% of the total population, where the <a>Central Belt</a> accounts for 3.5 million people.

</p>
<p>
In general, only the more accessible and larger islands remain inhabited. Currently, fewer than 90 remain inhabited. The Southern Uplands are essentially rural in nature and dominated by agriculture and forestry.<sup><a href="#ref_169">[169]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> Because of housing problems in Glasgow and Edinburgh, <a>five new towns</a> were designated between 1947 and 1966. They are <a>East Kilbride</a>, <a>Glenrothes</a>, <a>Cumbernauld</a>, <a>Livingston</a>, and <a>Irvine</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_171">[171]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Immigration since World War II has given Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee small South Asian communities.<sup><a href="#ref_172">[172]</a></sup> In 2011, there were an estimated 49,000 ethnically Pakistani people living in Scotland, making them the largest non-White ethnic group.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Since the <a>enlargement of the European Union</a> more people from <a>Central</a> and Eastern Europe have moved to Scotland, and the 2011 census indicated that 61,000 <a>Poles</a> live there.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_173">[173]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scotland has three officially recognised languages: English, <a>Scots</a>, and <a>Scottish Gaelic</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_175">[175]</a></sup> Scottish Standard English, a variety of English as spoken in Scotland, is at one end of a bipolar <a>linguistic continuum</a>, with broad <a>Scots</a> at the other.<sup><a href="#ref_176">[176]</a></sup> Scottish Standard English may have been influenced to varying degrees by Scots.<sup><a href="#ref_177">[177]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup> The 2011 census indicated that 63% of the population had "no skills in Scots".<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup> Others speak <a>Highland English</a>. Gaelic is mostly spoken in the <a>Western Isles</a>, where a large proportion of people still speak it; however, nationally its use is confined to just 1% of the population.<sup><a href="#ref_180">[180]</a></sup> The number of Gaelic speakers in Scotland dropped from 250,000 in 1881 to 60,000 in 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_181">[181]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are many more people with Scottish ancestry living abroad than the total population of Scotland. In the 2000 Census, 9.2 million Americans self-reported some degree of <a>Scottish</a> descent.<sup><a href="#ref_182">[182]</a></sup><a>Ulster</a> 's Protestant population is mainly of lowland Scottish descent,<sup><a href="#ref_183">[183]</a></sup> and it is estimated that there are more than 27 million descendants of the <a>Scots-Irish</a> migration now living in the US.<sup><a href="#ref_184">[184]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_185">[185]</a></sup> In Canada, the <a>Scottish-Canadian</a> community accounts for 4.7 million people.<sup><a href="#ref_186">[186]</a></sup> About 20% of the original European settler population of New Zealand came from Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_187">[187]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In August 2012, the Scottish population reached an all-time high of 5.25 million people.<sup><a href="#ref_188">[188]</a></sup> The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and immigrants were moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_188">[188]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>total fertility rate</a> (TFR) in Scotland is below the replacement rate of 2.1 (the TFR was 1.73 in 2011<sup><a href="#ref_189">[189]</a></sup>). The majority of births are to unmarried women (51.3% of births were outside of marriage in 2012<sup><a href="#ref_190">[190]</a></sup>).

</p>
<p>
Life expectancy for those born in Scotland between 2012 and 2014 is 77.1 years for males and 81.1 years for females.<sup><a href="#ref_191">[191]</a></sup> This is the lowest of any of the four countries of the UK.<sup><a href="#ref_191">[191]</a></sup>

Just over half (54%) of the Scottish population reported being a <a>Christian</a> while nearly 37% reported not having a religion in a 2011 census.<sup><a href="#ref_193">[193]</a></sup>
Since the <a>Scottish Reformation</a> of 1560, the <a>national church</a> (the <a>Church of Scotland</a>, also known as <a>The Kirk</a>) has been <a>Protestant</a> in classification and <a>Reformed</a> in theology. Since 1689 it has had a <a>Presbyterian</a> system of church government and enjoys independence from the state.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> Its membership is 398,389,<sup><a href="#ref_194">[194]</a></sup> about 7.5% of the total population, though according to the 2014 Scottish Annual Household Survey, 27.8%, or 1.5 million adherents, identified the Church of Scotland as the church of their religion.<sup><a href="#ref_195">[195]</a></sup> The Church operates a territorial parish structure, with every community in Scotland having a local congregation.

</p>
<p>
Scotland also has a significant <a>Roman Catholic</a> population, 19% professing that faith, particularly in Greater Glasgow and the north-west.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup> After the Reformation, Roman Catholicism in Scotland continued in the Highlands and some western islands like <a>Uist</a> and <a>Barra</a>, and it was strengthened during the 19th century by immigration from Ireland. Other Christian denominations in Scotland include the <a>Free Church of Scotland</a>, and various other Presbyterian offshoots. Scotland's third largest church is the <a>Scottish Episcopal Church</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_197">[197]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are an estimated 75,000 Muslims in Scotland (about 1.4% of the population),<sup><a href="#ref_193">[193]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup> and significant but smaller <a>Jewish</a>, <a>Hindu</a> and <a>Sikh</a> communities, especially in Glasgow.<sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup> The <a>Samyé Ling</a> monastery near <a>Eskdalemuir</a>, which celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2007, is the first <a>Buddhist</a> monastery in western Europe.<sup><a href="#ref_199">[199]</a></sup>

The head of state of the United Kingdom is the monarch, currently <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> (since 1952). The monarchy of the United Kingdom continues to use a variety of styles, titles and other royal symbols of statehood specific to pre-union Scotland, including: the <a>Royal Standard of Scotland</a>, the <a>Royal coat of arms</a> used in Scotland together with its associated <a>Royal Standard</a>, royal titles including that of <a>Duke of Rothesay</a>, certain <a>Great Officers of State</a>, the <a>chivalric</a><a>Order of the Thistle</a>  and, since 1999, reinstating a ceremonial role for the <a>Crown of Scotland</a> after a 292-year hiatus.<sup><a href="#ref_200">[200]</a></sup> Elizabeth II's <a>regnal numbering</a> caused <a>controversy</a> in 1953 because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland. <a>MacCormick v Lord Advocate</a> was a legal action was brought in Scotland's <a>Court of Session</a> by the <a>Scottish Covenant Association</a> to contest the right of the Queen to entitle herself "Elizabeth II" within Scotland, but <a>the Crown</a> won the appeal against the case's dismissal, since as royal titulature was legislated for by the Royal Titles Act 1953 and a matter of <a>royal prerogative</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_201">[201]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scotland has limited <a>self-government</a> within the United Kingdom, as well as representation in the British Parliament. Executive and legislative powers respectively have been devolved to the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament at <a>Holyrood</a> in Edinburgh since 1999. The British Parliament retains control over <a>reserved matters</a> specified in the <a>Scotland Act 1998</a>, including taxes, social security, defence, international relations and broadcasting.<sup><a href="#ref_202">[202]</a></sup> The Scottish Parliament has legislative authority for all other areas relating to Scotland. It initially had only a limited power to <a>vary income tax</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_203">[203]</a></sup> but powers over taxation and social security were significantly expanded by the Scotland Acts of <a>2012</a> and <a>2016</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_204">[204]</a></sup> The 2016 Act gave the Scottish Government powers to manage the affairs of the <a>Crown Estate</a> in Scotland, leading to the creation of <a>Crown Estate Scotland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_205">[205]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Scottish Parliament can give legislative consent over devolved matters back to the British Parliament by passing a <a>Legislative Consent Motion</a> if United Kingdom-wide legislation is considered more appropriate for a certain issue. The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen a divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the UK. For instance, university education and some care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland, while fees are paid in the rest of the UK. Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in enclosed public places.<sup><a href="#ref_206">[206]</a></sup>

<p>
The Scottish Parliament is a <a>unicameral</a> legislature with 129 members (MSPs): 73 of them represent individual constituencies and are elected on a <a>first-past-the-post</a> system; the other 56 are elected in eight different electoral regions by the <a>additional member system</a>. MSPs normally serve for a five-year period.<sup><a href="#ref_207">[207]</a></sup> The Parliament nominates one of its Members, who is then appointed by the monarch to serve as first minister. Other ministers are appointed by the first minister and serve at his/her discretion. Together they make up the Scottish Government, the executive arm of the devolved government.<sup><a href="#ref_208">[208]</a></sup> The Scottish Government is headed by the first minister, who is accountable to the <a>Scottish Parliament</a> and is the minister of charge of the Scottish Government. The first minister is also the political leader of Scotland. The Scottish Government also comprises the <a>deputy first minister</a>, currently <a>John Swinney</a> MSP, who deputises for the first minister during a period of absence. Alongside the deputy first minister's requirements as Deputy, the minister also has a cabinet ministerial responsibility.<sup><a href="#ref_209">[209]</a></sup> The <a>current Scottish Government</a> has nine cabinet secretaries and there are 15 other ministers who work alongside the cabinet secretaries in their appointed areas.<sup><a href="#ref_210">[210]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the <a>2021 election</a>, the <a>Scottish National Party</a> (SNP) won 64 of the 129 seats available.<sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup><a>Nicola Sturgeon</a> , the leader of the SNP, has been the first minister since November 2014.<sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup> The <a>Scottish Conservatives</a>, <a>Scottish Labour</a>, the <a>Scottish Liberal Democrats</a> and the <a>Scottish Greens</a> also have representation in the Parliament.<sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup> The <a>next Scottish Parliament election</a> is due to be held on 7 May 2026.<sup><a href="#ref_213">[213]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scotland is represented in the British <a>House of Commons</a> by 59 MPs elected from territory-based Scottish constituencies. In the <a>2019 general election</a>, the SNP won 48 of the 59 seats.<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup> This represented a significant increase from the <a>2017 general election</a>, when the SNP won 35 seats.<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_215">[215]</a></sup> Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties also represent Scottish constituencies in the House of Commons.<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup> The <a>next general election</a> is scheduled for 2 May 2024. The <a>Scotland Office</a> represents the British government in Scotland on reserved matters and represents Scottish interests within the government.<sup><a href="#ref_216">[216]</a></sup> The Scotland Office is led by the <a>Secretary of State for Scotland</a>, who sits in the <a>Cabinet of the United Kingdom</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup> Conservative MP <a>Alister Jack</a> has held the position since July 2019.<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup>

<p>
The relationships between the central government of the UK and devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are based on the extra-statutory principles and agreements with the main elements being set out in a <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i> between the British government and the devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The MOU lays emphasis on the principles of good communication, consultation and co-operation.<sup><a href="#ref_218">[218]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Since devolution in 1999, Scotland has devolved stronger working relations across the two other devolved governments, the <a>Welsh Government</a> and <a>Northern Ireland Executive</a>. Whilst there are no formal concordats between the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, ministers from each devolved government meet at various points throughout the year at various events such as the British-Irish Council and also meet to discuss matters and issues that are devolved to each government.<sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup> Scotland, along with the Welsh Government, British Government as well as the Northern Ireland executive, participate in the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) which allows each government to discuss policy issues together and work together across each government to find solutions. The Scottish Government considers the successful re-establishment of the Plenary, and establishment of the Domestic fora to be important facets of the relationship with the British Government and the other devolved administrations.<sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of the United Kingdom's decision to withdraw from the European Union in 2016, the Scottish Government has called for there to be a joint approach from each of the devolved governments. In early 2017, the devolved governments met to discuss Brexit and agree on Brexit strategies from each devolved government<sup><a href="#ref_220">[220]</a></sup> which lead for <a>Theresa May</a> to issue a statement that claims that the devolved governments will not have a central role or decision making process in the Brexit process, but that the central government plans to "fully engage" Scotland in talks alongside the governments of Wales and Northern Ireland.<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup>

<p>
Whilst foreign policy remains a reserved matter,<sup><a href="#ref_222">[222]</a></sup> the Scottish Government still has the power and ability to strengthen and develop Scotland, the economy and Scottish interests on the world stage and encourage foreign businesses, international devolved, regional and central governments to invest in Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_223">[223]</a></sup> Whilst the first minister usually undertakes a number of foreign and international visits to promote Scotland, international relations, European and Commonwealth relations are also included within the portfolios of both the <a>Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs</a> (responsible for international development)<sup><a href="#ref_224">[224]</a></sup> and the <a>Minister for International Development and Europe</a> (responsible for European Union relations and international relations).<sup><a href="#ref_225">[225]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Whilst an independent sovereign nation, Scotland had a close "special relationship" with <a>France</a> (known then as the <a>Kingdom of France</a>). In 1295, both Scotland and France signed what became known as the <a>Auld Alliance</a> in <a>Paris</a>, which acted as a military and diplomatic alliance between English invasion and expansion.<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> The French military sought the assistance of Scotland in 1415 during the <a>Battle of Agincourt</a> which was close to bringing the Kingdom of France to collapse.<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> The Auld Alliance was seen as important for Scotland and its position within Europe, having signed a treaty of military, economic and diplomatic co-operation with a wealthy European nation.<sup><a href="#ref_227">[227]</a></sup> There had been an agreement between Scotland and France that allowed citizens of both countries to hold dual citizenship, however, this was revoked by the French Government in 1903.<sup><a href="#ref_228">[228]</a></sup> In recent times, there have been arguments that indicate that the Auld Alliance was never formally ended by either Scotland or France, and that many elements of the treaty may remain in place today.<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup> Scotland and France do, however, continue to have a special relationship, with a Statement of Intent being signed in 2013 which committed both Scotland and France to building on shared history, friendship, co-operation between governments and cultural exchange programmes.<sup><a href="#ref_230">[230]</a></sup>

During the <a>G8 Summit</a> in 2005, the first minister <a>Jack McConnell</a> welcomed each head of government of the G8 nations to the country's <a>Glasgow Prestwick Airport</a><sup><a href="#ref_231">[231]</a></sup> on behalf of then prime minister <a>Tony Blair</a>. At the same time, McConnell and the then Scottish Executive pioneered the way forward to launch what would become the <a>Scotland Malawi Partnership</a> which co-ordinates Scottish activities to strengthen existing links with <a>Malawi</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_232">[232]</a></sup> During McConnell's time as first minister, several relations with Scotland, including Scottish and Russian relations strengthened following a visit by <a>President of Russia</a><a>Vladimir Putin</a>  to <a>Edinburgh</a>. McConnell, speaking at the end, highlighted that the visit by Putin was a "post-devolution" step towards "Scotland regaining its international identity".<sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup>

Under the Salmond administration, Scotland's trade and investment deals with countries such as China<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> and Canada, where Salmond established the Canada Plan 2010–2015 which aimed to strengthen "the important historical, cultural and economic links" between both Canada and Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup> To promote Scotland's interests and Scottish businesses in North America, there is a Scottish Affairs Office located in <a>Washington, D.C.</a> with the aim to promoting Scotland in both the United States and Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_237">[237]</a></sup>

During a 2017 visit to the United States, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon met <a>Jerry Brown</a>, <a>Governor of California</a>, where both signed an agreement committing both the Government of California and the Scottish Government to work together to tackle <a>climate change</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_238">[238]</a></sup> as well as Sturgeon signing a £6.3 million deal for Scottish investment from American businesses and firms promoting trade, tourism and innovation.<sup><a href="#ref_239">[239]</a></sup> During an official visit to the <a>Republic of Ireland</a> in 2016, Sturgeon claimed that is it "important for Ireland and Scotland and the whole of the British Isles that Ireland has a strong ally in Scotland".<sup><a href="#ref_240">[240]</a></sup> During the same engagement, Sturgeon became the first head of government to address the <a>Seanad Éireann</a>, the <a>upper house</a> of the <a>Oireachtas</a> (the Irish parliament).<sup><a href="#ref_240">[240]</a></sup>

<p>
A policy of <a>devolution</a> had been advocated by the three main British political parties with varying enthusiasm during recent history. A previous Labour leader, <a>John Smith</a>, described the revival of a Scottish parliament as the "settled will of the Scottish people".<sup><a href="#ref_243">[243]</a></sup> The devolved Scottish Parliament was created after a <a>referendum in 1997</a> found majority support for both creating the Parliament and granting it limited powers to <a>vary income tax</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_244">[244]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports <a>Scottish independence</a>, was first elected to form the Scottish Government in <a>2007</a>. The new government established a "<a>National Conversation</a>" on constitutional issues, proposing a number of options such as increasing the powers of the Scottish Parliament, <a>federalism</a>, or a referendum on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. In rejecting the last option, the three main opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament created a <a>commission</a> to investigate the distribution of powers between devolved Scottish and UK-wide bodies.<sup><a href="#ref_245">[245]</a></sup> The <a>Scotland Act 2012</a>, based on proposals by the commission, was subsequently enacted devolving additional powers to the Scottish Parliament.<sup><a href="#ref_246">[246]</a></sup>

In August 2009 the SNP proposed a bill to hold a referendum on independence in November 2010. Opposition from all other major parties led to an expected defeat.<sup><a href="#ref_247">[247]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_248">[248]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_249">[249]</a></sup> After the <a>2011 Scottish Parliament election</a> gave the SNP an overall majority in the Scottish Parliament, the <a>2014 Scottish independence referendum</a> was held on 18 September.<sup><a href="#ref_250">[250]</a></sup> The referendum resulted in a rejection of independence, by 55.3% to 44.7%.<sup><a href="#ref_251">[251]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_252">[252]</a></sup> During the campaign, the three main parties in the British Parliament pledged to extend the powers of the Scottish Parliament.<sup><a href="#ref_253">[253]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_254">[254]</a></sup> An all-party <a>commission</a> chaired by <a>Robert Smith, Baron Smith of Kelvin</a> was formed,<sup><a href="#ref_254">[254]</a></sup> which led to a further devolution of powers through the <a>Scotland Act 2016</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_255">[255]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Following the <a>European Union Referendum Act 2015</a>, the <a>2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum</a> was held on 23 June 2016 on Britain's membership of the <a>European Union</a>. A majority in the United Kingdom voted to withdraw from the EU, whilst a majority within Scotland voted to remain a member.<sup><a href="#ref_256">[256]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced the following day that as a result a <a>new independence referendum</a> was "highly likely".<sup><a href="#ref_257">[257]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_256">[256]</a></sup> On 31 January 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union. At Holyrood, Sturgeon's governing SNP continues to campaign for such a referendum; in December 2019 a formal request for the powers to hold one under Section 30 of the Scotland Act was submitted.<sup><a href="#ref_258">[258]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_259">[259]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_260">[260]</a></sup> At Westminster, the governing <a>second Johnson ministry</a> of the <a>Conservative Party</a> is opposed to another referendum and has refused the first minister's request.<sup><a href="#ref_261">[261]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_262">[262]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_263">[263]</a></sup> Because constitutional affairs are reserved matters under the Scotland Act, the Scottish Parliament would again have to be granted temporary additional powers under Section 30 in order to hold a legally binding vote.<sup><a href="#ref_262">[262]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_264">[264]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_265">[265]</a></sup>

Historical subdivisions of Scotland included the <a>mormaerdom</a>, <a>stewartry</a>, <a>earldom</a>, <a>burgh</a>, <a>parish</a>, <a>county</a> and <a>regions and districts</a>. Some of these names are still sometimes used as geographical descriptors.<sup><a href="#ref_266">[266]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Modern Scotland is subdivided in various ways depending on the purpose. In local government, there have been 32 single-tier council areas since 1996,<sup><a href="#ref_267">[267]</a></sup> whose councils are responsible for the provision of all local government services. Decisions are made by councillors who are elected at <a>local elections</a> every five years. The head of each council is usually the <a>Lord Provost</a> alongside the Leader of the council,<sup><a href="#ref_268">[268]</a></sup> with a Chief Executive being appointed as director of the council area.<sup><a href="#ref_269">[269]</a></sup> Community Councils are informal organisations that represent specific sub-divisions within each council area.<sup><a href="#ref_266">[266]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the Scottish Parliament, there are 73 constituencies and eight regions. For the Parliament of the United Kingdom, there are 59 constituencies. Until 2013, the Scottish fire brigades and police forces were based on a system of regions introduced in 1975. For healthcare and postal districts, and a number of other governmental and non-governmental organisations such as the churches, there are other long-standing methods of subdividing Scotland for the purposes of administration.

</p>
<p>
<a>City status in the United Kingdom</a> is conferred by <a>letters patent</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_270">[270]</a></sup> There are seven cities in Scotland: <a>Aberdeen</a>, <a>Dundee</a>, <a>Edinburgh</a>, <a>Glasgow</a>, <a>Inverness</a>, <a>Stirling</a> and <a>Perth</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_271">[271]</a></sup>

<p>
Scots law has a basis derived from <a>Roman law</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_272">[272]</a></sup> combining features of both uncodified <a>civil law</a>, dating back to the <i><a>Corpus Juris Civilis</a></i>, and <a>common law</a> with <a>medieval sources</a>. The terms of the Treaty of Union with England in 1707 guaranteed the continued existence of a separate legal system in Scotland from that of England and Wales.<sup><a href="#ref_273">[273]</a></sup> Prior to 1611, there were several regional law systems in Scotland, most notably <a>Udal law</a> in <a>Orkney</a> and <a>Shetland</a>, based on old Norse law. Various other systems derived from common <a>Celtic</a> or <a>Brehon laws</a> survived in the Highlands until the 1800s.<sup><a href="#ref_274">[274]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scots law provides for three types of <a>courts</a> responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and <a>heraldic</a>. The supreme civil court is the <a>Court of Session</a>, although civil <a>appeals</a> can be taken to the <a>Supreme Court of the United Kingdom</a> (or before 1 October 2009, the <a>House of Lords</a>). The <a>High Court of Justiciary</a> is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at <a>Parliament House</a>, in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union <a>Parliament of Scotland</a> with the <a>High Court of Justiciary</a> and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the <a>Lawnmarket</a>. The <a>sheriff court</a> is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.<sup><a href="#ref_275">[275]</a></sup><a>District courts</a>  were introduced in 1975 for minor offences and small claims. These were gradually replaced by <a>Justice of the Peace Courts</a> from 2008 to 2010. The <a>Court of the Lord Lyon</a> regulates heraldry.

</p>
<p>
For three centuries the Scots legal system was unique for being the only national legal system without a parliament. This ended with the advent of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, which legislates for Scotland. Many features within the system have been preserved. Within criminal law, the Scots legal system is unique in having three possible verdicts: "guilty", "not guilty" and "<i><a>not proven</a></i>".<sup><a href="#ref_276">[276]</a></sup> Both "not guilty" and "not proven" result in an <a>acquittal</a>, typically with no possibility of retrial in accordance with the rule of <a>double jeopardy</a>. There is, however, the possibility of a retrial where new evidence emerges at a later date that might have proven conclusive in the earlier trial at first instance, where the person acquitted subsequently admits the offence or where it can be proved that the acquittal was tainted by an attempt to <a>pervert the course of justice</a> – see the provisions of the <a>Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011</a>. Many laws differ between Scotland and the other parts of the United Kingdom, and many terms differ for certain legal concepts. <a>Manslaughter</a>, in England and Wales, is broadly similar to <a>culpable homicide</a> in Scotland, and arson is called <a>wilful fire raising</a>. Indeed, some acts considered crimes in England and Wales, such as forgery, are not so in Scotland. Procedure also differs. Scots juries, sitting in criminal cases, consist of fifteen jurors, which is three more than is typical in many countries.<sup><a href="#ref_277">[277]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Scottish Prison Service</a> (SPS) manages the prisons in Scotland, which collectively house over 8,500 prisoners.<sup><a href="#ref_278">[278]</a></sup> The <a>Cabinet Secretary for Justice</a> is responsible for the Scottish Prison Service within the Scottish Government.

<p>
Health care in Scotland is mainly provided by <a>NHS Scotland</a>, Scotland's public health care system. This was founded by the <a>National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947</a> (later repealed by the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978) that took effect on 5 July 1948 to coincide with the launch of the NHS in England and Wales. However, even prior to 1948, half of Scotland's landmass was already covered by state-funded health care, provided by the <a>Highlands and Islands Medical Service</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_280">[280]</a></sup> Healthcare policy and funding is the responsibility of the Scottish Government's <a>Health Directorates</a>. The current <a>Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care</a> is <a>Humza Yousaf</a><sup><a href="#ref_281">[281]</a></sup> and the Director-General (DG) Health and chief executive, NHS Scotland is Caroline Lamb.<sup><a href="#ref_282">[282]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff including more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants. There are also more than 12,000 doctors, family practitioners and allied health professionals, including dentists, opticians and community pharmacists, who operate as independent contractors providing a range of services within the NHS in return for fees and allowances. These fees and allowances were removed in May 2010, and prescriptions are entirely free, although dentists and opticians may charge if the patient's household earns over a certain amount, about £30,000 per annum.<sup><a href="#ref_283">[283]</a></sup>

<p>
Scotland has a Western-style <a>open</a><a>mixed economy</a>  closely linked with the rest of the UK and the wider world. Traditionally, the Scottish economy was dominated by <a>heavy industry</a> underpinned by shipbuilding in Glasgow, coal mining and <a>steel industries</a>. Petroleum related industries associated with the extraction of <a>North Sea oil</a> have also been important employers from the 1970s, especially in the north-east of Scotland. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more <a>service</a>-oriented economy.

</p>
<p>
Scotland's gross domestic product (GDP), including oil and gas produced in Scottish waters, was estimated at £150 billion for the calendar year 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_285">[285]</a></sup> In 2014, Scotland's per capita GDP was one of the highest in the EU.<sup><a href="#ref_286">[286]</a></sup> As of April 2019 the Scottish unemployment rate was 3.3%, below the UK's overall rate of 3.8%, and the Scottish employment rate was 75.9%.<sup><a href="#ref_287">[287]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Edinburgh is the financial services centre of Scotland, with many large finance firms based there, including: <a>Lloyds Banking Group</a> (owners of <a>HBOS</a>); the Government-owned <a>Royal Bank of Scotland</a> and <a>Standard Life</a>. Edinburgh was ranked 15th in the <a>list of world financial centres</a> in 2007, but fell to 37th in 2012, following damage to its reputation,<sup><a href="#ref_288">[288]</a></sup> and in 2016 was ranked 56th out of 86.<sup><a href="#ref_289">[289]</a></sup> Its status had returned to 17th however by 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_290">[290]</a></sup>

<p>
In 2014, total Scottish exports (excluding intra-UK trade) were estimated to be £27.5 billion.<sup><a href="#ref_291">[291]</a></sup> Scotland's primary exports include <a>whisky</a>, electronics and financial services.<sup><a href="#ref_292">[292]</a></sup> The United States, Netherlands, Germany, France, and Norway constitute the country's major export markets.<sup><a href="#ref_292">[292]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Whisky is one of Scotland's more known goods of economic activity. Exports increased by 87% in the decade to 2012<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup> and were valued at £4.3 billion in 2013, which was 85% of Scotland's food and drink exports.<sup><a href="#ref_294">[294]</a></sup> It supports around 10,000 jobs directly and 25,000 indirectly.<sup><a href="#ref_295">[295]</a></sup> It may contribute £400–682 million to Scotland, rather than several billion pounds, as more than 80% of whisky produced is owned by non-Scottish companies.<sup><a href="#ref_296">[296]</a></sup> A briefing published in 2002 by the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) for the Scottish Parliament's Enterprise and Life Long Learning Committee stated that tourism accounted for up to 5% of GDP and 7.5% of employment.<sup><a href="#ref_297">[297]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scotland was one of the industrial powerhouses of Europe from the time of the <a>Industrial Revolution</a> onwards, being a world leader in manufacturing.<sup><a href="#ref_298">[298]</a></sup> This left a legacy in the diversity of goods and services which Scotland produces, from textiles, <a>whisky</a> and <a>shortbread</a> to jet engines, buses, computer software, ships, <a>avionics</a> and <a>microelectronics</a>, as well as banking, insurance, <a>investment management</a> and other related financial services.<sup><a href="#ref_299">[299]</a></sup> In common with most other advanced industrialised economies, Scotland has seen a decline in the importance of both manufacturing industries and primary-based extractive industries. This has, however, been combined with a rise in the <a>service</a> sector of the economy, which has grown to be the largest sector in Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_300">[300]</a></sup>

The value of the Scottish banknotes in circulation in 2013 was £3.8 billion, underwritten by the Bank of England using funds deposited by each clearing bank, under the <a>Banking Act 2009</a>, in order to cover the total value of such notes in circulation.<sup><a href="#ref_302">[302]</a></sup>

Of the money spent on UK defence, about £3.3 billion can be attributed to Scotland as of 2018/2019.<sup><a href="#ref_303">[303]</a></sup>

<p>
Scotland had a long military tradition predating the <a>Treaty of Union</a> with England; the <a>Scots Army</a> and <a>Royal Scots Navy</a> were (with the exception of the <a>Atholl Highlanders</a>, Europe's only legal <a>private army</a>) merged with their English counterparts to form the <a>Royal Navy</a> and the <a>British Army</a>, which together form part of the <a>British Armed Forces</a>. Numerous <a>Scottish regiments</a> have at various times existed in the British Army. Distinctively Scottish regiments in the British Army include the <a>Scots Guards</a>, the <a>Royal Scots Dragoon Guards</a> and the <a>154 (Scottish) Regiment RLC</a>, an <a>Army Reserve</a> regiment of the <a>Royal Logistic Corps</a>. In 2006, as a result of the <i><a>Delivering Security in a Changing World</a></i><a>white paper</a> , the Scottish infantry regiments in the <a>Scottish Division</a> were amalgamated to form the <a>Royal Regiment of Scotland</a>. As a result of the <a>Cameron–Clegg coalition</a>'s <a>Strategic Defence and Security Review 2010</a>, the Scottish regiments of the line in the <a>British Army</a><a>infantry</a> , having previously formed the Scottish Division, were reorganised into the <a>Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division</a> in 2017. Before the formation of the Scottish Division, the Scottish infantry was organised into a <a>Lowland Brigade</a> and <a>Highland Brigade</a>.

Because of their topography and perceived remoteness, parts of Scotland have housed many sensitive defence establishments.<sup><a href="#ref_304">[304]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_305">[305]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_306">[306]</a></sup> Between 1960 and 1991, the <a>Holy Loch</a> was a base for the US fleet of <a>Polaris</a><a>ballistic missile submarines</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_307">[307]</a></sup> Today, <a>Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde</a>, 25 miles (40 kilometres) north-west of Glasgow, is the base for the four <a>Trident</a>-armed <a><i> Vanguard</i>-class</a><a>ballistic missile submarines</a>  that comprise the Britain's <a>nuclear deterrent</a>. <a>Scapa Flow</a> was the major <a>Fleet</a> base for the <a>Royal Navy</a> until 1956.

</p>
<p>
Scotland's <a>Scapa Flow</a> was the main base for the <a>Royal Navy</a> in the 20th century.<sup><a href="#ref_308">[308]</a></sup> As the <a>Cold War</a> intensified in 1961, the United States deployed <a>Polaris ballistic missiles</a>, and submarines, in the <a>Firth of Clyde</a>'s <a>Holy Loch</a>. Public protests from <a>CND</a> campaigners proved futile. The Royal Navy successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened with four <a><i> Resolution</i>-class</a> Polaris submarines at the expanded <a>Faslane Naval Base</a> on the <a>Gare Loch</a>. The first patrol of a <a>Trident</a>-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed at the end of the Cold War.<sup><a href="#ref_309">[309]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A single front-line <a>Royal Air Force</a> base is located in Scotland. <a>RAF Lossiemouth</a>, located in <a>Moray</a>, is the most northerly <a>air defence</a><a>fighter</a>  base in the United Kingdom and is home to three fast-jet squadrons equipped with the <a>Eurofighter Typhoon</a>.

<p>
The <a>Scottish education system</a> has always been distinct from the rest of the United Kingdom, with a characteristic emphasis on a <a>broad education</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_310">[310]</a></sup> In the 15th century, the Humanist emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the <a>Education Act 1496</a>, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn "perfyct Latyne", resulting in an increase in literacy among a male and wealthy elite.<sup><a href="#ref_311">[311]</a></sup> In the Reformation, the 1560 <i><a>First Book of Discipline</a></i> set out a plan for a school in every parish, but this proved financially impossible.<sup><a href="#ref_312">[312]</a></sup> In 1616 an <a>act in Privy council</a> commanded every parish to establish a school.<sup><a href="#ref_313">[313]</a></sup> By the late seventeenth century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.<sup><a href="#ref_314">[314]</a></sup> Education remained a matter for the church rather than the state until the <a>Education (Scotland) Act 1872</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_315">[315]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <i><a>Curriculum for Excellence</a></i>, Scotland's national school curriculum, presently provides the curricular framework for children and young people from age 3 to 18.<sup><a href="#ref_316">[316]</a></sup> All 3- and 4-year-old children in Scotland are entitled to a free nursery place. Formal primary education begins at approximately 5 years old and lasts for 7 years (P1–P7); children in Scotland study <a>Standard Grades</a>, or <a>Intermediate</a> qualifications between the ages of 14 and 16. These are being phased out and replaced by the National Qualifications of the <a>Curriculum for Excellence</a>. The school leaving age is 16, after which students may choose to remain at school and study for <a>Access</a>, <a>Intermediate</a> or <a>Higher Grade</a> and <a>Advanced Higher</a> qualifications. A small number of students at certain private, <a>independent schools</a> may follow the <a>English system</a> and study towards <a>GCSEs</a> and <a>A</a> and <a>AS-Levels</a> instead.<sup><a href="#ref_317">[317]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are fifteen <a>Scottish universities</a>, some of which are amongst the <a>oldest in the world</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_318">[318]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_319">[319]</a></sup> The four universities founded before the end of the 16th century – the <a>University of St Andrews</a>, the <a>University of Glasgow</a>, the <a>University of Aberdeen</a> and the <a>University of Edinburgh</a> – are collectively known as the <a>ancient universities of Scotland</a>, all of which rank among the 200 best universities in the world in the <a>THE rankings</a>, with Edinburgh placing in the top 50.<sup><a href="#ref_320">[320]</a></sup> Scotland had more universities per capita in <a>QS' World University Rankings'</a> top 100 in 2012 than any other nation.<sup><a href="#ref_321">[321]</a></sup> The country produces 1% of the world's <a>published research</a> with less than 0.1% of the world's population, and higher education institutions account for 9% of Scotland's service sector exports.<sup><a href="#ref_322">[322]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_323">[323]</a></sup> Scotland's University Courts are the only bodies in Scotland authorised to award degrees.

</p>
<p>
Tuition is handled by the Student Awards Agency Scotland (SAAS), which does not charge fees to what it defines as "Young Students". Young Students are defined as those under 25, without children, marriage, civil partnership or cohabiting partner, who have not been outside of full-time education for more than three years. Fees exist for those outside the young student definition, typically from £1,200 to £1,800 for undergraduate courses, dependent on year of application and type of qualification. Postgraduate fees can be up to £3,400.<sup><a href="#ref_324">[324]</a></sup> The system has been in place since 2007 when graduate endowments were abolished.<sup><a href="#ref_325">[325]</a></sup> Labour's education spokesperson <a>Rhona Brankin</a> criticised the Scottish system for failing to address student poverty.<sup><a href="#ref_326">[326]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scotland's universities are complemented in the provision of Further and Higher Education by 43 colleges. Colleges offer National Certificates, Higher National Certificates, and Higher National Diplomas. These Group Awards, alongside Scottish Vocational Qualifications, aim to ensure Scotland's population has the appropriate skills and knowledge to meet workplace needs. In 2014, research reported by the <a>Office for National Statistics</a> found that Scotland was the most highly educated country in Europe and among the most well-educated in the world in terms of tertiary education attainment, with roughly 40% of people in Scotland aged 16–64 educated to <a>NVQ level 4</a> and above.<sup><a href="#ref_327">[327]</a></sup> Based on the original data for <a>EU statistical regions</a>, all four Scottish regions ranked significantly above the European average for completion of tertiary-level education by 25- to 64-year-olds.<sup><a href="#ref_328">[328]</a></sup>

<p>
<a>Scottish music</a> is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the <a>Great Highland bagpipe</a>, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. <a>Bagpipe bands</a>, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing Scottish music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The <a>clàrsach</a> (harp), <a>fiddle</a> and <a>accordion</a> are also traditional Scottish instruments, the latter two heavily featured in <a>Scottish country dance</a> bands. There are many successful Scottish bands and individual artists in varying styles including <a>Annie Lennox</a>, <a>Amy Macdonald</a>, <a>Runrig</a>, <a>Belle and Sebastian</a>, <a>Boards of Canada</a>, <a>Camera Obscura</a>, <a>Cocteau Twins</a>, <a>Deacon Blue</a>, <a>Franz Ferdinand</a>, <a>Susan Boyle</a>, <a>Emeli Sandé</a>, <a>Texas</a>, <a>The View</a>, <a>The Fratellis</a>, <a>Twin Atlantic</a> and <a>Biffy Clyro</a>. Other Scottish musicians include <a>Shirley Manson</a>, <a>Paolo Nutini</a>, <a>Andy Stewart</a> and <a>Calvin Harris</a>, all of whom have achieved considerable commercial success in international music markets<sup><a href="#ref_329">[329]</a></sup> Shirley Manson performed at the 1999 opening of the <a>Scottish Parliament</a> concert at <a>Princes Street Gardens</a> with her band <a>Garbage</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_330">[330]</a></sup>

Scotland has a literary heritage dating back to the early Middle Ages. The earliest extant literature composed in what is now Scotland was in <a>Brythonic</a> speech in the 6th century, but is preserved as part of <a>Welsh literature</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_333">[333]</a></sup> Later medieval literature included works in Latin,<sup><a href="#ref_334">[334]</a></sup> Gaelic,<sup><a href="#ref_335">[335]</a></sup> Old English<sup><a href="#ref_336">[336]</a></sup> and French.<sup><a href="#ref_337">[337]</a></sup> The first surviving major text in <a>Early Scots</a> is the 14th-century poet <a>John Barbour</a>'s epic <i><a>Brus</a></i>, focusing on the life of Robert I,<sup><a href="#ref_338">[338]</a></sup> and was soon followed by a series of vernacular romances and prose works.<sup><a href="#ref_339">[339]</a></sup> In the 16th century, the crown's patronage helped the development of Scots drama and poetry,<sup><a href="#ref_340">[340]</a></sup> but the accession of James VI to the English throne removed a major centre of literary patronage and Scots was sidelined as a literary language.<sup><a href="#ref_341">[341]</a></sup> Interest in Scots literature was revived in the 18th century by figures including <a>James Macpherson</a>, whose <a>Ossian Cycle</a> made him the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation and was a major influence on the European Enlightenment.<sup><a href="#ref_342">[342]</a></sup> It was also a major influence on <a>Robert Burns</a>, whom many consider the national poet,<sup><a href="#ref_343">[343]</a></sup> and <a>Walter Scott</a>, whose <a>Waverley Novels</a> did much to define Scottish identity in the 19th century.<sup><a href="#ref_344">[344]</a></sup> Towards the end of the Victorian era a number of Scottish-born authors achieved international reputations as writers in English, including <a>Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, <a>Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a>J. M. Barrie</a> and <a>George MacDonald</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_345">[345]</a></sup> In the 20th century the <a>Scottish Renaissance</a> saw a surge of literary activity and attempts to reclaim the Scots language as a medium for serious literature.<sup><a href="#ref_346">[346]</a></sup> Members of the movement were followed by a new generation of post-war poets including <a>Edwin Morgan</a>, who would be appointed the first <a>Scots Makar</a> by the inaugural Scottish government in 2004.<sup><a href="#ref_347">[347]</a></sup> From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival, particularly associated with a group of writers including <a>Irvine Welsh</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_346">[346]</a></sup> Scottish poets who emerged in the same period included <a>Carol Ann Duffy</a>, who, in May 2009, was the first Scot named the monarch's <a>Poet Laureate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_348">[348]</a></sup>

As one of the <a>Celtic nations</a>, Scotland and Scottish culture are represented at interceltic events at home and over the world.

The image of <a>St. Andrew</a>, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the <a>Kingdom of Scotland</a> during the reign of <a>William I</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_353">[353]</a></sup> Following the death of <a>King Alexander III</a> in 1286 an image of Andrew was used on the <a>seal</a> of the <a>Guardians of Scotland</a> who assumed control of the kingdom during the subsequent <a>interregnum</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_354">[354]</a></sup> Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the <a>saltire</a>, has its origins in the late 14th century; the <a>Parliament of Scotland</a> decreeing in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on the front and back of their tunics.<sup><a href="#ref_355">[355]</a></sup> Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century.<sup><a href="#ref_356">[356]</a></sup> Since 1606 the saltire has also formed part of the design of the <a>Union Flag</a>. There are numerous other symbols and symbolic artefacts, both official and unofficial, including the <a>thistle</a>, the nation's <a>floral emblem</a> (celebrated in the song, <a>The Thistle o' Scotland</a>), the <a>Declaration of Arbroath</a>, incorporating a statement of political independence made on 6 April 1320, the textile pattern <a>tartan</a> that often signifies a particular <a>Scottish clan</a> and the royal <a>Lion Rampant</a> flag.<sup><a href="#ref_357">[357]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_358">[358]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_359">[359]</a></sup> Highlanders can thank <a>James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose</a>, for the repeal in 1782 of the Act of 1747 prohibiting the wearing of tartans.<sup><a href="#ref_360">[360]</a></sup>

Scottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider <a>British</a> and <a>European cuisine</a> as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of <a>game</a>, dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of <a>spices</a> from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive. <a>Irn-Bru</a> is the most common Scottish carbonated soft drink, often described as "Scotland's other national drink" (after whisky).<sup><a href="#ref_367">[367]</a></sup> During the <a>Late Middle Ages</a> and <a>early modern era</a>, <a>French cuisine</a> played a role in Scottish cookery due to cultural exchanges brought about by the "<a>Auld Alliance</a>",<sup><a href="#ref_368">[368]</a></sup> especially during the reign of <a>Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. Mary, on her return to Scotland, brought an entourage of French staff who are considered responsible for revolutionising Scots cooking and for some of Scotland's unique food terminology.<sup><a href="#ref_369">[369]</a></sup>

The world's first official international association football match was held in 1872 and was the idea of <a>C. W.

Edinburgh Airport is currently Scotland's busiest airport handling over 13 million passengers in 2017.<sup><a href="#ref_408">[408]</a></sup> It is also the UK's 6th busiest airport.

</p>
<p>
<a>British Airways</a>, <a>easyJet</a>, <a>flybe</a>, <a>Jet2</a>, and <a>Ryanair</a> operate the majority of flights between Scotland and other major UK and European airports.

</p>
<p>
Four airlines are based in Scotland:

<p>
<a>Network Rail</a> owns and operates the fixed infrastructure assets of the railway system in Scotland, while the Scottish Government retains overall responsibility for rail strategy and funding in Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_409">[409]</a></sup> Scotland's rail network has 359 railway stations and around 1,710 miles (2,760 km) of track.<sup><a href="#ref_410">[410]</a></sup> In 2018–19 there were 102<span></span>million passenger journeys on Scottish railways.<sup><a href="#ref_411">[411]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>East Coast</a> and <a>West Coast</a> main railway lines connect the major cities and towns of Scotland with each other and with the rail network in England. <a>London North Eastern Railway</a> provides inter-city rail journeys between <a>Glasgow</a>, <a>Edinburgh</a>, <a>Aberdeen</a> and <a>Inverness</a> to London. Domestic rail services within Scotland are operated by <a>Abellio ScotRail</a>. During the time of <a>British Rail</a>, the West Coast Main Line from <a>London Euston</a> to <a>Glasgow Central</a> was electrified in the early 1970s, followed by the East Coast Main Line in the late 1980s. British Rail created the <a>ScotRail brand</a>. When British Rail existed, many railway lines in Strathclyde were electrified. Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive was at the forefront with the acclaimed "largest electrified rail network outside London". Some parts of the network are electrified, but there are no electrified lines in the Highlands, Angus, Aberdeenshire, the cities of Dundee or Aberdeen, or Perth & Kinross, and none of the islands has a rail link (although the railheads at <a>Kyle of Lochalsh</a> and <a>Mallaig</a> principally serve the islands).

</p>
<p>
The East Coast Main Line crosses the <a>Firth of Forth</a> by the <a>Forth Bridge</a>. Completed in 1890, this <a>cantilever bridge</a> has been described as "the one internationally recognised Scottish landmark".<sup><a href="#ref_412">[412]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>page needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Scotland's rail network is managed by Transport Scotland.<sup><a href="#ref_413">[413]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Scottish motorways and major <a>trunk roads</a> are managed by <a>Transport Scotland</a>. The remainder of the road network is managed by the <a>Scottish local authorities</a> in each of their areas.

</p>
<p>
Regular ferry services operate between the Scottish mainland and outlying islands. Ferries serving both the inner and outer <a>Hebrides</a> are principally operated by the <a>state-owned enterprise</a><a>Caledonian MacBrayne</a> .

</p>
<p>
Services to the <a>Northern Isles</a> are operated by <a>Serco</a>. Other routes, served by multiple companies, connect southwest Scotland to <a>Northern Ireland</a>. <a>DFDS Seaways</a> operated a freight-only <a>Rosyth – Zeebrugge ferry service</a>, until a fire damaged the vessel DFDS were using.<sup><a href="#ref_414">[414]</a></sup> A passenger service was also operated between 2002 and 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_415">[415]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Additional routes are operated by local authorities.
