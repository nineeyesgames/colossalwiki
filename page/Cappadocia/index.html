<p>
Since the late 300s BC the name Cappadocia came to be restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), Upper Cappadocia, which alone will be the focus of this article. Lower Cappadocia is focused to elsewhere.

</p>
<p>
According to <a>Herodotus</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> in the time of the <a>Ionian Revolt</a> (499 BC), the Cappadocians were reported as occupying a region from <a>Mount Taurus</a> to the vicinity of the Euxine (<a>Black Sea</a>). Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in the south by the chain of the <a>Taurus Mountains</a> that separate it from <a>Cilicia</a>, to the east by the upper <a>Euphrates</a>, to the north by <a>Pontus</a>, and to the west by <a>Lycaonia</a> and eastern <a>Galatia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The name, traditionally used in Christian sources throughout history, continues in use as an international <a>tourism</a> concept to define a region of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by <a>fairy chimneys</a> and a unique <a>historical</a> and <a>cultural</a> heritage.

<p>
The earliest record of the name of Cappadocia dates from the late 6th century <a>BC</a>, when it appears in the trilingual inscriptions of two early <a>Achaemenid</a> kings, <a>Darius I</a> and <a>Xerxes</a>, as one of the countries (<a>Old Persian</a><i>dahyu-</i> ) of the <a>Persian Empire</a>.  In these lists of countries, the Old Persian name is <i>Katpatuka</i>. It was proposed that <i>Kat-patuka</i> came from the <a>Luwian language</a>, meaning "Low Country".<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> Subsequent research suggests that the adverb <i>katta</i> meaning 'down, below' is exclusively <a>Hittite</a>, while its Luwian equivalent is <i>zanta</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> Therefore, the recent modification of this proposal operates with the Hittite <i>katta peda-</i>, literally "place below" as a starting point for the development of the <a>toponym</a> Cappadocia.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> The earlier derivation from Iranian <i>Hu-aspa-dahyu</i> 'Land of good horses' can hardly be reconciled with the phonetic shape of <i>Kat-patuka</i>. A number of other etymologies have also been offered in the past.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Herodotus</a> tells us that the name of the Cappadocians was applied to them by the <a>Persians</a>, while they were termed by the <a>Greeks</a> "White Syrians" (<i><a>Leucosyri</a></i>),<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> who were most probably descendants of the <a>Hittites</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> One of the Cappadocian tribes he mentions is the <a>Moschoi</a>, associated by <a>Flavius Josephus</a> with the biblical figure <a>Meshech</a>, son of <a>Japheth</a>: "and the Mosocheni were founded by Mosoch; now they are Cappadocians". <a>AotJ</a> I:6.

<p>
Cappadocia appears in the <a>biblical</a> account given in the book of <a>Acts 2:9</a>. The Cappadocians were named as one group hearing the <a>Gospel</a> account from <a>Galileans</a> in their own language on the day of <a>Pentecost</a> shortly after the <a>resurrection</a> of <a>Jesus</a> Christ. <a>Acts 2:5</a> seems to suggest that the Cappadocians in this account were "God-fearing <a>Jews</a>". See <a>Acts of the Apostles</a>.

</p>
<p>
The region is also mentioned in the Jewish <a>Mishnah</a>, in <a>Ketubot</a> 13:11, and in several places in the <a>Talmud</a>, including <a>Yevamot</a> 121a.

</p>
<p>
Under the later kings of the Persian Empire, the Cappadocians were divided into two <a>satrapies</a>, or governments, with one comprising the central and inland portion, to which the name of Cappadocia continued to be applied by <a>Greek geographers</a>, while the other was called <a>Pontus</a>. This division had already come about before the time of <a>Xenophon</a>. As after the fall of the Persian government the two provinces continued to be separate, the distinction was perpetuated, and the name Cappadocia came to be restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia), which alone will be the focus of this article.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The kingdom of Cappadocia still existed in the time of <a>Strabo</a> (c. 64 BC – c. AD 24 ) as a nominally independent state. <a>Cilicia</a> was the name given to the district in which <a>Caesarea</a>, the capital of the whole country, was situated. The only two cities of Cappadocia considered by Strabo to deserve that appellation were <a>Caesarea</a> (originally known as <a>Mazaca</a>) and <a>Tyana</a>, not far from the foot of the <a>Taurus</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>

<p>
Cappadocia lies in central <a>Anatolia</a>, in the heartland of what is now Turkey.  The relief consists of a high plateau over 1000 m in altitude that is pierced by volcanic peaks, with <a>Mount Erciyes</a> (ancient Argaeus) near <a>Kayseri</a> (ancient Caesarea) being the tallest at <span>3916 m</span>. The boundaries of historical Cappadocia are vague, particularly towards the west. To the south, the Taurus Mountains form the boundary with <a>Cilicia</a> and separate Cappadocia from the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>. To the west, Cappadocia is bounded by the historical regions of Lycaonia to the southwest, and <a>Galatia</a> to the northwest.  Due to its inland location and high altitude, Cappadocia has a markedly continental climate, with hot dry summers and cold snowy winters.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Rainfall is sparse and the region is largely semi-arid.

</p>
<p>
Cappadocia contained the sources of the <a>Sarus</a> and <a>Pyramus</a> rivers with their higher affluents, and also the middle course of the <a>Halys</a>, and the whole course of the tributary of the <a>Euphrates</a> later called Tokhma Su. But as no one of these rivers was navigable or served to fertilize the lands along its course, none has much importance in the history of the province.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>

Cappadocia was known as <a>Hatti</a> in the late <a>Bronze Age</a>, and was the homeland of the <a>Hittite</a> power centred at <a>Hattusa</a>. After the fall of the Hittite Empire, with the decline of the Syro-Cappadocians (<a>Mushki</a>) after their defeat by the <a>Lydian</a> king <a>Croesus</a> in the 6th century BC, Cappadocia was ruled by a sort of <a>feudal</a> aristocracy, dwelling in strong castles and keeping the peasants in a servile condition, which later made them apt to foreign slavery. It was included in the third <a>Persian</a><a>satrapy</a>  in the division established by <a>Darius</a> but continued to be governed by rulers of its own, none apparently supreme over the whole country and all more or less tributaries of the <a>Great King</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>
After ending the Persian Empire, <a>Alexander the Great</a> tried to rule the area through one of his military commanders. But <a>Ariarathes</a>, previously satrap of the region, declared himself king of the Cappadocians. As Ariarathes I (332–322 BC), he was a successful ruler, and he extended the borders of the Cappadocian Kingdom as far as to the <a>Black Sea</a>. The kingdom of Cappadocia lived in peace until the death of Alexander. The previous empire was then divided into many parts, and Cappadocia fell to <a>Eumenes</a>. His claims were made good in 322 BC by the regent <a>Perdiccas</a>, who crucified Ariarathes; but in the dissensions which brought about Eumenes's death, <a>Ariarathes II</a>, the adopted son of Ariarathes I, recovered his inheritance and left it to a line of successors, who mostly bore the name of the founder of the <a>dynasty</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Persian colonists in the Cappadocian kingdom, cut off from their co-religionists in Iran proper, continued to practice <a>Zoroastrianism</a>. <a>Strabo</a>, observing them in the first century BC, records (XV.3.15) that these "fire kindlers" possessed many "holy places of the Persian Gods", as well as <a>fire temples</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> Strabo furthermore relates, were "noteworthy enclosures; and in their midst there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes and where the magi keep the fire ever burning."<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> According to Strabo, who wrote during the time of <a>Augustus</a> (r. 63 BC–14 AD), almost three hundred years after the fall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, there remained only traces of Persians in western <a>Asia Minor</a>; however, he considered Cappadocia "almost a living part of Persia".<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Under <a>Ariarathes IV</a>, Cappadocia came into relations with <a>Rome</a>, first as a foe espousing the cause of <a>Antiochus the Great</a>, then as an ally against <a>Perseus of Macedon</a>. The kings henceforward threw in their lot with the Republic as against the <a>Seleucids</a>, to whom they had been from time to time tributary. <a>Ariarathes V</a> marched with the Roman <a>proconsul</a><a>Publius Licinius Crassus Dives Mucianus</a>  against <a>Aristonicus</a>, a claimant to the throne of <a>Pergamon</a>, and their forces were annihilated (130 BC). The imbroglio which followed his death ultimately led to interference by the rising power of <a>Pontus</a> and the intrigues and wars which ended in the failure of the dynasty.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>
The Cappadocians, supported by Rome against <a>Mithridates VI of Pontus</a>, elected a native lord, <a>Ariobarzanes</a>, to succeed (93 BC); but in the same year <a>Armenian</a> troops under <a>Tigranes the Great</a> entered Cappadocia, dethroned king Ariobarzanes and crowned <a>Gordios</a> as the new <a>client-king</a> of Cappadocia, thus creating a buffer zone against the encroaching Romans. It was not until Rome had deposed the Pontic and Armenian kings that the rule of Ariobarzanes was established (63 BC). In the civil wars Cappadocia was first for <a>Pompey</a>, then for <a>Caesar</a>, then for <a>Antony</a>, and finally, <a>Octavian</a>. The Ariobarzanes dynasty came to an end, a Cappadocian nobleman <a>Archelaus</a> was given the throne, by favour first of Antony and then of Octavian, and maintained tributary independence until AD 17, when the emperor <a>Tiberius</a>, whom he had angered, summoned him to Rome and reduced Cappadocia to a Roman province.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 70 AD, <a>Vespasian</a> joined <a>Armenia Minor</a> to Cappadocia, and made the combined province a frontier bulwark. It remained, under various provincial redistributions, part of the <a>Eastern Empire</a> for centuries.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Cappadocia contains several <a>underground cities</a> (see <a>Kaymaklı Underground City</a>). The underground cities have vast defence networks of traps throughout their many levels. These traps are very creative, including such devices as large round stones to block doors and holes in the ceiling through which the defenders may drop spears.

<p>
In 314, Cappadocia was the largest province of the Roman Empire, and was part of the <a>Diocese of Pontus</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The region suffered <a>famine</a> in 368 described as "the most severe ever remembered" by <a>Gregory of Nazianzus</a>:

</p>
<p>
This is similar to another account by <a>Gregory of Nyssa</a> that <a>Basil</a> "ungrudgingly spent upon the poor his patriomny even before he was a priest, and most of all in the time of the famine, during which [Basil] was a ruler of the Church, though still a priest in the rank of presbyters; and afterwards did not hoard even what remained to him".<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 371, the western part of the Cappadocia province was divided into Cappadocia Prima, with its capital at Caesarea (modern-day Kayseri); and Cappadocia Secunda, with its capital at <a>Tyana</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> By 386, the region to the east of Caesarea had become part of Armenia Secunda, while the northeast had become part of Armenia Prima.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Cappadocia largely consisted of major estates, owned by the Roman emperors or wealthy local families.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The Cappadocian provinces became more important in the latter part of the 4th century, as the Romans were involved with the <a>Sasanian Empire</a> over control of <a>Mesopotamia</a> and "Armenia beyond the Euphrates".<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Cappadocia, now well into the Roman era, still retained a significant <a>Iranian</a> character; Stephen Mitchell notes in the <i>Oxford Dictionary of Late Antiquity</i>: "Many inhabitants of Cappadocia were of <a>Persian</a> descent and Iranian fire worship is attested as late as 465".<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Cappadocian Fathers</a> of the 4th century were integral to much of early <a>Christian philosophy</a>. It also produced, among other people, another <a>Patriarch of Constantinople</a>, <a>John of Cappadocia</a>, who held office 517–520. For most of the <a>Byzantine</a> era it remained relatively undisturbed by the conflicts in the area with the Sassanid Empire, but was a vital frontier zone later against the <a>Muslim conquests</a>. From the 7th century, Cappadocia was divided between the <a>Anatolic</a> and <a>Armeniac</a><a>themes</a> . In the 9th–11th centuries, the region comprised the themes of <a>Charsianon</a> and <a>Cappadocia</a>.

</p>
<p>
Cappadocia shared an always-changing relationship with neighbouring <a>Armenia</a>, by that time a region of the Empire. The <a>Arab</a> historian <a>Abu Al Faraj</a> asserts the following about <a>Armenian</a> settlers in <a>Sivas</a>, during the 10th century: "Sivas, in Cappadocia, was dominated by the Armenians and their numbers became so many that they became vital members of the imperial armies. These Armenians were used as watch-posts in strong fortresses, taken from the Arabs. They distinguished themselves as experienced infantry soldiers in the imperial army and were constantly fighting with outstanding courage and success by the side of the Romans in other words Byzantine".<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> As a result of the Byzantine military campaigns and the <a>Seljuk</a> invasion of Armenia, the Armenians spread into Cappadocia and eastward from <a>Cilicia</a> into the mountainous areas of northern <a>Syria</a> and <a>Mesopotamia</a>, and the <a>Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia</a> was eventually formed. This immigration was increased further after the decline of the local imperial power and the establishment of the <a>Crusader States</a> following the <a>Fourth Crusade</a>. To the crusaders, Cappadocia was "terra Hermeniorum," the land of the Armenians, due to the large number of Armenians settled there.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>

<p>
Following the <a>Battle of Manzikert</a> in 1071, various <a>Turkish</a><a>clans</a>  under the leadership of the <a>Seljuks</a> began settling in <a>Anatolia</a>. With the rise of Turkish power in Anatolia, Cappadocia slowly became a tributary to the Turkish states that were established to the east and to the west; some of the native population converted to Islam<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> with the rest forming the remaining <a>Cappadocian Greek</a> population. By the end of the early 12th century, <a>Anatolian Seljuks</a> had established their sole dominance over the region. With the decline and the fall of the <a>Konya</a>-based Seljuks in the second half of the 13th century, they were gradually replaced by successive Turkic ruled states: the <a>Karaman</a>-based <a>Beylik</a> of <a>Karaman</a> and then the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>. Cappadocia remained part of the Ottoman Empire until 1922, when it became part of the modern state of <a>Turkey</a>. A fundamental change occurred in between when a new urban center, <a>Nevşehir</a>, was founded in the early 18th century by a <a>grand vizier</a> who was a native of the locality (<a>Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha</a>), to serve as regional capital, a role the city continues to assume to this day.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> In the meantime many former Cappadocians had shifted to a Turkish dialect (written in <a>Greek alphabet</a>, <i><a>Karamanlıca</a></i>), and where the <a>Greek language</a> was maintained (Sille, villages near Kayseri, Pharasa town and other nearby villages), it became heavily influenced by the surrounding Turkish. This dialect of <a>Eastern Roman</a> Greek is known as <i><a>Cappadocian Greek</a></i>. Following the foundation of Turkey in 1922, those who still identified with this pre-Islamic culture of Cappadocia were <a>required to leave</a>, so this language is now only spoken by a handful of their descendants, most now located in modern Greece.

<p>
The area is a popular tourist destination, as it has many areas with unique geological, historic, and cultural features.

</p>
<p>
Touristic Cappadocia includes 4 cities: Nevşehir, Kayseri, Aksaray and Niğde.

</p>
<p>
The region is located southwest of the major city <a>Kayseri</a>, which has <a>airline</a> and <a>railway</a> service to <a>Ankara</a> and <a>Istanbul</a> and other cities.

</p>
<p>
The most important towns and destinations in Cappadocia are <a>Ürgüp</a>, <a>Göreme</a>, Ihlara Valley, <a>Selime</a>, Guzelyurt, <a>Uçhisar</a>, Avanos and Zelve. Among the most visited underground cities are <a>Derinkuyu</a>, <a>Kaymakli</a>, Gaziemir and <a>Ozkonak</a>. The best historic mansions and cave houses for tourist stays are in Ürgüp, Göreme, Guzelyurt and Uçhisar.

</p>
<p>
<a>Hot-air ballooning</a> is very popular in Cappadocia and is available in Göreme. <a>Trekking</a> is enjoyed in Ihlara Valley, Monastery Valley (Guzelyurt), Ürgüp and Göreme.

</p>
<p>
Sedimentary rocks formed in lakes and streams and <a>ignimbrite</a> deposits that erupted from ancient volcanoes approximately 9 to <span>3 million</span> years ago, during the late <a>Miocene</a> to <a>Pliocene</a> epochs, underlie the Cappadocia region. The rocks of Cappadocia near Göreme eroded into hundreds of spectacular pillars and <a>minaret</a>-like forms. People of the villages at the heart of the Cappadocia Region carved out houses, churches and monasteries from the soft rocks of volcanic deposits. Göreme became a monastic centre in 300–1200 AD.

</p>
<p>
The first period of settlement in Göreme goes back to the <a>Roman period</a>. The Yusuf Koç, Ortahane, Durmus Kadir and Bezirhane churches in Göreme, and houses and churches carved into rocks in the Uzundere, Bağıldere and Zemi Valleys, all illustrate history and can be seen today. The <a>Göreme Open Air Museum</a> is the most visited site of the monastic communities in Cappadocia (see <a>Churches of Göreme, Turkey</a>) and is one of the most famous sites in central Turkey. The complex contains more than 30 carved-from-rock churches and <a>chapels</a>, some having superb <a>frescoes</a> inside, dating from the 9th century to the 11th century.

</p>
<h2 id="Mesothelioma">Mesothelioma</h2>

In 1975, a study of three small villages in central Cappadocia—Tuzköy, Karain and Sarıhıdır—found that <a>mesothelioma</a> was causing 50% of all deaths. Initially, this was attributed to <a>erionite</a>, a <a>zeolite</a> mineral with similar properties to <a>asbestos</a>, but detailed epidemiological investigation demonstrated that the substance causes the disease mostly in families with a genetic predisposition to mineral fiber carcinogenesis. The studies are being extended to other parts of the region.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>

The area was featured in several films due to its topography. The 1983 Italian/French/Turkish film <i><a>Yor, the Hunter from the Future</a></i> and 1985's <i><a>Land of Doom</a></i> were filmed in Cappadocia. The region was used for the 1989 science fiction film <i><a>Slipstream</a></i> to depict a cult of wind worshippers. In 2010 and early 2011, the film <i><a>Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance</a></i> was also filmed in the Cappadocia region.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup><a>Pier Paolo Pasolini</a> 's  <i><a>Medea</a></i>, based on the plot of Euripides' Medea, was filmed in <a>Göreme</a> Open Air Museum's early Christian churches.

Cappadocia's winter landscapes and broad panoramas are prominent in the 2014 film <i><a>Winter Sleep</a></i> (Turkish: Kış Uykusu), directed by <a>Nuri Bilge Ceylan</a>, which won the <a>Palme d'Or</a> at the 2014 <a>Cannes film festival</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>

Since 2012, a <a>multiday</a><a>track running</a><a>ultramarathon</a>   of desert concept, called <a>Runfire Cappadocia Ultramarathon</a>, is held annually in July. The race tours 244 km (152 mi) in six days through several places across Cappadocia reaching out to <a>Lake Tuz</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
Between September 9 and September 13, 2016, for the first time, the Turkish Presidential Bike Tour took place in Cappadocia where more than 300 cyclists from around the globe participated.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>

It has also been proposed that <i>Katpatuka</i> is a Persianized form of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language">Hittite</a> name for Cilicia, <i>Kizzuwatna</i>, or that it is otherwise of Hittite or Luwian origin (by Tischler and Del Monte, mentioned in Schmitt (1980)). According to A.
