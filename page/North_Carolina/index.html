<b>North Carolina</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˌ</span><span>k</span><span>ær</span><span>ə</span><span>ˈ</span><span>l</span><span>aɪ</span><span>n</span><span>ə</span></span>/</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span></span>) is a <a>state</a> in the <a>Southeastern</a> region of the United States. North Carolina is the <a>28th largest</a> and <a>9th-most populous</a> of the <a>50 United States</a>. It is bordered by <a>Virginia</a> to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, <a>Georgia</a> and <a>South Carolina</a> to the south, and <a>Tennessee</a> to the west. <a>Raleigh</a> is the state's <a>capital</a> and <a>Charlotte</a> is its largest city. The <a>Charlotte metropolitan area</a>, with an estimated population of 2,569,213 in 2018, is the most-populous <a>metropolitan area</a> in North Carolina, the <a>23rd-most populous</a> in the United States, and the largest banking center in the nation after <a>New York City</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> The <a>Raleigh-Durham-Cary combined statistical area</a> is the second-largest metropolitan area in the state, with an estimated population of 2,079,687 in 2019, and is home to the largest research park in the United States, <a>Research Triangle Park</a>.

</p>
<p>
Earliest discoveries of human occupation in North Carolina date back to 10,000 years ago, found at the <a>Hardaway Site</a>. North Carolina was inhabited by <a>Carolina Algonquian</a>, <a>Iroquoian</a>, and <a>Siouan</a> speaking tribes of <a>Native Americans</a> prior to the arrival of Europeans. North Carolina was established as a <a>royal colony</a> in 1729 and was one of the <a>Thirteen Colonies</a>. North Carolina is named in honor of King <a>Charles I of England</a> who first formed the English colony, <i>Carolus</i> being Latin for "Charles". The <a>Halifax Resolves</a> resolution adopted by North Carolina on April 12, 1776, was the first formal call for independence from Great Britain among the American Colonies during the <a>American Revolution</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the 12th state to ratify the <a>United States constitution</a>. In the run-up to the <a>American Civil War</a>, North Carolina declared its <a>secession</a> from the <a>Union</a> on May 20, 1861, becoming the tenth of eleven states to join the <a>Confederate States of America</a>. Following the Civil War, the state was restored to the Union on July 4, 1868.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> On December 17, 1903, <a>Orville and Wilbur Wright</a> successfully piloted the world's first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, <a>heavier-than-air aircraft</a> at <a>Kitty Hawk</a> in North Carolina's <a>Outer Banks</a>. North Carolina uses the slogan "First in Flight" on state <a>license plates</a> to commemorate this achievement, alongside a newer alternative design bearing the slogan "First in Freedom" in reference to the <a>Mecklenburg Declaration</a> and <a>Halifax Resolves</a>.

<p>
North Carolina is defined by a wide range of elevations and landscapes. From west to east, North Carolina's elevation descends from the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a> to the <a>Piedmont</a> and <a>Atlantic coastal plain</a>. North Carolina's <a>Mount Mitchell</a> at 6,684 feet (2,037<span></span>m) is the highest point in North America east of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Most of the state falls in the <a>humid subtropical climate</a> zone; however, the western, mountainous part of the state has a <a>subtropical highland climate</a>.

<p>
North Carolina was inhabited for at least ten thousand years by succeeding <a>prehistoric</a><a>indigenous</a>  cultures. The <a>Hardaway Site</a> saw major periods of occupation dating to 10,000 years BCE. Before 200 AD, the people were building <a>earthwork</a><a>platform mounds</a> , which were used for ceremonial and religious purposes. Succeeding peoples, including those of the <a>South Appalachian Mississippian culture</a>, established by 1000 AD in the <a>Piedmont</a> and mountain region, continued to build this style of mounds. In contrast to some of the larger centers of the classic Mississippian culture (as noted below), in what became known as the western Carolinas, northeastern Georgia and southeastern Tennessee, most of the larger towns had only one central platform mound. The smaller settlements had none but developed close to the more prominent towns. This area became known as the homelands of the historic Cherokee people, who are believed to have migrated over time from the <a>Great Lakes</a> area.

</p>
<p>
In the 500–700 years preceding European contact, the Mississippian culture built large, complex cities and maintained far-flung regional trading networks. Its largest city was <a>Cahokia</a>, which had numerous mounds for different purposes, a highly stratified society, and was located in present-day southwestern Illinois near the Mississippi River. The Native polities of the Mississippian culture fell apart and reformed as new groups, such as the <a>Catawba</a>, due to a series of destabilizing events known as the "Mississippian shatter zone". As described by anthropologist Robbie Ethridge, the Mississippian shatter zone was an area of great instability, in what is now the American South, caused by the instability of Mississippian chiefdoms, high mortality from new Eurasian diseases, construction of a global capitalistic economy based on trading of Native American slaves, and the emergence of Native "militaristic slaving societies".<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Historically documented tribes in the North Carolina region include the <a>Carolina Algonquian</a>-speaking tribes of the coastal areas, such as the <a>Chowanoke</a>, <a>Roanoke</a>, <a>Pamlico</a>, <a>Machapunga</a>, <a>Coree</a>, and <a>Cape Fear Indians</a>, who were the first encountered by the English; the <a>Iroquoian</a>-speaking <a>Meherrin</a>, <a>Cherokee</a>, and <a>Tuscarora</a> of the interior; and Southeastern <a>Siouan</a> tribes, such as the <a>Cheraw</a>, <a>Waxhaw</a>, <a>Saponi</a>, <a>Waccamaw</a>, and <a>Catawba</a> of the Piedmont.

</p>
<p>
In the late 16th century, the first Spanish <a>explorers</a> traveling inland recorded meeting  <a>Mississippian culture</a> people at <a>Joara</a>, a regional <a>chiefdom</a> near what later developed as <a>Morganton</a>. Records of <a>Hernando de Soto</a> attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567, Captain <a>Juan Pardo</a> led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to reach silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed <i>Cuenca</i>. His expedition built <a>Fort San Juan</a> and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further. His forces built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to <a>Santa Elena</a> on <a>Parris Island, South Carolina</a>, then a center of <a>Spanish Florida</a>. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the Spanish soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera, and <a>archaeological</a> findings since 1986 at Joara, have confirmed the settlement.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>

In 1584, <a>Elizabeth I</a> granted a charter to <a>Sir Walter Raleigh</a>, for whom the state capital is named, for land in present-day North Carolina (then part of the territory of <a>Virginia</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> It was the second American territory which the English attempted to colonize. Raleigh established two colonies on the coast in the late 1580s, but both failed. The fate of the "<a>Lost Colony</a>" of <a>Roanoke Island</a> remains one of the most widely debated mysteries of American history. <a>Virginia Dare</a>, the first English child to be born in North America, was born on Roanoke Island on August 18, 1587; <a>Dare County</a> is named for her.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/75/The_Carte_of_all_the_Coast_of_Virginia_by_Theodor_de_Bry_1585_1586.jpg/220px-The_Carte_of_all_the_Coast_of_Virginia_by_Theodor_de_Bry_1585_1586.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
As early as 1650, settlers from the <a>Virginia colony</a> had moved into the area of <a>Albemarle Sound</a>. By 1663, King <a>Charles II of England</a> granted a charter to start a new colony on the North American continent; this would generally establish North Carolina's borders. He named it <i>Carolina</i> in honor of his father, <a>Charles<span></span>I</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> By 1665, a second charter was issued to attempt to resolve territorial questions. In 1710, owing to disputes over governance, the Carolina colony began to split into North Carolina and <a>South Carolina</a>. The latter became a crown colony in 1729.

</p>
<p>
Later in the 1700s, a series of <a>smallpox</a> epidemics swept the South, causing high fatalities among the Native Americans, who had no <a>immunity</a> to the new disease (it had become <a>endemic</a> over centuries in Europe).<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> According to the historian Russell Thornton, "The 1738 epidemic was said to have killed one-half of the <a>Cherokee</a>, with other tribes of the area suffering equally."<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>

<p>
After the Spanish in the 16th century, the first permanent European settlers of North Carolina were English colonists who migrated south from <a>Virginia</a>. The latter had grown rapidly and land was less available. <a>Nathaniel Batts</a> was documented as one of the first of these Virginian migrants. He settled south of the <a>Chowan River</a> and east of the <a>Great Dismal Swamp</a> in 1655.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> By 1663, this northeastern area of the <a>Province of Carolina</a>, known as the <a>Albemarle Settlements</a>, was undergoing full-scale English settlement.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> During the same period, the English monarch Charles<span></span>II gave the province to the <a>Lords Proprietors</a>, a group of noblemen who had helped restore him to the throne in 1660. The new <a>Province of Carolina</a> was named in honor and memory of his father, Charles<span></span>I (Latin: <i>Carolus</i>). A large revolt happened in the state in 1711, known as <a>Cary's Rebellion</a>. In 1712, North Carolina became a separate colony. Except for the <a>Earl Granville</a> holdings, it became a royal colony seventeen years later.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In June 1718, the pirate <a>Blackbeard</a> ran his flagship, the <i><a>Queen Anne's Revenge</a></i>, aground at Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, in present-day <a>Carteret County</a>. After the grounding her crew and supplies were transferred to smaller ships. In November 1718, after appealing to the governor of North Carolina, who promised safe-haven and a pardon, Blackbeard was killed in an ambush by troops from Virginia.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> In 1996 Intersal, Inc., a private firm, discovered the remains of a vessel likely to be the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i>, which was added to the U.S. <a>National Register of Historic Places</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
North Carolina became one of the English <a>Thirteen Colonies</a> and with the territory of <a>South Carolina</a> was originally known as the <a>Province of North Carolina</a>. The northern and southern parts of the original province separated in 1729. Originally settled by small farmers, sometimes having a few slaves, who were oriented toward <a>subsistence agriculture</a>, the colony lacked large cities or towns. <a>Pirates</a> menaced the coastal settlements, but by 1718 the pirates had been captured and killed. Growth was strong in the middle of the 18th century, as the economy attracted <a>Scots-Irish</a>, <a>Quaker</a>, <a>English</a> and <a>German</a><a>immigrants</a> . A majority of the North Carolina colonists generally supported the <a>American Revolution</a>, although there were a small number of <a>Loyalists</a>. Loyalists in North Carolina were smaller in number than in some other colonies such as Georgia, South Carolina, Delaware, and New York.

</p>
<p>
During colonial times, <a>Edenton</a> served as the state capital beginning in 1722, followed by <a>New Bern</a> becoming the capital in 1766. Construction of <a>Tryon Palace</a>, which served as the residence and offices of the provincial governor <a>William Tryon</a>, began in 1767 and was completed in 1771. In 1788, <a>Raleigh</a> was chosen as the site of the new capital, as its central location protected it from coastal attacks. Officially established in 1792 as both county seat and state capital, the city was named after Sir <a>Walter Raleigh</a>, sponsor of <a>Roanoke</a>, the "lost colony" on <a>Roanoke Island</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> The population of the colony more than quadrupled from 52,000 in 1740 to 270,000 in 1780 from high immigration from Virginia, <a>Maryland</a> and <a>Pennsylvania</a>, plus immigrants from abroad.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Differences in the settlement patterns of eastern and western North Carolina, or the <a>Atlantic coastal plain</a> and uplands, affected the political, economic, and social life of the state from the 18th until the 20th century. Eastern North Carolina was settled chiefly by immigrants from rural England and the <a>Scottish Highlands</a>. The <a>Piedmont</a> upcountry and western mountain region of North Carolina was settled chiefly by <a>Scots-Irish</a>, English, and <a>German</a> Protestants, the so-called "<a>cohee</a>". Arriving during the mid- to late 18th century, the Scots-Irish from what is today Northern Ireland were the largest non-English immigrant group before the Revolution; English indentured servants were overwhelmingly the largest immigrant group before the Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> During the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>, the English and Highland Scots of eastern North Carolina tended to remain loyal to the British Crown, because of longstanding business and personal connections with Great Britain. The English, Welsh, Scots-Irish, and German settlers of western North Carolina tended to favor American independence from Britain.

</p>
<p>
Most of the English colonists had arrived as <a>indentured servants</a>, hiring themselves out as laborers for a fixed period to pay for their passage. In the early years the line between indentured servants and African <a>slaves</a> or laborers was fluid. Some Africans were allowed to earn their freedom before slavery became a lifelong status. Most of the <a>free colored</a> families formed in North Carolina before the Revolution were descended from unions or marriages between free white women and enslaved or free African or African-American men. Because the mothers were free, their children were born free. Many had migrated or were descendants of migrants from colonial Virginia.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in <a>Great Britain</a>, planters imported more slaves, and the state's legal delineations between free and slave status tightened, effectively hardening the latter into a racial caste. The economy's growth and prosperity was based on slave labor, devoted primarily to the production of tobacco.

</p>
<p>
On April 12, 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the <a>Continental Congress</a> to vote for independence from the British Crown, through the <a>Halifax Resolves</a> passed by the <a>North Carolina Provincial Congress</a>. The date of this event is memorialized on the <a>state flag</a> and <a>state seal</a>. Throughout the Revolutionary War, fierce <a>guerrilla warfare</a> erupted between bands of pro-independence and pro-British colonists. In some cases the war was also an excuse to settle private grudges and rivalries.

</p>
<p>
During the <a>Revolutionary War</a>, North Carolina had around 7,800 men join the <a>Continental Army</a> under General <a>George Washington</a>; and an additional 10,000 served in local militia units under such leaders as General <a>Nathanael Greene</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> There was some military action, especially in 1780–81. Many Carolinian frontiersmen had moved west over the mountains, into the <a>Washington District</a> (later known as <a>Tennessee</a>), but in 1789, following the Revolution, the state was persuaded to relinquish its claim to the western lands. It ceded them to the national government so the <a>Northwest Territory</a> could be organized and managed nationally.

</p>
<p>
A major American victory in the war took place at <a>King's Mountain</a> along the North Carolina–South Carolina border; on October 7, 1780, a force of 1,000 mountain men from western North Carolina (including what is today the state of <a>Tennessee</a>) and <a>southwest Virginia</a> overwhelmed a force of some 1,000 British troops led by Major <a>Patrick Ferguson</a>. Most of the soldiers fighting for the British side in this battle were Carolinians who had remained loyal to the Crown (they were called "Tories" or Loyalists). The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence, and it prevented the British Army from recruiting new soldiers from the Tories.

<p>
The road to <a>Yorktown</a> and America's independence from <a>Great Britain</a> led through North Carolina. As the <a>British Army</a> moved north from victories in <a>Charleston</a> and <a>Camden, South Carolina</a>, the Southern Division of the <a>Continental Army</a> and local militia prepared to meet them. Following General <a>Daniel Morgan</a>'s victory over the British Cavalry Commander <a>Banastre Tarleton</a> at the <a>Battle of Cowpens</a> on January 17, 1781, southern commander <a>Nathanael Greene</a> led British Lord <a>Charles Cornwallis</a> across the heartland of North Carolina, and away from the latter's base of supply in Charleston, South Carolina. This campaign is known as "The Race to the Dan" or "The Race for the River".<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the <a>Battle of Cowan's Ford</a>, Cornwallis met resistance along the banks of the <a>Catawba River</a> at Cowan's Ford on February 1, 1781, in an attempt to engage General Morgan's forces during a tactical withdrawal.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> Morgan had moved to the northern part of the state to combine with General Greene's newly recruited forces. Generals Greene and Cornwallis finally met at the <a>Battle of Guilford Courthouse</a> in present-day <a>Greensboro</a> on March 15, 1781. Although the <a>British</a> troops held the field at the end of the battle, their casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Continental Army were crippling. Following this "<a>Pyrrhic victory</a>", Cornwallis chose to move to the Virginia coastline to get reinforcements, and to allow the <a>Royal Navy</a> to protect his battered army. This decision would result in Cornwallis' eventual defeat at <a>Yorktown, Virginia</a>, later in 1781. The Patriots' victory there guaranteed American independence. On November 21, 1789, North Carolina became the twelfth state to ratify the <a>U.S. constitution</a>.

After 1800, cotton and <a>tobacco</a> became important export crops. The eastern half of the state, especially the Coastal Plain region, developed a slave society based on a <a>plantation</a> system and <a>slave</a> labor. Planters owning large estates wielded significant political and socio-economic power in antebellum North Carolina. They placed their interests above those of the generally non-slave-holding "yeoman" farmers of North Carolina. While slaveholding was slightly less concentrated compared to some other Southern states, according to the 1860 census, more than 330,000 people, or 33% of the population out of 992,622 people in total, were enslaved African Americans.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> They lived and worked chiefly on plantations in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain regions of the state. In addition, 30,463 <a>free people of color</a> lived in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> They were also mainly concentrated in the eastern coastal plain, especially at port cities such as Wilmington and New Bern, where a variety of jobs were available. Most were descendants from free African Americans who had migrated along with neighbors from <a>Virginia</a> during the 18th century. The majority were the descendants of unions in the working classes between white women, indentured servants or free, and African men, indentured, slave or free.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>

<p>
After the American Revolution, <a>Quakers</a> and <a>Mennonites</a> worked to persuade slaveholders to free their slaves. Some were inspired by their efforts and the language of the Revolution to arrange for <a>manumission</a> of their slaves. The number of free people of color rose markedly in the first couple of decades after the Revolution.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> Many <a>free people of color</a> migrated to the frontier, along with their European-American neighbors, where the social system was looser. By 1810, nearly three percent of the free population consisted of free people of color, who numbered slightly more than 10,000. The western areas of North Carolina were mainly white families of <a>European</a> descent, especially <a>Scotch-Irish</a>, who operated small subsistence farms. In the early national period, the state became a center of <a>Jeffersonian</a> and <a>Jacksonian democracy</a>, with a strong <a>Whig</a> presence, especially in the western part of the state. After <a>Nat Turner</a>'s slave uprising in 1831, North Carolina and other southern states reduced the rights of free blacks. In 1835, the legislature withdrew their right to vote.

</p>
<p>
In mid-century, the state's rural and commercial areas were connected by the construction of a 129 mi (208 km) wooden plank road, known as a "farmer's railroad", from <a>Fayetteville</a> in the east to <a>Bethania</a> (northwest of <a>Winston-Salem</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> On October 25, 1836, construction began on the <a>Wilmington and Raleigh Railroad</a><sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> to connect the port city of <a>Wilmington</a> with the state capital of <a>Raleigh</a>. In 1840, the <a>state capitol</a> building in Raleigh was completed, and still stands today.

</p>
<p>
In 1849, the North Carolina Railroad was created by act of the legislature to extend that railroad west to <a>Greensboro</a>, <a>High Point</a>, and <a>Charlotte</a>. During the Civil War, the Wilmington-to-Raleigh stretch of the railroad would be vital to the Confederate war effort; supplies shipped into Wilmington would be moved by rail through Raleigh to the Confederate capital of <a>Richmond, Virginia</a>.

<p>
In 1860, North Carolina was a slave state, in which one-third of the state's total population was enslaved. The state did not vote to join the <a>Confederacy</a> until President <a>Abraham Lincoln</a> called on it to invade its sister state,<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup><a>South Carolina</a> , becoming the last or penultimate state to officially join the Confederacy. The title of "last to join the Confederacy" has been disputed; although Tennessee's informal secession on May 7, 1861, preceded North Carolina's official secession on May 20,<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> the Tennessee legislature did not formally vote to secede until June 8, 1861.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Around 125,000 troops from North Carolina served in the Confederate Army, and about 15,000 North Carolina troops (both black and white) served in <a>Union Army regiments</a>, along with many other men leaving the state to join Union regiments elsewhere.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> Over 30,000 North Carolina troops died from disease, battlefield wounds, or starvation.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Elected in 1862, Governor <a>Zebulon Baird Vance</a> tried to maintain state autonomy against Confederate President <a>Jefferson Davis</a> in <a>Richmond</a>. The state government was reluctant to support the demands of the national government in <a>Richmond</a>, and the state was the scene of only small battles. In 1865, Durham County saw the largest single surrender of Confederate soldiers when <a>Joseph E. Johnston</a> surrendered the Army of Tennessee and all remaining Confederate forces still active in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, totalling 89,270 soldiers.

<p>
After secession, some North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy. Some of the yeoman farmers chiefly in the state's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War, with others covertly supporting the <a>Union</a> cause during the conflict.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> Approximately 15,000 North Carolinians (both black and white) from across the state would enlist in the <a>Union Army</a>. Numerous slaves would also escape to Union lines, where they became essentially free.

</p>
<p>
Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in virtually all the major battles of the <a>Army of Northern Virginia</a>, the Confederacy's most famous army. The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at <a>Bentonville</a>, which was a futile attempt by Confederate General <a>Joseph Johnston</a> to slow Union General <a>William Tecumseh Sherman</a>'s advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> In April 1865, after losing the <a>Battle of Morrisville</a>, Johnston surrendered to Sherman at <a>Bennett Place</a>, in what is today <a>Durham</a>. North Carolina's port city of <a>Wilmington</a>, was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union, in February 1865, after the Union won the nearby <a>Second Battle of Fort Fisher</a>, its major defense downriver.

<p>
The first Confederate soldier to be killed in the Civil War was Private Henry Wyatt from North Carolina, in the <a>Battle of Big Bethel</a> in June 1861. At the <a>Battle of Gettysburg</a> in July 1863, the 26th North Carolina Regiment participated in <a>Pickett/Pettigrew's Charge</a> and advanced the farthest into the Northern lines of any Confederate regiment. During the <a>Battle of Chickamauga</a>, the 58th North Carolina Regiment advanced farther than any other regiment on Snodgrass Hill to push back the remaining Union forces from the battlefield. At <a>Appomattox Court House</a> in Virginia in April 1865, the 75th North Carolina Regiment, a cavalry unit, fired the last shots of the Confederate <a>Army of Northern Virginia</a> in the Civil War. For many years, some North Carolinians proudly boasted that they had been "First at Bethel, Farthest at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and Last at Appomattox".

<h3 id="Reconstruction_era%20through%20late%2019th%20century">Reconstruction era through late 19th century</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era">Reconstruction era</a></div>
<p>
Following the collapse of the Confederacy in 1865, North Carolina, along with the rest of the former Confederate States, was put under direct control by the <a>U.S. military</a> and was relieved of its <a>constitutional government</a> and representation within the <a>United States Congress</a> in what is now referred to as the <a>Reconstruction era</a>. In order to earn back its rights, the state had to make concessions to Washington, one of which was ratifying the <a>Thirteenth Amendment</a>. Congressional Republicans during Reconstruction, commonly referred to as "<a>radical Republicans</a>", constantly pushed for new constitutions for each of the Southern states that emphasized on equal rights for African-Americans. In 1868, a constitutional convention restored the state government of North Carolina. Though the <a>Fifteenth Amendment</a> was also adopted that same year, it remained <a>in most cases</a> ineffective for almost a century, not to mention paramilitary groups and their <a>lynching</a> with impunity.

</p>
<p>
The elections in April 1868 following the constitutional convention led to a narrow victory for a Republican-dominated government, with 19 African-Americans holding positions in the <a>North Carolina State Legislature</a>. In attempt to put the reforms into effect, the new Republican Governor <a>William W. Holden</a> declared martial law on any county allegedly not complying with law and order using the passage of the <a>Shoffner Act</a>.

</p>
<p>
A <a>Republican Party</a> coalition of black freedmen, northern <a>carpetbaggers</a> and local <a>scalawags</a> controlled state government for three years. The white conservative Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1870, in part by <a>Ku Klux Klan</a> violence and terrorism at the polls, to suppress black voting. Republicans were elected to the governorship until 1876, when the <a>Red Shirts</a>, a paramilitary organization that arose in 1874 and was allied with the <a>Democratic Party</a>, helped suppress black voting. More than 150 black Americans were murdered in electoral violence in 1876.

</p>
<p>
Post civil war-debt cycles pushed people to switch from subsistence agriculture to commodity agriculture. Among this time the notorious Crop-Lien system developed and was financially difficult on landless whites and blacks, due to high amounts of usury. Also due to the push for commodity agriculture, the free range was ended. Prior to this time people fenced in their crops and had their livestock feeding on the free range areas. After the ending of the free range people now fenced their animals and had their crops in the open.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Democrats were elected to the legislature and governor's office, but the <a>Populists</a> attracted voters displeased with them. In 1896 a biracial, Populist-Republican Fusionist coalition gained the governor's office and passed laws that would extend the voting franchise to blacks and poor whites. The Democrats regained control of the legislature in 1896 and passed laws to impose <a>Jim Crow</a> and <a>racial segregation</a> of public facilities. Voters of North Carolina's 2nd congressional district elected a total of four African-American <a>congressmen</a> through these years of the late 19th century.

</p>
<p>
Political tensions ran so high a small group of white Democrats in 1898 planned to take over the <a>Wilmington</a> government if their candidates were not elected. In the <a>Wilmington Insurrection of 1898</a>, more than 1,500 white men attacked the black newspaper and neighborhood, killed numerous men, and ran off the white Republican mayor and aldermen. They installed their own people and elected <a>Alfred M. Waddell</a> as mayor, in the only <a>coup d'état</a> in United States history.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1899, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with requirements for <a>poll taxes</a> and <a>literacy tests</a> for voter registration which <a>disenfranchised</a> most black Americans in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Exclusion from voting had wide effects: it meant black Americans could not serve on juries or in any local office. After a decade of <a>white supremacy</a>, many people forgot North Carolina had ever had thriving middle-class black Americans.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> Black citizens had no political voice in the state until after the federal <a>Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and <a>Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> were passed to enforce their constitutional rights. It was not until 1992 that another <a>African American</a> was elected as a U.S. Representative from North Carolina.

<p>
After the reconstruction era, North Carolina had become a one-party state, dominated by the <a>Democratic Party</a>. The state mainly continued with an economy based on <a>tobacco</a>, cotton textiles and commodity agriculture. Large towns and cities remained in few numbers. However, a major industrial base emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century, in the counties of the <a>Piedmont Triad</a>, based on cotton mills established at the <a>fall line</a>. Railroads were built to connect the new industrializing cities. The state was the site of <a>the first successful controlled, powered and sustained heavier-than-air flight</a>, by the <a>Wright brothers</a>, near <a>Kitty Hawk</a> on December 17, 1903. In the first half of the 20th century, many African Americans left the state to go North for better opportunities, in the <a>Great Migration</a>. Their departure changed the demographic characteristics of many areas.

</p>
<p>
North Carolina was hard hit by the <a>Great Depression</a>, but the <a>New Deal</a> programs of <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> for cotton and tobacco significantly helped the farmers. After <a>World War II</a>, the state's economy grew rapidly, highlighted by the growth of such cities as Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in the Piedmont region. Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill form the <a>Research Triangle</a>, a major area of universities and advanced scientific and technical research.

</p>
<p>
By the late 1960s, spurred in part by the increasingly leftward tilt of national Democrats, conservative whites began to vote for Republican national candidates and gradually for more Republicans locally. The <a>Greensboro Sit-ins</a> played a crucial role in the Civil Rights Movement to bring full equality to American blacks.

<p>
Since the 1970s, North Carolina has seen steady increases in population growth. This growth has largely occurred in metropolitan areas located within the <a>Piedmont Crescent</a>, in places such as Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, and Durham.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> The Charlotte metropolitan area has experienced large growth mainly due to its finance, banking, and tech industries.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By the 1990s, Charlotte had become a major regional and national <a>banking</a> center. Towards the Raleigh area, North Carolina State, Duke University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have helped the <a>Research Triangle</a> attract an educated workforce and develop more jobs.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Tourism has also been a boom for the North Carolina economy, as people flock to the Outer Banks and coastal beach areas, as well as the Blue Ridge Mountains anchored by <a>Asheville</a>.

<p>
North Carolina is bordered by <a>South Carolina</a> on the south, <a>Georgia</a> on the southwest, <a>Tennessee</a> on the west, <a>Virginia</a> on the north, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east. The <a>United States Census Bureau</a> places North Carolina in the <a>South Atlantic</a> division of the <a>southern</a> region.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
North Carolina consists of three main geographic regions: the <a>Atlantic coastal plain</a>, occupying the eastern portion of the state; the central <a>Piedmont</a> region, and the mountain region in the west, which is part of the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a>. The coastal plain consists of more specifically-defined areas known as the <a>Outer Banks</a>, a string of sandy, narrow <a>barrier islands</a> separated from the mainland by sounds or inlets, including <a>Albemarle Sound</a> and <a>Pamlico Sound</a>, the native home of the <a>venus flytrap</a>, and the inner coastal plain, where <a>longleaf pine</a> trees are native.

</p>
<p>
So many ships have been lost off <a>Cape Hatteras</a> that the area is known as the "<a>Graveyard of the Atlantic</a>"; more than a thousand ships have sunk in these waters since records began in 1526. The most famous of these is the <i><a>Queen Anne's Revenge</a></i> (flagship of the pirate <a>Blackbeard</a>), which went aground in Beaufort Inlet in 1718.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the <a>Atlantic Seaboard fall line</a>, the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers. The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state's most populous region, containing the six largest cities in the state by population.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> It consists of gently rolling countryside frequently broken by hills or low mountain ridges. Small, isolated, and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont, including the <a>Sauratown Mountains</a>, <a>Pilot Mountain</a>, the <a>Uwharrie Mountains</a>, <a>Crowder's Mountain</a>, <a>King's Pinnacle</a>, the <a>Brushy Mountains</a>, and the <a>South Mountains</a>. The Piedmont ranges from about 300 feet (91 m) in elevation in the east to about 1,500 feet (460 m) in the west.

</p>
<p>
The <a>western section</a> of the state is part of the <a>Blue Ridge Mountains</a> of the larger <a>Appalachian Mountain</a> range. Among the subranges of the Blue Ridge Mountains located in the state are the <a>Great Smoky Mountains</a> and the <a>Black Mountains</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> The Black Mountains are the highest in the eastern United States, and culminate in <a>Mount Mitchell</a> at 6,684 feet (2,037 m), the highest point east of the <a>Mississippi River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Cullasaja.jpg/170px-Cullasaja.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
North Carolina has 17 major river basins. The five basins west of the <a>Blue Ridge Mountains</a> flow to the <a>Gulf of Mexico</a>, while the remainder flow to the Atlantic Ocean.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> Of the 17 basins, 11 originate within the state of North Carolina, but only four are contained entirely within the state's border—the <a>Cape Fear</a>, the <a>Neuse</a>, the <a>White Oak</a>, and the <a>Tar</a>–<a>Pamlico</a> basin.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>

<p>
Elevation above sea level is most responsible for temperature change across the state, with the mountainous regions being coolest year-round. The climate is also influenced by the Atlantic Ocean and the <a>Gulf Stream</a>, especially in the coastal plain. These influences tend to cause warmer winter temperatures along the coast, where temperatures only occasionally drop below the freezing point at night. The coastal plain averages around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of snow or ice annually, and in many years, there may be no snow or ice at all.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Atlantic Ocean exerts less influence on the climate of the Piedmont region, which has hotter summers and colder winters than along the coast, though the average daily maximum is still below 90 °F (32 °C) in most locations.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
North Carolina experiences severe weather both in summer and in winter, with summer bringing threat of <a>hurricanes</a>, <a>tropical storms</a>, heavy rain, and flooding.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> Destructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include <a>Hurricane Fran</a>, <a>Hurricane Florence</a>, <a>Hurricane Floyd</a>, <a>Hurricane Hugo</a>, and <a>Hurricane Hazel</a>, the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state, as a <a>Category<span></span>4</a> in 1954. <a>Hurricane Isabel</a> ranks as the most destructive of the 21st century.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
North Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year, many of them produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain. Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state. The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east. A phenomenon known as "<a>cold-air damming</a>" often occurs in the northwestern part of the state, which can weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In April 2011, <a>the worst tornado outbreak</a> in North Carolina's history occurred. Thirty confirmed tornadoes touched down, mainly in the Eastern Piedmont and Sandhills, killing at least 24 people.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> In September 2019 <a>Hurricane Dorian</a> hit the area.

<p>
North Carolina residents since the colonial era have historically been overwhelmingly <a>Protestant</a>—first <a>Anglican</a>, then Baptist and Methodist. In 2010, the Southern Baptist Convention was the single largest Christian denomination, with 4,241 churches and 1,513,000 members. The second largest was the <a>United Methodist Church</a>, with 660,000 members and 1,923 churches. The third was the <a>Roman Catholic Church</a>, with 428,000 members in 190 <a>parishes</a>. The fourth largest was the <a>Presbyterian Church (USA)</a>, with 186,000 members and 710 congregations; this denomination was brought by Scots-Irish immigrants who settled the backcountry in the colonial era.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1845, the Baptists split into regional associations of the Northern United States and Southern U.S., over the issue of slavery. These new associations were the Northern Baptist Convention (today the <a>American Baptist Churches USA</a>) and <a>Southern Baptist Convention</a>. By the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination in North Carolina were <a>Baptists</a>. After <a>emancipation</a>, black Baptists quickly set up their own independent congregations in North Carolina and other states of the South, as they wanted to be free of white supervision.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup> Black Baptists developed their own state and national associations, such as the <a>National Baptist Convention</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> Other primarily African American Baptist conventions which grew in the state since the 20th century were the <a>Progressive National Baptist Convention</a> and <a>Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Methodists</a> (the second largest group among North Carolinian Protestants) were divided along racial lines in the <a>United Methodist Church</a> and <a>African Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. The Methodist tradition tends to be strong in the northern Piedmont, especially in populous <a>Guilford County</a>. Other prominent Protestant groups in North Carolina as of the <a>Pew Research Center</a>'s 2014 study were <a>non/interdenominational Protestants</a> and <a>Pentecostalism</a>. The <a>Assemblies of God</a> and <a>Church of God in Christ</a> are the largest Pentecostal denominations operating in the state, while notable minorities include <a>Oneness Pentecostals</a> primarily affiliated with the <a>United Pentecostal Church International</a>.

</p>
<p>
The state also has a special history with the <a>Moravian Church</a>, as settlers of this faith (largely of German origin) settled in the <a>Winston-Salem</a> area in the 18th and 19th centuries. <a>Presbyterians</a>, historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in <a>Charlotte</a> and in <a>Scotland County</a>.

</p>
<p>

A wide variety of non-Christian faiths are practiced by other residents in the state, including: <a>Judaism</a>, <a>Islam</a>, <a>Baháʼí</a>, <a>Buddhism</a>, and <a>Hinduism</a>. The rapid influx of <a>Northerners</a> and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing ethnic and religious diversity within the state. The number of Roman Catholics and <a>Jews</a> in the state has increased, along with general religious diversity as a whole. There are also a substantial number of <a>Quakers</a> in Guilford County and northeastern North Carolina. Many universities and colleges in the state have been founded on religious traditions, and some currently maintain that affiliation, including:<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup>

According to a Forbes article written in 2013, Employment in the "Old North State" has gained many different industry sectors. Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) industries in the area surrounding North Carolina's capital have grown 17.9 percent since 2001. Raleigh ranked the third best city for technology in 2020 due to the state's growing technology sector.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> In 2010, North Carolina's total gross state product was $424.9<span></span>billion,<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> while the state debt in November 2012, according to one source, totalled $2.4<span></span>billion,<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> while according to another, was in 2012 $57.8<span></span>billion.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> In 2011, the civilian labor force was at around 4.5<span></span>million with employment near 4.1<span></span>million.

North Carolina has 15 metropolitan areas,<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> and in 2010 was chosen as the third-best state for business by Forbes Magazine, and the second-best state by chief executive officer Magazine.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> Since 2000, there has been a clear division in the economic growth of North Carolina's urban and rural areas. While North Carolina's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth, low unemployment, and rising wages, many of the state's rural counties have suffered from job loss, rising levels of poverty, and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. According to one estimate, one-half of North Carolina's 100 counties have lost population since 2010, primarily due to the poor economy in many of North Carolina's rural areas. However, the population of the state's urban areas is steadily increasing.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup>

A culinary staple of North Carolina is pork <a>barbecue</a>. There are strong regional differences and rivalries over the sauces and methods used in making the barbecue. The common trend across Western North Carolina is the use of premium grade <a>Boston butt</a>. Western North Carolina pork barbecue uses a tomato-based sauce, and only the pork shoulder (dark meat) is used. Western North Carolina barbecue is commonly referred to as Lexington barbecue after the <a>Piedmont Triad</a> town of <a>Lexington</a>, home of the <a>Lexington Barbecue Festival</a>, which attracts more than 100,000 visitors each October.<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup> Eastern North Carolina pork barbecue uses a <a>vinegar</a>-and-red-pepper-based sauce and the "whole hog" is cooked, thus integrating both white and dark meat.

<p>
The government of North Carolina is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. These consist of the <a>Council of State</a> (led by the <a>Governor</a>), the <a>bicameral</a> legislature (called the <a>General Assembly</a>), and the state court system (headed by the <a>North Carolina Supreme Court</a>). The <a>state constitution</a> delineates the structure and function of the state government. North Carolina has 13 seats in the <a>U.S. House of Representatives</a> and two seats in the <a>U.S. Senate</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
North Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw <a>Tar Heel</a> voters elect a bicameral <a>Republican</a> majority legislature for the first time in more than a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern <a>swing state</a> in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat <a>Jimmy Carter</a>'s comfortable victory in the state <a>in 1976</a>, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat <a>Barack Obama</a> narrowly won the state <a>in 2008</a>. In the 1990s, Democrat <a>Bill Clinton</a> came within a point of winning the state <a>in 1992</a> and also only narrowly lost the state <a>in 1996</a>. In the early 2000s, Republican <a>George W. Bush</a> easily won the state by more than 12 points.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
By 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in densely populated areas such as the <a>Research Triangle</a>, <a>Charlotte</a>, <a>Greensboro</a>, <a>Winston-Salem</a>, <a>Fayetteville</a>, and <a>Asheville</a>, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In <a>2012</a>, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their <a>2012 Democratic National Convention</a> in Charlotte. However, Republican <a>Mitt Romney</a> ultimately eked out a two-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with <a>Indiana</a>) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012. Furthermore, Republican Donald Trump carried the state in 2016 and 2020.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2012, the state elected a Republican governor (<a>Pat McCrory</a>) and lieutenant governor (<a>Dan Forest</a>) for the first time in more than two decades, while also giving the Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the State House of Representatives and the State Senate. Several U.S. House of Representatives seats flipped control in 2012, with the Republicans holding nine seats to the Democrats' four. In the 2014 mid-term elections, Republican <a>David Rouzer</a> won the state's <a>seventh congressional district</a> seat, increasing the congressional delegation party split to 10–3 in favor of the GOP.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
North Carolina Republicans won 10 of the 13 seats in 2016, when Democrats got 47 percent of the statewide vote. In 2018 Republicans took nine, with one seat undecided, even though Democrats got 48 percent of the overall vote.

</p>
<h3 id="Gerrymandering">Gerrymandering</h3>
<p>
Because of gerrymandering in redistricting after the 2010 census, Democrats have been underrepresented in the state and Congressional delegations since 2012, although they have sometimes represented more than half the state's population.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup> The state was sued for <a>racially gerrymandering</a> the districts, which resulted in minority voting power being diluted in some areas, resulting in skewed representation. The federal court ordered redistricting in 2015.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup> Two suits challenging the state congressional district map were led by "two dozen voters, the state Democratic Party, the state chapter of the League of Women Voters, and the interest group Common Cause".<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup> They contend that the redistricting resulted in deliberate under-representation of a substantial portion of voters. This case reached the United States Supreme Court in March 2019, which also heard a related partisan gerrymandering case from Maryland.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup>

<p>
North Carolina is home to four <a>major league</a> sports franchises: the <a>Carolina Panthers</a> of the <a>National Football League</a>, the <a>Charlotte Hornets</a> of the <a>National Basketball Association</a>, and <a>Charlotte FC</a> of <a>Major League Soccer</a> are based in Charlotte, while the Raleigh-based <a>Carolina Hurricanes</a> play in the <a>National Hockey League</a>. The Panthers and Hurricanes are the only two major professional sports teams that have the same geographical designation while playing in different metropolitan areas. The Hurricanes are the only major professional team from North Carolina to have won a league championship, <a>having captured the Stanley Cup in 2006.</a> North Carolina is also home to two other top-level professional teams in less prominent sports—the Charlotte Hounds of <a>Major League Lacrosse</a> and the <a>North Carolina Courage</a> of the <a>National Women's Soccer League</a>.

</p>
<p>
While North Carolina has no <a>Major League Baseball</a> team, it does have numerous <a>Minor League Baseball</a> teams, with the highest level of play coming from the <a>Triple-A</a><a>Charlotte Knights</a>  and <a>Durham Bulls</a>. Additionally, North Carolina has minor league teams in other team sports including <a>soccer</a> and <a>ice hockey</a>, most notably <a>North Carolina FC</a> and the <a>Charlotte Checkers</a>, both of which play in the second tier of their respective sports.

</p>
<p>
In addition to professional team sports, North Carolina has a strong affiliation with <a>NASCAR</a> and stock-car racing, with <a>Charlotte Motor Speedway</a> in <a>Concord</a> hosting two <a>Cup Series</a> races every year. Charlotte also hosts the <a>NASCAR Hall of Fame</a>, while Concord is the home of several top-flight racing teams, including <a>Hendrick Motorsports</a>, <a>Roush Fenway Racing</a>, <a>Petty GMS Motorsports</a>, <a>Stewart-Haas Racing</a>, and <a>Chip Ganassi Racing</a>. Numerous other tracks around North Carolina host races from low-tier NASCAR circuits as well.

</p>
<p>
Golf is a popular summertime leisure activity, and North Carolina has hosted several important professional golf tournaments. <a>Pinehurst Resort</a> in <a>Pinehurst</a> has hosted a <a>PGA Championship</a>, <a>Ryder Cup</a>, two <a>U.S. Opens</a>, and one <a>U.S. Women's Open</a>. The <a>Wells Fargo Championship</a> is a regular stop on the <a>PGA Tour</a> and is held at <a>Quail Hollow Club</a> in Charlotte, and Quail Hollow has also played host to the PGA Championship. The <a>Wyndham Championship</a> is played annually in Greensboro at <a>Sedgefield Country Club</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>College sports</a> are also popular in North Carolina, with 18 schools competing at the <a>Division I</a> level. The <a>Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) is headquartered in <a>Greensboro</a>, and both the <a>ACC Football Championship Game</a> (Charlotte) and the <a>ACC Men's Basketball Tournament</a> (Greensboro) were most recently held in North Carolina. Additionally, the city of <a>Charlotte</a> is home to the <a>National Junior College Athletics Association</a>'s (NJCAA) headquarters.<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup><a>College basketball</a>  is very popular in North Carolina, buoyed by the <a>Tobacco Road</a> rivalries between ACC members <a>North Carolina</a>, <a>Duke</a>, <a>North Carolina State</a>, and <a>Wake Forest</a>. The <a>ACC Championship Game</a> and the <a>Duke's Mayo Bowl</a> are held annually in Charlotte's <a>Bank of America Stadium</a>, featuring teams from the ACC and the <a>Southeastern Conference</a>. Additionally, the state has hosted the NCAA Men's Basketball <a>Final Four</a> on two occasions, in Greensboro in 1974 and in Charlotte in 1994.
