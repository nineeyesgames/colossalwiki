<b>New Mexico</b> (<a>Spanish</a>: <i>Nuevo México</i>, <i>Nuevo Méjico</i>,<sup><a href="#ref_Note 1">[Note 1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup><small></small><span><a>[ˈnweβo ˈmexiko]</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span>  ; <a>Navajo</a>: <i>Yootó Hahoodzo</i><small></small><span><a>[joː˩tʰo˥ ha˩hoː˩tso˩]</a></span> ) is a <a>state</a> in the <a>Southwestern United States</a>. It is one of the <a>Mountain States</a> of the southern <a>Rocky Mountains</a>, sharing the <a>Four Corners</a> region of the <a>western U.S.</a> with <a>Utah</a>, <a>Colorado</a>, and <a>Arizona</a>, and bordering <a>Texas</a> to the east and southeast, <a>Oklahoma</a> to the northeast, and the <a>Mexican states</a> of <a>Chihuahua</a> and <a>Sonora</a> to the south. The <a>state capital</a> is <a>Santa Fe</a>, which is the oldest capital in the U.S., founded in 1610 as the government seat of <a>Nuevo México</a> in <a>New Spain</a>; the largest city is <a>Albuquerque</a>.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico is the <a>fifth-largest</a> of the <a>fifty states</a>, but with just over 2.1 million residents, ranks <a>36th in population</a> and <a>46th in population density</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_Note 2">[Note 2]</a></sup> Its climate and geography are highly varied, ranging from forested mountains to sparse deserts; the <a>northern</a> and <a>eastern regions</a> exhibit a colder <a>alpine climate</a>, while the west and south are warmer and <a>more arid</a>; the <a>Rio Grande</a> and <a>its fertile valley</a> runs from north-to-south, creating a <a>riparian</a> climate through the <a>center of the state</a> that supports a <a>bosque</a> habitat and distinct <a>Albuquerque Basin</a> climate. One–third of New Mexico's land is federally owned, and the state hosts many protected wilderness areas and national monuments, including <a>three UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>New Mexico's economy</a> is highly diversified, with major sectors including <a>oil</a> and <a>mineral extraction</a>, <a>cattle ranching</a>, <a>agriculture</a>, <a>lumber</a>, <a>scientific</a> and <a>technological</a> research, tourism, and <a>the arts</a>, especially <a>textiles</a> and <a>visual arts</a>. Its total <a>gross domestic product</a> (GDP) in 2020 was $95.73 billion, with a GDP per capita of roughly $46,300.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><a>State tax policy</a>  is characterized by low to moderate taxation of resident personal income by national standards, with tax credits, exemptions, and special considerations for military personnel and favorable industries; subsequently, <a>its film industry</a> is one of the largest and fastest growing in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Due to its large area and economic climate<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, New Mexico has a significant <a>U.S. military</a> presence, including <a>White Sands Missile Range</a>, and strategically valuable federal research centers, such as <a>Sandia</a> and <a>Los Alamos National Laboratories</a>. The state hosted several <a>key facilities</a> of the <a>Manhattan Project</a>, which developed the world's first <a>atomic bomb</a>, and was the site of the first nuclear test, <a>Trinity</a>.

</p>
<p>
In prehistoric times, New Mexico was home to <a>Ancestral Puebloans</a>, <a>Mogollon</a>, and the modern <a>Comanche</a> and <a>Utes.</a><sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><a>Spanish explorers and settlers</a>  arrived in the 16th century, naming the territory <a><i>Nuevo México</i></a> after the Aztec <a>Valley of Mexico</a>, more than 250 years before the establishment and naming of the present-day country of <a>Mexico</a>; thus, the state did  <i>not</i> derive its name from Mexico.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> Isolated by its rugged terrain and the <a>relative dominance</a> of its indigenous people, New Mexico was a <a>peripheral</a> part of the <a>viceroyalty</a> of <a>New Spain</a>. Following <a>Mexican independence</a> in 1821, it became an <a>autonomous region</a> of Mexico, though this autonomy was increasingly threatened by the centralizing policies of the Mexican government, culminating in the <a>Revolt of 1837</a>; at the same time, the region became more economically dependent on the United States. At the conclusion of the <a>Mexican–American War</a> in 1848, the U.S. <a>annexed New Mexico</a> as part of the larger <a>New Mexico Territory</a>. It played a central role in <a>American westward expansion</a>, and was <a>admitted to the Union</a> in 1912.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico's history has contributed to its unique demographic and cultural character. One of only six <a>majority-minority states</a>, it has the nation's highest percentage of <a>Hispanic and Latino Americans</a> and the second-highest percentage of <a>Native Americans</a> after <a>Alaska</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> New Mexico is home to part of the <a>Navajo Nation</a>, 19 <a>federally recognized</a><a>Pueblo communities</a> , and three different federally recognized <a>Apache</a> tribes. Its large Hispanic population includes <a>Hispanos</a>, who descend from early Spanish settlers, as well as <a>Chicanos</a> and <a>Mexicans</a>. The <a>New Mexican flag</a>, which is among the most recognizable in the U.S.,<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> reflects the state's eclectic origins, bearing the scarlet and gold coloration of the <a>Spanish flag</a> along with the ancient sun symbol of the <a>Zia</a>, a Puebloan tribe.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> The confluence of indigenous, Spanish, Mexican, Hispanic, and <a>American</a> influences is also evident in New Mexico's <a>unique cuisine</a>, <a>music genre</a>, and <a>architecture</a>.

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
New Mexico received its name long before the present-day nation of <a>Mexico</a> won independence from Spain and adopted that name in 1821. The name "Mexico" derives from <a>Nahuatl</a> and originally referred to the heartland of the <a>Mexica</a> (<a>Aztec) Empire</a> in the <a>Valley of Mexico</a>, far from the area of New Mexico.

</p>
<p>
Following their <a>conquest of the Aztecs</a> in the early 16th century, the Spanish began exploring what is now the western United States, using "Mexico" in 1563 to name the region of New Mexico (Spanish: <i><i>Nuevo México</i></i>). In 1581, the <a>Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition</a> named the region north of the Rio Grande <i>San Felipe del Nuevo México</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> The Spaniards had hoped to find wealthy indigenous cultures similar to those of the <a>Mexica's</a> in central Mexico. The indigenous cultures of New Mexico, however, proved to be unrelated to the <a>Mexicas</a> and lacking in riches, but the name persisted.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Before statehood in 1912, the name "New Mexico" loosely applied to various configurations of territories in the same general area, which <a>evolved throughout the Spanish, Mexican, and American periods</a>, but typically encompassed most of present-day New Mexico along with sections of neighboring states.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>

<p>
With a total area of 121,590 square miles (314,900 km<sup>2</sup>),<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> New Mexico is the <a>fifth-largest state</a>, after Alaska, Texas, California, and Montana. Its eastern border lies along 103°W <a>longitude</a> with the state of <a>Oklahoma</a>, and 2.2 miles (3.5 kilometres) west of 103°W longitude with <a>Texas</a> (due to a 19th-century surveying error).<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> On the southern border, Texas makes up the eastern two-thirds, while the <a>Mexican</a> states of <a>Chihuahua</a> and <a>Sonora</a> make up the western third, with Chihuahua making up about 90% of that. The western border with <a>Arizona</a> runs along the <a>109° 03'W</a> longitude.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> The southwestern corner of the state is known as the <a>Bootheel</a>. The <a>37°N</a> parallel forms the northern boundary with Colorado. The states of New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Utah come together at the Four Corners in New Mexico's northwestern corner. Its surface water area is about 292 square miles (760 km<sup>2</sup>).<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Despite its popular depiction as mostly arid desert, New Mexico has one of the most diverse <a>landscapes</a> of any U.S. state, ranging from wide, auburn-colored deserts and <a>verdant grasslands</a>, to broken <a>mesas</a> and high, snow-capped peaks.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Close to a <a>third of the state is covered in timberland</a>, with heavily forested mountain wildernesses dominating the north. The <a>Sangre de Cristo Mountains</a>, the southernmost part of the <a>Rocky Mountains</a>, run roughly north–south along the east side of the <a>Rio Grande</a>, in the rugged, pastoral north. The <a>Great Plains</a> extend into the eastern third of the state, most notably the <a>Llano Estacado</a> ("Staked Plain"), whose westernmost boundary is marked by the <a>Mescalero Ridge</a><a>escarpment</a> . The northwestern quadrant of New Mexico is dominated by the <a>Colorado Plateau</a>, characterized by unique volcanic formations, dry grasslands and shrublands, open <a>pinyon-juniper woodland</a>, and mountain forests.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> The <a>Chihuahuan Desert</a>, which is the largest in North America, extends through the south.

</p>
<p>
Over four–fifths of New Mexico is higher than 4,000 feet (1,250 meters) above sea level. The average elevation ranges from up to 8,000 feet (2,500 metes) above sea level in the northwest, to less than 4,000 feet in the southeast.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> The highest point is <a>Wheeler Peak</a> at over 13,160 feet (4,011 meters) in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, while the lowest is the <a>Red Bluff Reservoir</a> at around 2,840 feet (866 meters), in the southeastern corner of the state.

</p>
<p>
In addition to the Rio Grande, which is tied for the <a>fourth-longest river in the U.S.</a>, New Mexico has four other major river systems: the <a>Pecos</a>, <a>Canadian</a>, <a>San Juan</a>, and <a>Gila</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> Nearly bisecting New Mexico from north to south, the Rio Grande has played an influential role in the region's history; its fertile floodplain has supported human habitation since prehistoric times, and European settlers initially lived exclusively in its valleys and along its tributaries.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> The Pecos, which flows roughly parallel to the Rio Grande at its east, was a popular route for explorers, as was the Canadian River, which rises in the mountainous north and flows east across the arid plains. The San Juan and Gila lie west of the <a>Continental Divide</a>, in the northwest and southwest, respectively. With the exception of the Gila, all major rivers are dammed in New Mexico and provide a major water source for <a>irrigation</a> and flood control.

</p>
<p>
Aside from its rivers, New Mexico has few sizeable natural bodies of water; there are several artificial lakes and reservoirs, the largest being <a>Elephant Butte Reservoir</a>, which was created by the damming of the Rio Grande. At its height in the early 20th century, the reservoir was the largest man-made lake in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/New_Mexico_K%C3%B6ppen.svg/250px-New_Mexico_K%C3%B6ppen.svg.png" alt="null"></div>
<p>
New Mexico has long been reputable for its pleasant, temperate climate.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Overall the state is semiarid to arid, with areas of continental and alpine climates at higher elevations. New Mexico's statewide average precipitation is 12.9 inches (330 mm) a year, with average monthly amounts peaking in the summer, particularly in the more rugged north-central area around Albuquerque and in the south. Generally, the eastern third of the state receives the most rainfall, while the western third receives the least. Higher altitudes receive around 40 inches (1,000 mm), while the lowest elevations see as little as 8 to 10 inches (200–250 mm).<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Annual temperatures can range from 65 °F (18 °C) in the southeast to below 40 °F (4 °C) in the northern mountains,<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> with the average being the mid-50s °F (12 °C). During the summer, daytime temperatures can often exceed 100 °F (38 °C) at elevations below 5,000 feet (1,500 m); the average high temperature in July ranges from 99 °F (37 °C) at the lower elevations down to 78<span></span>°F (26<span></span>°C) at the higher elevations. In the colder months of November to March, many cities in New Mexico can have nighttime temperature lows in the teens above zero, or lower. The highest temperature recorded in New Mexico was 122 °F (50 °C) at the <a>Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)</a> near <a>Loving</a> on June 27, 1994; the lowest recorded temperature is −50 °F (−46 °C) at <a>Gavilan</a> (near <a>Lindrith</a>) on February 1, 1951.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Due to the state's stable climate, which provides for clearer skies, and relative isolation, which mitigates light pollution, there are several major <a>astronomical observatories in New Mexico</a>, including the <a>Apache Point Observatory</a>, the <a>Very Large Array</a>, the <a>Magdalena Ridge Observatory</a>, and others.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>

<p>
Owing to its varied <a>topography</a>, New Mexico has six distinct <a>vegetation zones</a> that provide diverse sets of habitats for many plants and animals.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> The Upper Sonoran Zone is by far the most prominent, constituting about three-fourths of the state; it includes most of the plains, foothills, and valleys above 4,500 feet, and is defined by prairie grasses, low piñon pines, and juniper shrubs. The <a>Llano Estacado</a> in the east features <a>shortgrass prairie</a> with <a>blue grama</a>, which sustain <a>bison</a>. The <a>Chihuahuan Desert</a> in the south is characterized by shrubby <a>creosote</a>. The <a>Colorado Plateau</a> in the northwest corner of New Mexico is high desert with cold winters, featuring <a>sagebrush</a>, <a>shadescale</a>, <a>greasewood</a>, and other plants adapted to the <a>saline</a> and <a>seleniferous</a> soil.

</p>
<p>
The mountainous north hosts a wide array of vegetation types corresponding to elevation gradients, such as <a>piñon-juniper woodlands</a> near the base, through <a>evergreen</a><a>conifers</a> , <a>spruce</a>-<a>fir</a> and <a>aspen</a> forests in the transitionary zone, and <a>Krummholz</a>, and <a>alpine tundra</a> at the very top.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> The <a>Apachian zone</a> tucked into the southwestern bootheel of the state has high-calcium soil, <a>oak woodlands</a>, <a>Arizona cypress</a>, and other plants that are not found in other parts of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> The southern sections of the Rio Grande and Pecos valleys have 20,000 square miles (52,000 square km) of New Mexico's best grazing land and irrigated farmland.

</p>

New Mexico and 12 other western states account for 93% of all federally owned land in the U.S. Roughly one–third of the state, or 24.7 million of 77.8 million acres, is held by the U.S. government, the tenth-highest percentage in the country. More than half this land is under the <a>Bureau of Land Management</a>, while another third managed by the <a>U.S. Forest Service</a>.

<a>Francisco Vásquez de Coronado</a> assembled an enormous expedition at <a>Compostela</a> in 1540–1542 to explore and find the mythical <a>Seven Golden Cities of Cibola</a> as described by Fray <a>Marcos de Niza</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 19–24 </span></sup> The name <i>New Mexico</i> was first used by a seeker of gold mines named <a>Francisco de Ibarra</a>, who explored far to the north of New Spain in 1563 and reported his findings as being in "a New Mexico".<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><a>Juan de Oñate</a>  officially established the name when he was appointed the first governor of the new <a>Province of New Mexico</a> in 1598.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 36–37 </span></sup> The same year, he founded the <i><a>San Juan de los Caballeros</a></i> capital at <i><a>San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge</a></i>, the first permanent European settlement in New Mexico,<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> on the Rio Grande near <a>Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 37 </span></sup> Oñate extended <i><a>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</a></i>, Royal Road of the Interior, by 700 miles (1,100 km) from <a>Santa Bárbara, Chihuahua</a>, to his remote colony.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup><sup><span>: 49 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
The settlement of <i><a>La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís</a></i> was established as a more permanent capital at the foot of the <a>Sangre de Cristo Mountains</a> in 1610.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup><sup><span>: 182 </span></sup> As a result of the <a>Pueblo Revolt</a>, these early cities were occupied by the <a>Puebloan</a> peoples until the Spanish returned with an offer of better cultural and religious liberties for the Pueblos.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup><sup><span>: 6, 48 </span></sup> After the death of the Pueblo leader <a>Popé</a>, <a>Diego de Vargas</a> restored the area to Spanish rule.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 68–75 </span></sup> The returning settlers founded <i><a>La Villa de Alburquerque</a></i> in 1706 at <a>Old Town Albuquerque</a> as a trading center for existing surrounding communities such as <a>Barelas</a>, <a>Isleta</a>, <a>Los Ranchos</a>, and <a>Sandia</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 84 </span></sup> naming it for the viceroy of New Spain, <a>Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 10th Duke of Alburquerque</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>

<p>
As a part of New Spain, the claims for the province of New Mexico passed to independent Mexico in 1821 following the <a>Mexican War of Independence</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 109 </span></sup> The <a>Republic of Texas</a> claimed the portion east of the <a>Rio Grande</a> when it seceded from Mexico in 1836 when it incorrectly assumed the older Hispanic settlements of the upper Rio Grande were the same as the newly established Mexican settlements of Texas. Texas's only attempt to establish a presence or control in the claimed territory was the failed <a>Texan Santa Fe Expedition</a>. Their entire army was captured and jailed by the Hispanic New Mexico militia.

</p>
<p>
At the turn of the 19th century, the extreme northeastern part of New Mexico, north of the Canadian River and east of the spine of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains was still claimed by <a>France</a>, which sold it in 1803 as part of the <a>Louisiana Purchase</a>. When the <a>Louisiana Territory</a> was admitted as a state in 1812, the U.S. reclassified it as part of the <a>Missouri Territory</a>. The region (along with territory that makes up present-day southeastern Colorado, the <a>Texas</a> and <a>Oklahoma Panhandles</a>, and southwestern <a>Kansas</a>) was ceded to Spain under the <a>Adams-Onis Treaty</a> in 1819.

<p>
By 1800, the population of New Mexico had reached 25,000.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>

<p>
Following the victory of the United States in the Mexican–American War (1846–48), the <a>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a> resulted in Mexico ceding its northern holdings to the U.S., including the territories of California, Texas, and New Mexico.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 132 </span></sup> The American government vowed to accept the residents' claims to their lands and to accept them as full citizens with rights of suffrage.

</p>
<p>
After Texas was admitted as a state in 1845, it continued to claim a northeastern portion of New Mexico east of the Rio Grande. Under the <a>Compromise of 1850</a>, it was forced by the U.S. government to drop these claims in exchange for $10<span></span>million in federal funds.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 135 </span></sup> Pursuant to the compromise, Congress established the separate <a>New Mexico Territory</a> in September of that year;<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> it included most of present-day Arizona and New Mexico, along with the <a>Las Vegas</a><a>Valley</a>  and what would later become <a>Clark County</a> in <a>Nevada</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1853, the U.S. acquired the mostly desert southwestern bootheel of the state, along with Arizona land south of the Gila River, in the <a>Gadsden Purchase</a>, which was needed for the right-of-way to encourage construction of a <a>transcontinental railroad</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 136 </span></sup>

When the U.S. Civil War broke out in 1861, both <a>Confederate</a> and <a>Union</a> governments claimed ownership and territorial rights over New Mexico Territory. The Confederacy claimed the southern tract as its own <a>Arizona Territory</a>, and as part of the <a>Trans-Mississippi Theater</a> of the war, waged the ambitious <a>New Mexico Campaign</a> to control the <a>American Southwest</a> and open up access to Union California. Confederate power in the New Mexico Territory was effectively broken after the <a>Battle of Glorieta Pass</a> in 1862. However, the Confederate territorial government continued to operate out of Texas, and Confederate troops marched under the Arizona flag until the end of the war. More than 8,000 men from New Mexico Territory served in the Union Army.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the <a>American frontier</a>, many of the <a>folklore</a> characters of the <a>Western genre</a> had their origins in New Mexico, most notably businesswoman <a>Maria Gertrudis Barceló</a>, outlaw <a>Billy the Kid</a>, as well as lawmen <a>Pat Garrett</a> and <a>Elfego Baca</a>.

</p>
<p>
In the late 19th century, the majority of officially European-descended residents in New Mexico were ethnic mestizos of Native Mexican and Native American (Pueblo, Navajo, Apache, Genízaro, and Comanche) ancestry, many of whom had deep roots in the area from early Spanish colonial times, this distinctly New Mexican ethnic group became referred to as the <a>Hispanos of New Mexico</a>. Politically, they still controlled most of the town and county offices through area elections, and wealthy sheepherder families commanded considerable influence, preferring <a>business</a>, <a>legislative</a>, and <a>judicial</a> relations with fellow indigenous New Mexican groups. The Anglo Americans (which included recent African American arrivals) tended to have more ties to the territorial governor and judges, who were appointed by officials outside of the region. The Anglo minority was "outnumbered, but well-organized and growing".<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> These newly arrived settlers often tried to maintain New Mexico as a territory, since the governor was being assigned by the President of the United States, and they were worried about Native and Hispano communities being in positions of power. This mob mentality would sometimes culminate in the lynching of the Native, Hispanic, and Mexican peoples, as was attempted at the <a>Frisco shootout</a>. Prominent people attempted to fight this prejudice, including <a>Vigil</a>, <a>Garrett</a>, <a>Otero</a>, <a>Curry</a>, <a>Larrazolo</a>, <a>Baca</a>, <a>Hagerman</a>, and major constituents from both major political parties, the <a>Democratic Party of New Mexico</a> and the <a>Republican Party of New Mexico</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>

The <a>United States Congress</a> admitted New Mexico as the <a>47th state</a> on January 6, 1912.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 166 </span></sup> It had been eligible for statehood 60 years earlier but was delayed due to its majority of the population being "alien" (i.e. Mexican-American).<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
European-American settlers in the state had an uneasy relationship with the large Native American tribes, most of whose members lived on <a>reservations</a> at the beginning of the 20th century. Although Congress passed a law in 1924 that granted all Native Americans U.S. citizenship, as well as the right to vote in federal and state elections, New Mexico was among several states with <a>Jim Crow laws</a>, e.g. those who do not pay taxes cannot vote.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>

<p>
A major oil discovery in 1928 brought wealth to the state, especially <a>Lea County</a> and the town of <a>Hobbs</a>. The town was named after James Hobbs, a homesteader there in 1907.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> The Midwest State No.<span></span>1 well, begun in late 1927 with a standard cable-tool drilling rig, revealed the first signs of oil from the Hobbs field on June 13, 1928. Drilled to 4,330 feet and completed a few months later, the well-produced 700 barrels of oil per day on state land. The Midwest Refining Company's Hobbs well-produced oil until 2002. The New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources called it "the most important single discovery of oil in New Mexico's history".<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>

During <a>World War II</a>, the first <a>atomic bombs</a> were designed and manufactured at <a>Los Alamos</a>, a site developed by the federal government specifically to support a high-intensity scientific effort to rapidly complete research and testing of this weapon. The first bomb was tested at <a>Trinity site</a> in the desert between <a>Socorro</a> and <a>Alamogordo</a> on what is now <a>White Sands Missile Range</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><span>: 179–180 </span></sup>

Native Americans from New Mexico fought for the United States in both the <a>First</a> and Second World Wars. Veterans were disappointed to return and find their civil rights limited by state discrimination. In Arizona and New Mexico, veterans challenged state laws or practices prohibiting them from voting. In 1948, after veteran Miguel Trujillo, Sr. of <a>Isleta Pueblo</a> was told by the county registrar that he could not register to vote, he filed suit against the county in federal district court. A three-judge panel overturned as unconstitutional New Mexico's provisions that Indians who did not pay taxes (and could not document if they had paid taxes) could not vote.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> Judge Phillips wrote:

New Mexico has received large amounts of federal government spending on major military and research institutions in the state. It is home to three Air Force bases, the <a>White Sands Missile Range</a>, and the federal research laboratories <a>Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> and <a>Sandia National Laboratories</a>. The state's population grew rapidly after World War II, nearly doubling between 1940 and 1960;<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> by 2000, residents numbered over 1.8 million from roughly 532,000 in 1940.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> While the high military presence brought considerable investment, it has also been the center of controversy; on May 22, 1957, a B-36 <a>accidentally dropped</a> a nuclear bomb 4.5 miles from the control tower while landing at <a>Kirtland Air Force Base</a> in Albuquerque; only its conventional "trigger" detonated.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In addition to federal personnel and agencies, many residents and businesses moved to the state, particularly from the northeast, often drawn by its warm climate and low taxes<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. The pattern continues into the 21st century, with New Mexico adding over 400,000 residents between 2000 and 2020.

In the late 20th century, Native Americans were authorized by federal law to establish gaming casinos on their reservations under certain conditions, in states which had authorized such gaming. Such facilities have helped tribes close to population centers generate revenues for reinvestment in the economic development and welfare of their peoples.

The <a>2020 Census</a> recorded a population of 2,117,522, an increase of 2.8% from 2,059,179 in the <a>2010 census</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> This was the lowest rate of growth in the western U.S. after Wyoming, and among the slowest nationwide.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> By comparison, between <a>2000</a> and 2010, New Mexico's population increased by 11.7% from 1,819,046—among the fastest growth rates in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> A report commissioned by the New Mexico Legislature attributed the slow growth to a <a>negative net migration rate</a>, particularly among those 18 or younger, and to a 19% decline in the birth rate.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> However, growth among the Hispanic and Native American communities remained healthy.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
More than half of New Mexicans (51.4%) were born in the state; 37.9% were born in another state; 1.1% were born in either Puerto Rico, an <a>island territory</a>, or abroad to at least one American parent; and 9.4% were foreign born (compared to a national average of roughly 12%).<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Almost a quarter of the population (22.7%) was under the age of 18, and the state's median age of 38.4 is <a>slightly above the national average</a> of 38.2. New Mexico's somewhat older population is partly reflective of its popularity among retirees: It ranked as the most popular retirement destination in 2018,<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> with an estimated 42% of new residents being retired.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Hispanics and Latinos constitute nearly half of all residents (49.3%), giving New Mexico the highest proportion of Hispanic ancestry among the fifty states. This broad classification includes <a>descendants</a> of Spanish <a>colonists</a> who settled between the 16th and 18th centuries as well as recent immigrants from Latin America (particularly Mexico and Central America).

From 2000 to 2010, the number of persons in poverty increased to 400,779, or approximately one-fifth of the population.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> The latest 2020 census recorded a slightly reduced poverty rate of 18.2%, albeit the <a>third-highest</a> among the U.S. states, compared to a national average of 10.5%. Poverty disproportionately affects minorities, with about one-third of African-Americans and Native Americans living in poverty, compared with less than a fifth of whites and roughly a tenth of Asians; likewise, New Mexico ranks 49th among states for education equality by race and 32nd for its racial gap in income.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Mexico's population is among the most difficult to count, according to the Center for Urban Research at the <a>City University of New York</a>. Challenges include the state's size, sparse population, and numerous isolated communities.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> Likewise, the Census Bureau estimated that roughly 43% of the state's population (about 900,000 people) live in such "hard-to-count" areas.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> In response, the New Mexico government invested heavily in public outreach to increase census participation, resulting in a final tally that exceeded earlier estimates and outperformed several neighboring states.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup>

With just 17 people per square mile (6/km<sup>2</sup>), New Mexico is one of the <a>least densely populated states</a>, ranking 45th out of 50. By contrast, the overall population density of the U.S. is 90/mi<sup>2</sup> (35.5/km<sup>2</sup> ). The state is divided into 33 counties and 106 municipalities, which include cities, towns, villages, and a <a>consolidated city-county</a>, <a>Los Alamos</a>. Only two cities have at least 100,000 residents: Albuquerque and Las Cruces, whose respective metropolitan areas together account for the majority of New Mexico's population.

</p>
<p>
Residents are concentrated in the north-central region of New Mexico, anchored by the state's largest city, Albuquerque. Centered in <a>Bernalillo County</a>, the <a>Albuquerque metropolitan area</a> includes New Mexico's third-largest city, <a>Rio Rancho</a>, and has a population of over 918,000, accounting for one-third of all New Mexicans. It is adjacent to <a>Santa Fe</a>, the capital and fourth-largest city. Altogether, the <a>Albuquerque–Santa Fe–Las Vegas combined statistical area</a> includes more than 1.17 million people, or nearly 60% of the state population.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico's other major center of population is in south-central area around <a>Las Cruces</a>, its second-largest city and the largest city in both Doña Ana County and the southern region of the state. Its metropolitan area includes roughly 214,000 residents, but with neighboring <a>El Paso, Texas</a> forms a <a>combined statistical area</a> numbering over 1 million.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state hosts 23 federally recognized tribal reservations, of which 11 hold <a>off-reservation trust lands</a>. The vast majority are concentrated in the northwest, followed by the north-central region.

</p>
<p>
Like several other southwestern states, New Mexico hosts numerous <a><i>colonias</i></a> along the <a>Mexico-U.S. border</a>, a type of <a>unincorporated</a>, low-income, <a>slum</a>. These areas are characterized by abject poverty, the absence of basic services such as water and sewage, and scarce housing and infrastructure.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> The University of New Mexico estimates there are 118 colonias in the state, though the <a>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> identifies roughly 150.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>

New Mexico is one of six <a>"majority-minority"</a> states where <a>non-Hispanic whites</a> constitute less than half the population.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> As early as 1940, roughly half the population was estimated to be nonwhite.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the 2020 <a>census</a>, the majority of Hispanics in New Mexico claim descendance from Spanish colonists who settled between the 16th and 18th centuries, when the state was part of New Spain. Most remaining Hispanics are first and second generation immigrants from Mexico and Central America

</p>
<p>
New Mexico has the fourth largest Native American community in the U.S., at over 200,000. Comprising roughly one-tenth of all residents, this is the second largest population by percentage after Alaska.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> New Mexico is also the only state besides Alaska where indigenous people have maintained a stable proportion of the population for over a century: In 1890, Native Americans made up 9.4% of New Mexico's population, roughly the same percentage as in 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> By contrast, during that same period, neighboring Arizona went from one-third indigenous to less than 5%.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the <a>2000 United States Census</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup><sup><span>: 6 </span></sup>
the most commonly claimed ancestry groups in New Mexico were:

<p>
New Mexico ranks third after California and Texas in the number of multilingual residents.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup> According to the <a>2010 U.S. Census</a>, 28.45% of the population age<span></span>5 and older speak Spanish at home, while 3.50% speak <a>Navajo</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> Some speakers of <a>New Mexican Spanish</a> are descendants of pre-18th century Spanish <a>settlers</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> Contrary to popular belief, New Mexican Spanish is not an archaic form of 17th-century <a>Castilian Spanish</a>; though some archaic elements exists, linguistic research has determined that the dialect "is neither more Iberian nor more archaic" than other varieties spoken in the Americas.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> Nevertheless, centuries of isolation during the colonial period insulated the New Mexican dialect from "standard" Spanish, leading to the preservation of older vocabulary as well as its own innovations.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Besides Navajo, which is also spoken in Arizona, several other <a>Native American languages</a> are spoken by smaller groups in New Mexico, most of which are endemic to the state. Native New Mexican languages include <a>Mescalero Apache</a>, <a>Jicarilla Apache</a>, <a>Tewa</a>, <a>Southern Tiwa</a>, <a>Northern Tiwa</a>, <a>Towa</a>, <a>Keres</a> (Eastern and Western), and <a>Zuni</a>. Mescalero and Jicarilla Apache are closely related <a>Southern Athabaskan languages</a>, and both are also related to Navajo. Tewa, the Tiwa languages, and Towa belong to the <a>Kiowa-Tanoan</a> language family, and thus all descend from a <a>common ancestor</a>. Keres and Zuni are <a>language isolates</a> with no relatives outside of New Mexico.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico's original state constitution of 1911 required all laws be published in both English and Spanish for twenty years after ratification;<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup> this requirement was renewed in 1931 and 1943,<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> with some sources stating the state was officially bilingual until 1953.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> Nonetheless, the constitution does not declare any language "official".<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> While Spanish was permitted in the legislature until 1935, all state officials are required to have a good knowledge of English; consequently, some analysts argue that New Mexico cannot be considered a bilingual state, since not all laws are published in both languages.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, the state legislature remains constitutionally empowered to publish laws in English and Spanish, and to appropriate funds for translation. Amendments to the New Mexico constitution must be approved by <a>referendum</a> printed on the ballot in both English and Spanish.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> Certain legal notices must be published in English and Spanish, and the state maintains a list of newspapers for Spanish publication.<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
With regard to the judiciary, witnesses and defendants have the right to testify in either of the two languages, and monolingual speakers of Spanish have the same right to be considered for jury duty as do speakers of English.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup> In public education, the state has the constitutional obligation to provide bilingual education and Spanish-speaking instructors in school districts where the majority of students are <a>Hispanophone</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> The constitution also provides that all state citizens who speak neither English nor Spanish have a right to vote, hold public office office, and serve on juries.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1989, New Mexico became the first of only four states to officially adopt the <a>English Plus</a> resolution, which supports acceptance of non-English languages.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> In 1995, the state adopted an official bilingual song, "<a>New Mexico – Mi Lindo Nuevo México</a>".<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup><sup><span>: 75, 81 </span></sup> In 2008, New Mexico was the first to officially adopt a <a>Navajo</a> textbook for use in public schools.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup>

Like most U.S. states, New Mexico is predominantly Christian, with Roman Catholicism and Protestantism each constituting roughly a third of the population. According to <a>Association of Religion Data Archives</a> (ARDA), the largest denominations in 2010 were the <a>Catholic Church</a> (684,941 members); the <a>Southern Baptist Convention</a> (113,452); <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (67,637), and the <a>United Methodist Church</a> (36,424).<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> Approximately one-fifth of residents are <a>unaffiliated with any religion</a>, which includes atheists, agnostics, deists.

</p>
<p>
Catholicism is deeply rooted in New Mexico's history and culture, going back to its settlement by the Spanish in the early 17th century. The oldest Christian church in the continental U.S., and the third oldest in any U.S. state or territory, is the <a>San Miguel Mission</a> in Santa Fe, which was built in 1610.Within the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, New Mexico belongs to the <a>Ecclesiastical Province</a> of Santa Fe. The state has three <a>ecclesiastical districts</a>:<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup> the <a>Archdiocese of Santa Fe</a>, the <a>Diocese of Gallup</a>, and the <a>Diocese of Las Cruces</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Since the 1970s, New Mexico has been a leading center of <a>New Age faith</a>, attracting adherents from across the U.S.<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> The state's "thriving New Age network" encompasses various schools of <a>alternative medicine</a>, <a>holistic health</a>, <a>psychic healing</a>, and <a>new religion churches</a>; it also hosts many celebrations, festivals, and pilgrimage sites. New Mexico's popularity among practitioners of alternative medicine and religion has been linked to the ancient spirituality of its indigenous population, which emphasized spiritual connections to nature and the land.<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to a 2017 survey by the <a>Pew Research Center</a>, New Mexico ranks 18th out of the 50 U.S. states in <a>religiosity</a>, with 63% stating they believe in God with certainty and 59% considering religion to be important in their lives.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup>

In 2000 the value of oil and gas produced was $8.2 billion,<sup><a href="#ref_134">[134]</a></sup> and in 2006, New Mexico accounted for 3.4% of the crude oil, 8.5% of the dry natural gas, and 10.2% of the <a>natural gas liquids</a> produced in the United States.<sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup> However, the boom in <a>hydraulic fracturing</a> and <a>horizontal drilling</a> since the mid-2010s led to a large increase in the production of crude oil from the Permian Basin and other U.S. sources; these developments allowed the United States to again become the world's largest producer of crude oil by 2018.<sup><a href="#ref_136">[136]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_137">[137]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_138">[138]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup> New Mexico's oil and gas operations contribute to the state's above-average release of the greenhouse gas <a>methane</a>, including from a national <a>methane hot spot</a> in the <a>Four Corners</a> area.<sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_141">[141]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_142">[142]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_143">[143]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In common with other <a>states in the Western U.S.</a>, New Mexico receives royalties from the sale of federally owned land to oil and gas companies.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> It has the highest proportion of federal land with oil and gas, as well as the most lucrative: since the last amendment to the <a>U.S. Mineral Leasing Act</a> in 1987, New Mexico had by far the lowest percent of land sold for the minimum statutory amount of $2 per acre, at just 3%; by contrast, all of Arizona's federal land was sold at the lowest rate, followed by Oregon at 98% and Nevada at 84%.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> The state had the fourth-highest total acreage sold to the oil and gas industry, at about 1.1 million acres, and the second-highest number of acres currently leased fossil fuel production, at 4.3 million acres, after Wyoming's 9.2 million acres; only 11 percent of these lands, or 474,121 acres, are idle, which is the lowest among Western states.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> Nevertheless, New Mexico has had recurring disputes and discussions with the U.S. government over management and revenue rights over federal land.<sup><a href="#ref_145">[145]</a></sup>

<p>
Federal government spending is a major driver of the New Mexico economy. In 2005, the federal government spent $2.03 on New Mexico for every dollar of tax revenue collected from the state, higher than any other state in the Union.<sup><a href="#ref_146">[146]</a></sup> By 2017, federal expenditure per state tax dollar increased to $2.34, the third highest after Virginia and Kentucky.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup> New Mexico received $9,624 per resident in federal services, or roughly $20 billion more than what the state pays in federal taxes.<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup> The state governor's office estimated that the federal government spends roughly $7.8 billion annual in services such as healthcare, infrastructure development, and public welfare.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Federal employees make up 3.4% of New Mexico's labor force.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> Many federal jobs in the state relate to the military: the state hosts three air force bases (<a>Kirtland Air Force Base</a>, <a>Holloman Air Force Base</a>, and <a>Cannon Air Force Base</a>); a testing range (<a>White Sands Missile Range</a>); and an army proving ground (<a>Fort Bliss</a>'s McGregor Range). A 2005 study by <a>New Mexico State University</a> estimated that 11.65% of the state's total employment arises directly or indirectly from military spending.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> New Mexico is also home to two major federal research institutions: the <a>Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> and <a>Sandia National Laboratories</a>. The former alone accounts for 24,00 direct and indirect jobs and over $3 billion in annual federal investment.<sup><a href="#ref_150">[150]</a></sup>

<p>
New Mexico provides a number of economic incentives to businesses operating in the state, including various types of <a>tax credits</a> and <a>tax exemptions</a>. Most incentives are based on job creation: state and local governments are permitted to provide land, buildings, and infrastructure to businesses that will generate employment.<sup><a href="#ref_151">[151]</a></sup> Several municipalities impose an Economic Development <a>Gross Receipts Tax</a> (a form of Municipal Infrastructure GRT) to pay for these infrastructure improvements and for marketing their areas.<sup><a href="#ref_152">[152]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The New Mexico Finance Authority operates the New Market Tax Credits (NMTC) to provide greater access to financing for new, expanding, or relocating businesses in "highly distressed" areas (defined by metrics such as poverty above 30% and median family income below 60% of the statewide median).<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state provides financial incentives for film production.<sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_155">[155]</a></sup> One such program, enacted in 2019, provides benefits to media companies that commit to investing in the state for at least a decade and that utilize local talent, crew, and businesses.<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup> The New Mexico Film Office estimated at the end of 2007 that the incentive program had brought more than 85 film projects to the state since 2003 and had added $1.2 billion to the economy.<sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup> Data for 2021 found direct spending for film production at close to $624 million. In 2018, <a>Netflix</a> chose New Mexico for its first U.S. production hub, pledging to spend over $1 billion over the next decade to create one of the largest film studios in North America.<sup><a href="#ref_158">[158]</a></sup><a>NBCUniversal</a>  followed suit in 2019 with the opening of its own film studio and plans to employ New Mexican actors and crew members.<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup>

<p>
New Mexico is one of the largest <a>tax havens</a> in the U.S., offering numerous economic incentives and <a>tax breaks</a> on <a>personal</a> and <a>corporate income</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_160">[160]</a></sup> It does not levy taxes on<a>inheritance</a>, <a>estate</a>, or <a>sales</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup> Personal <a>income tax</a> rates range from 1.7% to 5.9% within five income brackets;<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup> the top marginal rate was increased from 4.9% in 2021 per a 2019 law.<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup><a>Active-duty military</a>  salaries are exempt from state income tax, as is income earned by Native American members of federally recognized tribes on tribal land.<sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Mexico imposes a <a>Gross Receipts Tax</a> (GRT) on many transactions, which may even include some governmental receipts. This resembles a <a>sales tax</a> but, unlike the sales taxes in many states, it applies to services as well as tangible goods. Normally, the provider or seller passes the tax on to the purchaser, however legal incidence and burden apply to the business, as an <a>excise tax</a>. GRT is imposed by <a>the state</a> and by some counties and municipalities.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup> As of 2021, the combined tax rate ranged from 5.125% to 9.063%.<sup><a href="#ref_167">[167]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Property tax</a> is imposed on <a>real property</a> by the state, by counties, and by school districts. In general, personal-use <a>personal property</a> is not subject to property taxation. On the other hand, property tax is levied on most business-use personal property. The taxable value of property is one-third the assessed value. A tax rate of about 30 <a>mills</a> is applied to the taxable value, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%. In the 2005 tax year, the average millage was about 26.47 for residential property, and 29.80 for non-residential property. Assessed values of residences cannot be increased by more than 3% per year unless the residence is remodeled or sold. Property tax deductions are available for military veterans and heads of household.<sup><a href="#ref_168">[168]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A 2021 analysis by the nonprofit Tax Foundation placed New Mexico 23rd in business tax climate; its property taxes were found to be the least burdensome in the U.S., while taxation for unemployment insurance and on corporations each ranked as the ninth least burdensome.<sup><a href="#ref_169">[169]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Wealth_and%20poverty">Wealth and poverty</h3>
<p>
New Mexico is one of the poorest states in the U.S. and has long struggled with poverty.<sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> Its poverty rate of roughly 18% is among the highest in the country, exceeded only by Louisiana and Mississippi. Nearly 30% of New Mexico's children were in poverty, which is 40% higher than the national average.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> The vast majority of births (72%) were financed by <a>Medicaid</a>, a federal healthcare program for the poor, the highest of any state.<sup><a href="#ref_171">[171]</a></sup> As of May 2021, around 44% of residents were enrolled in Medicaid.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico is one of only six states <a>without a billionaire</a>; ranks 39th in the <a>share of households</a> with more than $1 million in wealth (5%); and is among fourteen states without a Fortune 500 company.<sup><a href="#ref_172">[172]</a></sup> The state has a relatively high level of <a>income disparity</a>, with a <a>Gini coefficient</a> of 0.4769, albeit below the national average of 0.486. Household income is slightly less than $47,000, which is the fourth lowest in the U.S. The unemployment rate for June 2021 is 7.9%, tied with Connecticut as the highest in the country, and close to the peak of 8.0% for June–October 2010, following the <a>2007-2008 financial crisis</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_173">[173]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The New Mexico government has enacted several policies to alleviate chronic poverty, including approving a minimum wage increase in January 2021 and requiring paid sick leave.<sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> The state's minimum wage of $10.50 is <a>higher than</a> that of the federal government and 34 other states;<sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup> it is set to increase to $11.50 on January 1, 2022, and $12.00 on January 1, 2023.<sup><a href="#ref_175">[175]</a></sup> Additionally, counties and municipalities have set their own minimum wages; Santa Fe County enacted a "Living Wage Ordinance" on March 1, 2021, mandating $12.32.<sup><a href="#ref_176">[176]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The New Mexico Legislature is considering implementing a statewide <a>guaranteed basic income</a> program targeting poorer residents; if enacted, it would be only the second U.S. state after California with such a policy.<sup><a href="#ref_177">[177]</a></sup> In August 2021, Santa Fe announced a one-year pilot program that would provide a "stability stipend" of $400 monthly to 100 parents under the age of 30 who attend <a>Santa Fe Community College</a>;<sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup> the results of the program will determine whether the state government follows suit with its own basic income proposals.<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> Las Cruces, the state's second largest city, is officially discussing the enactment of a similar program.<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup>

New Mexico has long been an important corridor for trade and <a>migration</a>. The builders of the ruins at <a>Chaco Canyon</a> also created a radiating network of roads from the mysterious settlement.<sup><a href="#ref_180">[180]</a></sup> Chaco Canyon's trade function shifted to <a>Casas Grandes</a> in the present-day Mexican <a>state of Chihuahua</a>; however, north–south trade continued. The pre-<a>Columbian</a> trade with <a>Mesoamerican cultures</a> included northbound exotic birds, seashells and copper. Turquoise, pottery, and salt were some of the goods transported south along the <a>Rio Grande</a>. Present-day New Mexico's pre-Columbian trade is especially remarkable for being undertaken on foot. The north–south trade route later became a path for horse-drawn colonists arriving from <a>New Spain</a> as well as trade and communication; later called <i><a>El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro</a>,</i> it was among the four "royal roads" that were crucial lifelines to Spanish colonial possessions in North America.<sup><a href="#ref_181">[181]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Santa Fe Trail</a> was the 19th-century territory's vital commercial and military highway link to the Eastern United States.<sup><a href="#ref_182">[182]</a></sup> All with termini in Northern New Mexico, the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the <a>Old Spanish Trail</a> are all recognized as <a>National Historic Trails</a>. New Mexico's latitude and low passes made it an attractive east–west transportation corridor.<sup><a href="#ref_183">[183]</a></sup> As a territory, the <a>Gadsden Purchase</a> increased New Mexico's land area for the purpose of constructing a southern <a>transcontinental railroad</a>, that of the <a>Southern Pacific Railroad</a>. Another transcontinental railroad was completed by the <a>Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway</a>. The railroads essentially replaced the earlier trails, but brought on a population boom. Early transcontinental <a>auto trails</a> later crossed the state, bringing more migrants. Railroads were later supplemented or replaced by a system of highways and airports. Today, New Mexico's <a>Interstate Highways</a> approximate the earlier land routes of the Camino Real, the Santa Fe Trail and the transcontinental railroads.

New Mexico has had a problem with drunk driving, but that has lessened. According to the <i><a>Los Angeles Times</a></i>, for years the state had the highest alcohol-related crash rates in the US, but ranked 25th in alcohol-related fatal crash rates as of July 2009<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>.<sup><a href="#ref_184">[184]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Mexico had 59,927 route miles of highway as of 2000<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, of which 7,037 receive federal aid.<sup><a href="#ref_185">[185]</a></sup> In that same year there were 1,003 miles (1,614 km) of freeways, of which a thousand were the route miles of Interstate Highways <a>10</a>, <a>25</a> and <a>40</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_186">[186]</a></sup> The former number has increased with the upgrading of roads near <a>Pojoaque</a>, <a>Santa Fe</a> and <a>Las Cruces</a> to freeways. The highway traffic fatality rate was 1.9 fatalities per million miles traveled in 2000, the 13th highest rate among U.S. states.<sup><a href="#ref_187">[187]</a></sup> Notable bridges include the <a>Rio Grande Gorge Bridge</a> near <a>Taos</a>. As of 2001<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, 703 highway bridges, or one percent, were declared "structurally deficient" or "structurally obsolete".<sup><a href="#ref_188">[188]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Larger cities in New Mexico typically have some form of public transportation by road; <a>ABQ RIDE</a> is the largest such system in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_189">[189]</a></sup> Rural and intercity public transportation by road is provided by <a>Americanos USA, LLC</a>, <a>Greyhound Lines</a> and several government operators. Personal automobiles remain the primary means of transportation for most New Mexicans, especially in rural areas.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>

New Mexico has only three <a>Interstate Highways</a>: <a>Interstate 10</a> travels southwest from <a>the Arizona</a> state line near <a>Lordsburg</a> to the area between <a>Las Cruces</a> and <a>Anthony</a>, near <a>El Paso, Texas</a>; <a>Interstate 25</a> is a major north–south interstate highway starting from Las Cruces to the <a>Colorado</a> state line near <a>Raton</a>; and <a>Interstate 40</a> is a major east–west interstate highway starting from the Arizona state line west of <a>Gallup</a> to the Texas state line east from <a>Tucumcari</a>. In <a>Albuquerque</a>, I-25 and I-40 meet at a stack interchange called <a>The Big<span></span>I</a> The state is tied with Delaware, North Dakota, Puerto Rico, and Rhode Island in having the fewest primary interstate routes, which is partly a reflection of its rugged geography and sparse population.<sup><a href="#ref_190">[190]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Mexico currently has <a>15 United States Highways</a>, which account for over 2,980 miles (4,797 km) of its highway system. All but seven of its 33 counties are served by U.S. routes, with most of the remainder connected by Interstate Highways. Most routes were built in 1926 by the state government and are still managed and maintained by state or local authorities. The longest is <a>U.S. 70</a>, which spans over 448 miles (721 km) across southern New Mexico, making up roughly 15% of the state's total U.S. Highway length; the shortest is <a>U.S. 160</a>, which runs just 0.86 miles (1.38 km) across the <a>northwestern</a> corner of the state, between the <a>Arizona</a> and <a>Colorado</a> borders.

</p>
<p>
The most famous route in New Mexico, if not the United States, was <a>U.S. 66</a>, colloquially known as the nation's "Mother Road" for its scenic beauty and importance to migrants fleeing West from the <a>Dust Bowl</a> of the 1930s.<sup><a href="#ref_191">[191]</a></sup> The road crossed through <a>northern New Mexico</a>, connecting the cities of <a>Albuquerque</a> and <a>Gallup</a>, before being replaced by I-40 in 1985. Much of U.S. 66 remains in use for tourism and has been preserved for historical significance.<sup><a href="#ref_192">[192]</a></sup> Another famous route was <a>U.S. 666</a>, which ran south to north along the eastern portion of the state, serving the Four Corners area. It was known as the "Devil's Highway" due to the number <a>666</a> denoting the "<a>Number of the Beast</a>" in Christianity; this numerical designation, as well as its high fatality rate was subject to controversy, superstition, and numerous cultural references. U.S. 666 was subsequently renamed U.S. Route 491 in 2003.

</p>
<p>
Many existing and former highways in New Mexico are recognized for their aesthetic, cultural, or historical significance, particularly for tourism purposes.<sup><a href="#ref_193">[193]</a></sup> The state hosts ten out of 184 "America's Byways", which are federally designated for preservation due to their scenic beauty or national importance.<sup><a href="#ref_194">[194]</a></sup>

There were 2,354 route miles of railroads in the year 2000; this number increased by a few miles with the opening of the <a>Rail Runner</a>'s extension to Santa Fe in 2006.<sup><a href="#ref_195">[195]</a></sup> In addition to local railroads and other tourist lines, the state jointly owns and operates a heritage <a>narrow-gauge</a> steam railroad, the <a>Cumbres and Toltec Scenic Railway</a>, with the state of <a>Colorado</a> since 1970. Narrow-gauge railroads once connected many communities in the northern part of the state, from <a>Farmington</a> to Santa Fe.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><sup><span>: 110 </span></sup> No fewer than 100 railroads of various names and lineage have operated in the state at some point.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><sup><span>: 8 </span></sup> New Mexico's rail transportation system reached its height in terms of length following admission as a state; in 1914, eleven railroads operated 3124 route miles.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><sup><span>: 10 </span></sup>

Railroad surveyors arrived in New Mexico in the 1850s shortly after it became a U.S. territory.<sup><a href="#ref_197">[197]</a></sup> The first railroads incorporated in 1869,<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><sup><span>: 9 </span></sup> and the first railway became operational in 1878 with the <a>Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway</a> (ATSF), which entered via the lucrative and contested <a>Raton Pass</a>.

The rise of <a>rail transportation</a> was a major source of demographic and economic growth in the state, with many settlements expanding or being established shortly thereafter. As early as 1878, the ATSF promoted <a>tourism in the region</a> with an emphasis on Native American imagery.<sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup><sup><span>: 64 </span></sup><a>Named trains</a>  often reflected the territory they traveled: <i><a>Super Chief</a></i>, the streamlined successor to the <i>Chief</i>;<sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup><i><a>Navajo</a></i> , an early transcontinental tourist train; and <i><a>Cavern</a></i>, a through car operation connecting <a>Clovis</a> and <a>Carlsbad</a> (by the early 1950s as train 23–24), were some of the named <a>passenger trains of the ATSF</a> that connoted New Mexico,<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><sup><span>: 49–50 </span></sup><sup><a href="#ref_199">[199]</a></sup><sup><span>: 51 </span></sup> The <i>Super Chief</i> became a favorite of early Hollywood stars and among the most famous named trains in the U.S.; it was known for its luxury and exoticness, with cars bearing the name of regional Native American tribes and outfitted with the artwork of many local artists—but also for its speed: as brief as 39 hours 45 minutes westbound from Chicago to Los Angeles.<sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup>

At its height, passenger train service once connected nine of New Mexico's present <a>ten most populous cities</a> (the sole exception is <a>Rio Rancho</a>); currently, only <a>Albuquerque</a> and <a>Santa Fe</a> are connected by a rail network.<sup><a href="#ref_200">[200]</a></sup> With the decline of most <a>intercity rail</a> service in the U.S. in the late 1960s, New Mexico was left with minimal services; no less than six daily long-distance roundtrip trains, supplemented by many branch-line and local trains, served New Mexico in the early 1960s. Declines in passenger revenue, but not necessarily ridership, prompted many railroads to turn over their passenger services in truncated form to <a>Amtrak</a>, a state owned enterprise. Amtrak, also known as the National Passenger Railroad Corporation, began operating the two extant long-distance routes on May 1, 1971.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_199">[199]</a></sup>

Since 2006, a state owned, privately run <a>commuter railway</a>, the <a>New Mexico Rail Runner Express</a>, has served the <a>Albuquerque metropolitan area</a>, connecting the city proper with Santa Fe and other communities.<sup><a href="#ref_200">[200]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_204">[204]</a></sup> The system expanded in 2008 with the adding of the <a>BNSF Railway</a>'s line from <a>Belen</a> to a few miles south of Lamy.<sup><a href="#ref_205">[205]</a></sup> Phase II of Rail Runner extended the line northward to <a>Santa Fe</a> from the <a>Sandoval County</a> station, the northernmost station under Phase I service; the service now connects <a>Santa Fe</a>, <a>Sandoval</a>, <a>Bernalillo</a>, and <a>Valencia</a> counties. Rail Runner operates scheduled service seven days per week,<sup><a href="#ref_206">[206]</a></sup> connecting Albuquerque's population base and central business district to downtown Santa Fe with up to eight roundtrips in a day; the section of the line running south to <a>Belen</a> is served less frequently.<sup><a href="#ref_207">[207]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Amtrak's <i><a>Southwest Chief</a></i> passes through daily at stations in <a>Gallup</a>, Albuquerque, <a>Lamy</a>, <a>Las Vegas</a>, and <a>Raton</a>, offering connections to Los Angeles, Chicago and intermediate points.<sup><a href="#ref_208">[208]</a></sup> A successor to the <i>Super Chief</i> and <i><a>El Capitan.</a></i><sup><a href="#ref_199">[199]</a></sup><sup><span>: 115 </span></sup> the <i>Southwest Chief</i> is permitted a maximum speed of 90 mph (140 km/h) in various places on the tracks of the <a>BNSF Railway</a>;<sup><a href="#ref_209">[209]</a></sup> it also operates on <a>New Mexico Rail Runner Express</a> trackage. The <i><a>Sunset Limited</a></i> makes stops three times a week in both directions at <a>Lordsburg</a>, and <a>Deming</a>, serving Los Angeles, New Orleans and intermediate points.<sup><a href="#ref_210">[210]</a></sup> The <i>Sunset Limited</i> is the successor to the <a>Southern Pacific Railroad</a>'s train of the same name and operates exclusively on <a>Union Pacific</a> trackage in New Mexico.

<p>
New Mexico is served by two of the nation's ten <a>class I railroads</a>, which denote the highest revenue railways for freight: the <a>BNSF Railway</a> and the <a>Union Pacific Railroad</a>. Together they operate 2,200 route miles of railway in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup>

<p>
New Mexico has four <a>primary commercial airports</a> that are served by most major domestic and international airliners. <a>Albuquerque International Sunport</a> is the state's main <a>aerial port of entry</a> and by far the largest airport: It is the only one designated a medium-sized hub by the <a>Federal Aviation Administration</a>, serving millions of passengers annually. 

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Spaceport_America_terminal_-_The_Gateway_%2815094090585%29.jpg/223px-Spaceport_America_terminal_-_The_Gateway_%2815094090585%29.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The only other comparatively large airports are <a>Lea County Regional Airport</a>, <a>Roswell International Air Center</a>, and <a>Santa Fe Regional Airport</a>, which have varying degrees of service by major airlines. Most airports in New Mexico are small, <a>general aviation</a> hubs operated by municipal and county governments, and usually served solely by local and regional <a>commuter airlines</a>.

</p>
<p>
Due to its sparse population and many isolated, rural communities, New Mexico ranks among the states most reliant on <a>Essential Air Service</a>, a federal program that maintains a minimal level of scheduled air service to communities that are otherwise unprofitable.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico hosts the world's first operational and purpose-built commercial <a>spaceport</a>, <a>Spaceport America</a>, located in <a>Upham</a>, near <a>Truth or Consequences</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_213">[213]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup> It is operated by the state-backed <a>New Mexico Spaceport Authority (NMSA)</a>. <a>Rocket launches</a> began in April 2007,<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup> with the spaceport officially opening in 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_215">[215]</a></sup> Tenants include <a>HAPSMobile</a>, <a>UP Aerospace</a>, <a>SpinLaunch</a>, and <a>Virgin Galactic</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_216">[216]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Over 300 <a>suborbital</a> flights have been successfully launched from Spaceport America since 2006, with the most notable being Virgin Galactic's <a>VSS <i>Unity</i></a> on May 22, 2021, which made New Mexico the third U.S. state to launch humans into space, after <a>California</a> and <a>Florida</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_218">[218]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Constitution of New Mexico</a> was adopted by <a>referendum</a> in 1911 and establishes a <a>republican form of government</a> based on <a>popular sovereignty</a> and <a>separation of powers</a>. It includes a <a>bill of rights</a> with greater protections and freedoms in some areas than its federal counterpart; for example, victims of certain crimes have specific rights, such as to privacy, dignity, and timely adjudication of their case.<sup><a href="#ref_220">[220]</a></sup> Major state issues may be decided by popular votes, and the constitution may be amended a majority vote of both lawmakers and the electorate.<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Governmental_structure">Governmental structure</h3>
<p>
<a>Mirroring the federal system</a>, the New Mexico government consists of executive, legislative, and judicial departments. The executive is led by the <a>governor</a> and other popularly elected officials, including the <a>lieutenant governor</a> (elected on the same ticket as the governor), <a>attorney general</a>, <a>secretary of state</a>, <a>state auditor</a>, <a>state treasurer</a>, and <a>commissioner of public lands</a>. New Mexico's governor is granted more authority than those of other states, with the power to appoint most high-ranking officials in the cabinet and other state agencies.<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The legislative branch consists of the bicameral <a>New Mexico Legislature</a>, comprising the 70-member <a>House of Representatives</a> and the 42-member <a>Senate</a>. Members of the House are elected to two-year terms, while those of the Senate are elected every four years.

</p>
<p>
The judiciary is headed by the <a>New Mexico Supreme Court</a>, the state's highest court, which primarily <a>adjudicates appeals</a> from lower courts or government agencies. It is made up of five judges popularly elected every eight years with overlapping terms. Below the state supreme court is the <a>New Mexico Court of Appeals</a>, which has intermediate appellate jurisdiction statewide. New Mexico has 13 judicial districts with circuit courts of <a>general jurisdiction</a>, as well as various municipal, <a>magistrate</a>, and probate courts of <a>limited jurisdiction</a>.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico is organized into a number of local governments consisting of counties, municipalities, and special districts.<sup><a href="#ref_222">[222]</a></sup>

<p>
Since 2018, New Mexico has been led by Governor <a>Michelle Lujan Grisham</a> and Lieutenant Governor <a>Howie Morales</a>, both of the <a>Democratic Party</a>. All constitutional officers are currently Democrats, including Secretary of State <a>Maggie Toulouse Oliver</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_223">[223]</a></sup> Attorney General <a>Hector Balderas</a> ,<sup><a href="#ref_224">[224]</a></sup> State Auditor <a>Brian Colón</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_225">[225]</a></sup> State Land Commissioner <a>Stephanie Garcia Richard</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> and State Treasurer <a>Tim Eichenberg</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_227">[227]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Both chambers of the <a>New Mexico State Legislature</a> have Democratic majorities: 26 Democrats and 16 Republicans in the Senate, and 47 Democrats and 23 Republicans in the House of Representatives. Likewise the state is represented in the <a>U.S. Senate</a> by Democrats <a>Martin Heinrich</a> and <a>Ben Ray Luján</a>. The state's three delegates to the <a>U.S. House of Representatives</a> are Democrat <a>Melanie Stansbury</a>, Republican <a>Yvette Herrell</a>, and Democrat <a>Teresa Leger Fernandez</a>, representing the first, second, and third districts, respectively.

</p>
<p>
Until 2008, New Mexico was traditionally a <a>swing state</a> in presidential elections. The <a>1992 election</a> of Bill Clinton marked the first time the state was won by a Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. <a>Al Gore</a> narrowly carried the state in <a>2000</a> by 366 votes, and <a>George W. Bush</a> won in <a>2004</a> by less than 6,000 votes. The election of <a>Barack Obama</a> in <a>2008</a> marked the state's transition into <a>a reliably Democratic stronghold</a> in a largely Republican region; Obama was also the first Democratic to win a majority of New Mexico votes since Johnson.<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup> Obama won again in 2012, followed by Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Joseph Biden in 2020.

</p>
<p>
Since achieving statehood in <a>1912</a>, New Mexico has been carried by the national popular vote winner in every presidential election of the past 104 years, except <a>1976</a>, when <a>Gerald Ford</a> won the state by 2% but lost the national popular vote by 2%.<sup><a href="#ref_230">[230]</a></sup> In all but three elections—<a>1976</a>, <a>2000</a>, and <a>2016</a>—the candidate who won New Mexico won the presidency.

</p>
<p>
State politics, while decidedly Democratic leaning, have also been idiosyncratic. While registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 200,000, New Mexico voters have historically favored moderate to conservative candidates of both parties at the state and federal levels, but recent election cycles within the past decade have seen moderate incumbents replaced by progressive Democrats in urban areas like Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Cruces; and conservative Republicans being elected in the state's rural areas. <a>Grisham</a> succeeded Republican <a>Susana Martinez</a> on January 1, 2019, after she served two terms as governor from 2011 to 2019. <a>Gary Johnson</a> was governor from 1995 to 2003 as a Republican, but in <a>2012</a> and <a>2016</a> ran for president from the <a>Libertarian Party</a>. Republican Congresswoman Herrell of the state's Second District narrowly lost to <a>Democrat</a><a>Xochitl Torres Small</a>  in 2018 but retook her seat in 2020.

</p>
<p>
Democrats in the state are usually strongest in the <a>Santa Fe</a> area, parts of the <a>Albuquerque</a> metro area (such as the southeast and central areas, including the affluent Nob Hill neighborhood and the vicinity of the <a>University of New Mexico</a>), Northern and West Central New Mexico, and most of the <a>Native American</a> reservations, particularly the <a>Navajo Nation</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup> Republicans have traditionally had their strongholds in the eastern and southern parts of the state, the <a>Farmington</a> area, <a>Rio Rancho</a>, and the newly developed areas in the northwest mesa. Albuquerque's Northeast Heights have historically leaned Republican, but have become a key swing area for Democrats in recent election cycles.

<p>
Local government in New Mexico consists primarily of <a>counties</a> and <a>municipalities</a>. There are 33 counties, of which the most populous is <a>Bernalillo</a>, which contains the state's largest city, <a>Albuquerque</a>. Counties are usually governed by an elected five-member county commission, sheriff, assessor, clerk and treasurer. A municipality may call itself a <a>village</a>, <a>town</a>, or <a>city</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_231">[231]</a></sup> with no distinction in law and no correlation to any particular form of government. Municipal elections are non-partisan.<sup><a href="#ref_232">[232]</a></sup> In addition, limited local authority can be vested in special districts and landowners' associations.

</p>
<h3 id="Female_and%20minority%20representation">Female and minority representation</h3>
<p>
New Mexico is notable for electing more <a>women of color</a> to public office than any other U.S. state.<sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup> Research by the <a>Center for American Women and Politics</a> at <a>Rutgers University</a> found that two-thirds of all nonwhite women who have ever been elected governor in the U.S. are from New Mexico, including the current governor, Grisham. The state also accounts for nearly one-third of the women of color who have served in any statewide executive office, such as lieutenant governor and secretary of state, a distinction shared by only ten other states.<sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup> New Mexico also has a relatively high percentage of state legislators who are women of color, which at 16% is the sixth-highest in the country. While the trend is partly reflective of the state's disproportionately high Hispanic and indigenous populations, it also reflects longstanding cultural and political trends; in 1922, <a>Soledad Chávez Chacón</a> was the first woman elected secretary of state of New Mexico, and the first Hispanic woman elected to statewide office in the United States.

</p>
<h3 id="Law">Law</h3>
<p>
New Mexico is one of 23 states without the death penalty;<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup> on March 18, 2009, then-Governor <a>Bill Richardson</a> signed the law abolishing capital punishment following the legislature's vote the week before, making New Mexico the 15th U.S. state to do so.<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> The law went into effect July 1, 2009 and does not apply retroactively, meaning those currently awaiting execution are not affected by the ban.

</p>
<p>
New Mexico arguably has some of the least restrictive firearms laws in the country. Its constitution explicitly enshrines the right to bear arms, while state law preempts all local gun control ordinances. New Mexico residents may purchase any firearm deemed legal under federal law. There are no waiting periods under state law for picking up a firearm after it has been purchased, and there are no restrictions on magazine capacity. Additionally, New Mexico is a "shall-issue" state for <a>concealed carry</a> permits.

</p>
<p>
Before December 2013, New Mexico law was silent <a>same-sex marriage</a>. The issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level, with some county clerks issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples and others not. In December 2013, the <a>New Mexico Supreme Court</a> issued a unanimous ruling directing all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, thereby making New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriage statewide.

</p>
<p>
Based on 2008 data, New Mexico had 146 law enforcement agencies at the state, county, and municipal levels.<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup> State <a>law enforcement</a> is statutorily administered by the Department of Public Safety (DPS).<sup><a href="#ref_237">[237]</a></sup> The New Mexico State Police is a division of the DPS with jurisdiction over all crimes in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_238">[238]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_239">[239]</a></sup> As of 2008, New Mexico had over 5,000 sworn police officers, a ratio of 252 per 100,000 residents, which is roughly the same as the nation.<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Fiscal_policy">Fiscal policy</h3>
<p>
On a per capita basis, New Mexico's government has one of the largest state budgets, at $9,101 per resident.<sup><a href="#ref_240">[240]</a></sup> As of 2017, the state had an <a>S&P Global Rating</a> of  AA+, denoting a very strong capacity to meet financial commitments alongside a very low credit risk.

Due to its relatively low population, in combination with numerous federally funded research facilities, New Mexico had the highest concentration of <a>Ph.D</a>. holders of any state in 2000.<sup><a href="#ref_241">[241]</a></sup><a>Los Alamos County</a> , which hosts the <a>eponymous national laboratory</a>, leads the state in the most post secondary degree holders, at 38.7% of residents, or 4,899 of 17,950.<sup><a href="#ref_242">[242]</a></sup> However, the state routinely ranks near the bottom in studies of the quality of primary and secondary school education.<sup><a href="#ref_243">[243]</a></sup> It places 34th in public education spending, but by some metrics ranks last in overall performance and quality, with some of the highest dropout rates and lowest math and reading scores.<sup><a href="#ref_244">[244]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By national standards, New Mexico has one of the highest concentrations of persons who did not finish high school or have some college education, albeit by a low margin. A little over 14% of residents did not have a high school diploma, compared to the national rate of 11.39%, the fifth lowest out of 52 U.S. states and territories. Almost a quarter of people over 25 (23.9%) have not completed college,<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> compared with 21% of the nation as a whole.<sup><a href="#ref_245">[245]</a></sup> New Mexico ranks among the bottom ten states in the proportion of residents with bachelor's degrees or higher (27.67%), but 21st in Ph.D. earners (12.15%); the national average is 33.13% and 12.79%, respectively.

</p>
<p>
In 2018, a state judge issued a landmark ruling that "New Mexico is violating the constitutional rights of at-risk students by failing to provide them with sufficient education", in particularly those with indigenous, non-English-speaking, and low-income backgrounds.<sup><a href="#ref_246">[246]</a></sup> The court had ordered the governor and Legislature to provide an adequate system by April 2019;<sup><a href="#ref_247">[247]</a></sup> in response, New Mexico increased teacher salaries, funded an extended school year, and expanded prekindergarten childhood education programs, while developing budget formula for delivering more funding to schools that serve at-risk and low-income students.<sup><a href="#ref_248">[248]</a></sup> Nevertheless, many activists and public officials contest the sufficiency of these efforts, particularly with respect to Native American schools and students.<sup><a href="#ref_248">[248]</a></sup>

New Mexican culture is a unique fusion of indigenous, Spanish, Hispanic, and American influences. In addition to thousands of years of indigenous heritage, the state was among the earliest territories in the Americas to be settled by Europeans; centuries of Spanish and then Mexican settlement, often intermingled with an enduring indigenous presence, are reflected in the state's demographics, <a>toponyms</a>, cuisine, dialect, and identity. The uniqueness of New Mexico's culture and image, relative to the rest of the United States, is reflected in part by the fact that many Americans are unaware the state is part of the country.<sup><a href="#ref_257">[257]</a></sup> This phenomenon is variably treated with frustration, amusement, or even as a source of pride as evidence of the state's distinct character and heritage.<sup><a href="#ref_258">[258]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_259">[259]</a></sup>

The state is an important center of Native American culture, with a Native American population of close to 200,000 in 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_260">[260]</a></sup> Both the <a>Navajo</a> and <a>Apache</a> share <a>Athabaskan</a> origin. The Apache and some <a>Ute</a> live on federal <a>reservations</a> in the state. With 16 million acres (6,500,000<span></span><a>ha</a>), mostly in neighboring <a>Arizona</a>, the reservation of the <a>Navajo Nation</a> ranks as the largest in the United States. <a>Pueblo Indians</a> live in <a>pueblos</a> scattered throughout the state.

</p>
<p>
Almost half of New Mexicans claim Hispanic origin; many are descendants of colonial settlers called <a>Hispanos or Neomexicanos</a>, who settled mostly in the north of the state between the 16th and 18th centuries. By contrast, the majority of Mexican immigrants reside in the southern part of the state. Some percentage Hispanos claim <a>Jewish ancestry</a> through descendance from <i><a>conversos</a></i> or <a>Crypto-Jews</a> among early Spanish colonists.<sup><a href="#ref_261">[261]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Many New Mexicans speak a unique dialect of Spanish. Because of the historical isolation of New Mexico from other speakers of the Spanish language, some of the vocabulary of <a>New Mexican Spanish</a> is unknown to other Spanish speakers. It uses numerous Native American words for local features and includes anglicized words that express American concepts and modern inventions.

<p>
Albuquerque has the <a>New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science</a>, the <a>National Hispanic Cultural Center</a>, and the <a>National Museum of Nuclear Science & History</a>, as well as hosts the famed annual <a>Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta</a> every fall.

<p>
The earliest New Mexico artists whose work survives today are the Mimbres Indians, whose black and white pottery could be mistaken for modern art, except for the fact that it was produced before 1130 CE. See <a>Mimbres culture</a>. Many examples of this work can be seen at the <a>Deming Luna Mimbres Museum</a><sup><a href="#ref_262">[262]</a></sup> and at the <a>Western New Mexico University</a> Museum.<sup><a href="#ref_263">[263]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A large artistic community thrives in <a>Santa Fe</a>, and has included such people as <a>Bruce Nauman</a>, <a>Richard Tuttle</a>, <a>John Connell</a> and <a>Steina Vasulka</a>. The capital city has several art museums, including the <a>New Mexico Museum of Art</a>, Museum of Spanish Colonial Art, <a>Museum of International Folk Art</a>, <a>Museum of Indian Arts and Culture</a>, <a>Museum of Contemporary Native Arts</a>, <a>SITE Santa Fe</a> and others. Colonies for artists and writers thrive, and the small city teems with art galleries. In August, the city hosts the annual <a>Santa Fe Indian Market</a>, which is the oldest and largest juried Native American art showcase in the world. Performing arts include the renowned <a>Santa Fe Opera</a> which presents five operas in repertory each July to August, the <a>Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival</a> held each summer, and the restored <a>Lensic Theater</a> a principal venue for many kinds of performances. Santa Fe is also home to <a>Frogville Records</a>, an indie record label. The weekend after Labor Day boasts the burning of <a>Zozobra</a>, a fifty-foot (15<span></span>m) marionette, during <a>Fiestas de Santa Fe</a>.

<p>
Art is also a frequent theme in <a>Albuquerque</a>, New Mexico's largest city. The <a>National Hispanic Cultural Center</a> has held hundreds of performing arts events, art showcases, and other events related to Spanish culture in New Mexico and worldwide in the centerpiece Roy E Disney Center for the Performing Arts or in other venues at the 53-acre facility. New Mexico residents and visitors alike can enjoy performing art from around the world at Popejoy Hall on the campus of the University of New Mexico. Popejoy Hall hosts singers, dancers, Broadway shows, other types of acts, and Shakespeare.<sup><a href="#ref_264">[264]</a></sup> Albuquerque also has the unique and memorable <a>KiMo Theater</a> built in 1927 in the <a>Pueblo Revival Style architecture</a>. The KiMo presents live theater and concerts as well as movies and <a>simulcast</a> operas.<sup><a href="#ref_265">[265]</a></sup> In addition to other general interest theaters, Albuquerque also has the African American Performing Arts Center and Exhibit Hall which showcases achievements by people of African descent<sup><a href="#ref_266">[266]</a></sup> and the <a>Indian Pueblo Cultural Center</a> which highlights the cultural heritage of the <a>First Nations</a> people of New Mexico.<sup><a href="#ref_267">[267]</a></sup>

New Mexico holds strong to its Spanish heritage. Old Spanish traditions such <a>zarzuelas</a> and <a>flamenco</a> are popular;<sup><a href="#ref_268">[268]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_269">[269]</a></sup>  the University of New Mexico is the only institute of higher education in the world with a program dedicated to flamenco.<sup><a href="#ref_270">[270]</a></sup> Flamenco dancer and native New Mexican <a>María Benítez</a> founded the Maria Benítez Institute for Spanish Arts "to present programs of the highest quality of the rich artistic heritage of Spain, as expressed through music, dance, visual arts, and other art forms". There is also the Festival Flamenco Internacional de Alburquerque held each year in which native Spanish and New Mexican flamenco dancers perform at the University of New Mexico.

</p>
<p>
In the mid-20th century, there was a thriving <a>Hispano</a> school of literature and scholarship being produced in both English and Spanish. Among the more notable authors were: <a>Angélico Chávez</a>, <a>Nina Otero-Warren</a>, Fabiola Cabeza de Baca, Aurelio Espinosa, Cleofas Jaramillo, <a>Juan Bautista Rael</a>, and <a>Aurora Lucero-White Lea</a>. As well, writer <a>D. H. Lawrence</a> lived near <a>Taos</a> in the 1920s, at the <a>D. H. Lawrence Ranch</a>, where there is a shrine said to contain his ashes.

<p>
New Mexico's strong Spanish, Native American, and Wild West frontier motifs have provided material for many authors in the state, including the internationally recognized <a>Rudolfo Anaya</a> and <a>Tony Hillerman</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_271">[271]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Silver City</a>, originally a mining town, is now a major hub and exhibition center for large numbers of artists, visual and otherwise.<sup><a href="#ref_272">[272]</a></sup> Another former mining town turned art haven is <a>Madrid, New Mexico</a>, which was brought to national fame as the filming location for the 2007 movie <i><a>Wild Hogs</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_273">[273]</a></sup> Las Cruces, in southern New Mexico, has a museum system affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution Affiliations Program,<sup><a href="#ref_274">[274]</a></sup> and hosts variety of cultural and artistic opportunities for residents and visitors.<sup><a href="#ref_275">[275]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Owing to a combination of financial incentives, low cost, and geographic diversity, New Mexico has long been a popular setting or filming location for various films and television series. In addition to <i>Wild Hogs</i>, other movies filmed in New Mexico include <i><a>Sunshine Cleaning</a></i> and <i><a>Vampires</a></i>. Various seasons of the <a>A&E</a>/<a>Netflix</a> series <i><a>Longmire</a></i> were filmed in several New Mexico locations, including <a>Las Vegas</a>, <a>Santa Fe</a>, <a>Eagle Nest</a>, and <a>Red River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_276">[276]</a></sup> The widely acclaimed TV show <i><a>Breaking Bad</a></i> and its spin-off <i><a>Better Call Saul</a></i> were both set and filmed in and around Albuquerque.<sup><a href="#ref_277">[277]</a></sup>

Owing to its millennia of habitation and over two centuries of Spanish colonial rule, New Mexico features a significant number of sites with historical and cultural significance. Forty-six locations across the state are listed by the <a>U.S. National Register of Historic Places</a>, the 18th highest of any state.<sup><a href="#ref_281">[281]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Mexico has nine of the country's 84 national monuments, which are sites federally protected by presidential proclamation; this is the second-highest number after Arizona.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> The monuments include some of the earliest to have been created: <a>El Morro</a> and <a>Gila Cliff Dwellings</a>, proclaimed in 1906 and 1907, respectively, both of which preserve the state's ancient indigenous heritage.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Mexico is one of 20 states with a <a>UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>, and among only eight with more than one.
