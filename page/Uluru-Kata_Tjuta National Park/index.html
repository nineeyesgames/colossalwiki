<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
Uluru is recognised as "Australia's most natural icon"<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and has become a focal point for Australia and the world's acknowledgement of Australian indigenous culture. The sandstone <a>monolith</a> stands 348 metres (1,142 ft) high with most of its bulk below the ground. To <a>Anangu</a> (local indigenous people), Uluru is a place name and this "Rock" has a number of different landmarks where many ancestral beings have interacted with the landscape and/or each other, some even believed to still reside here. <a>Kata Tjuta</a>, meaning 'many heads', is a sacred place relating to knowledge that is considered very powerful and dangerous, only suitable for initiated men. It is made up of a group of 36 conglomerate rock domes that date back 500 million years.

</p>
<p>
<a>Anangu</a> are the traditional <a>Aboriginal</a> owners of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park. They believe that their culture was created at the beginning of time by ancestral beings. Uluru and Kata Tjuta provide physical evidence of feats performed during the creation period. They often lead walking tours to inform visitors about the local flora and fauna, bush foods and the Aboriginal <a>Dreamtime</a> stories of the area.

</p>
<p>
The <i><a>Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act</a></i> was passed in 1976, meaning that after many years Aboriginal law and land rights were finally recognised in <a>Australian law</a>. Nine years later on 26 October 1985 the traditional owners were presented with the freehold title deeds for the park, who, in turn, leased the land back to the Australian Government through the <a>Director of National Parks</a> (formerly the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service) for 99 years.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Director is assisted by <a>Parks Australia</a>, a division of the Australian Department of the Environment and Energy. Since hand-back, Anangu and Parks Australia staff have worked together to manage the park. This process of working together is known as 'joint management'.

</p>
<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
Uluru and Kata Tjuta were formed about 350 million years ago during the <a>Alice Springs Orogeny</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Anangu</a> have connected to the area for thousands of years and some records suggested that they may have lived there for more than 10,000 years.

</p>
<p>
Europeans came to the <a>western desert area</a> of Australia in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the <a>Overland Telegraph</a> Line in 1872.

</p>
<p>
In separate expeditions, <a>William Ernest Powell Giles</a> and <a>William Christie Gosse</a> were the first European explorers to this area. In 1872 while exploring the area, Ernest Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from near <a>Kings Canyon</a> and called it <a>Mount Olga</a>, while the following year Gosse saw Uluru and named it <a>Ayers Rock</a> after Sir Henry Ayers, the <a>Chief Secretary of South Australia</a>. Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for pastoralism.

</p>
<p>
In the late 19th century, pastoralists attempted to re-establish themselves in areas adjoining the South-Western/Petermann Reserve and interaction between Anangu and white people became more frequent and more violent. Due to the effects of grazing and droughts, bush food stores were depleted. Competition for these resources created conflict between pastoralists and Anangu. As a result, police patrols became more frequent. 

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Uluru_2.JPG/220px-Uluru_2.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Between 1918 and 1921 large adjoining areas of <a>South Australia</a>, <a>Western Australia</a> and the <a>Northern Territory</a> were declared as <a>Aboriginal reserves</a>, as sanctuaries for a nomadic people who had virtually no contact with white people. In 1920, part of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve (commonly known as the South-Western or Petermann Reserve) by the <a>Australian Government</a> under the <i><a>Aboriginals Ordinance 1918</a></i>.

</p>
<p>
During the <a>Depression</a> in the 1930s, the Anangu became involved in dingo scalping with "doggers" who introduced Anangu to European foods and ways. The first tourists visited the Uluru area in 1936.

</p>
<p>
The Ayers Rock National Park was recognised in 1950, and in the same year an Alice Springs resident Len Tuit accompanied a group of schoolboys on a trip to Uluru. He recognised the enormous tourism potential of the rock and began offering regular tours in 1955, with guests camping in tents and drinking water carted in from Curtin Springs. Kata Tjuta was added to the national park to create the Ayers Rock-Mount Olga National Park in 1958. The first permanent accommodation was constructed the same year, while a new airstrip allowed the first fly-in, fly-out tour groups.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1958, in response to pressures to support tourism enterprises, the area that is now the park was excised from the Petermann Aboriginal Reserve to be managed by the Northern Territory Reserves Board as the Ayers Rock – Mt Olga National Park. The first ranger was the legendary central Australian figure, <a>Bill Harney</a><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The site came to attention on 17 August 1980 when two-month-old <a>Azaria Chamberlain</a> was found dead as a result of being taken by a dingo.

</p>
<p>
On 1 October 2015, traditional owners declared more than 50,000 square kilometres (19,000 sq mi) of Aboriginal freehold land surrounding the National Park an <a>Indigenous Protected Area</a> (IPA) named Katiti Petermann Indigenous Protected Area. As the fourth largest IPA on <a>mainland Australia</a>, it is larger than Switzerland, and completes a huge network of nine IPAs in Central Australia.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>
These domed rock formations are composed of <a>conglomerate</a>, a <a>sedimentary</a> rock consisting of cobbles and boulders of varying rock types including <a>granite</a> and <a>basalt</a>, cemented by a matrix of <a>sandstone</a>. The crevasses are due to erosion, primarily by water. Although it is a dry region, the large area of these domes collects a lot of rainwater, which runs off in steep waterfalls during rain.

</p>
<p>
From a geological point of view, analysis of Uluru-Kata Tjuta and Watarrka National Parks reveals an awe-inspiring history. 500 million years ago, the entire area was covered by an inland sea and over many centuries, sand and mud fell to the bottom of the sea, creating rock and <a>sandstone</a>. Kata Tjuta's domes are the eroded remains of sedimentary rock from the seabed, while Uluru is a <a>relict</a> of the coarse grained, mineral-rich sandstone called <a>arkose</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Climate_and%20seasons">Climate and seasons</h3>
<p>
The park receives an average rainfall of 307.7 millimeters per year. Temperature extremes in the park have been
recorded at 45 °C (113 °F) during the summer and −5 °C (23 °F) during winter nights. <a>UV</a> readings on
most extreme summer days reach between 11 and 15.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> While the Central Australian environment may at first seem stark – a barren landscape supporting spectacular rock formations – closer inspection reveals it as a complex <a>ecosystem</a>, full of life.

</p>
<p>
Plant and animal life have adapted to the area's extreme conditions and it subsequently supports some of the most unusual flora and fauna on the planet. Many of these have long been a valuable source of <a>bush tucker</a> and medicine for local <a>Aboriginal</a> people.

</p>

The Aboriginal Australians recognise six seasons:

<p>
The park is ranked as one of the most significant arid land <a>ecosystems</a> in the world. As a Biosphere Reserve under the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Program, it joins at least 11 other reserves in Australia and an international network aiming to preserve the world's major ecosystem types.

<p>
Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park <a>flora</a> represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia. A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region. There are many rare and <a>endemic</a> plants at Uluru and <a>Kata Tjuta</a>. A number of other species, while found elsewhere in central Australia, may be endangered within the park.

</p>
<p>
The desert flora has adapted to the harsh conditions. The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall. Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce. Plants are an important part of <a>Tjukurpa</a>, and there are ceremonies for each of the major plant foods. Many plants are associated with ancestral beings. Collection of plant foods remains a culturally important activity, reinforcing traditional links with country and Tjukurpa.

</p>
<p>
Flora in Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park can be broken into the following categories:

</p>
<ul><li>Punu – trees</li><li>Puti – shrubs</li><li><i>Tjulpun-tjulpunpa</i> – flowers</li><li>Ukiri – grasses</li></ul>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Desert_Oaks3484.jpg/220px-Desert_Oaks3484.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Trees such as the <a>mulga</a> and centralian <a>bloodwood</a> are used to make tools such as spearheads, <a>boomerangs</a> and bowls. The red <a>sap</a> of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds.

</p>
<p>
Others such as the <a>river red gum</a> and <a>corkwood trees</a> like <a>grevillea</a> and hakeas are a source of food themselves. The white flaky crust from river red gum leaves can be rolled into balls and eaten like a lolly and the nectar from the flowers of the corkwood trees can produce a sweet drink.

</p>
<p>
The witchetty bush looks like a shrubby mulga with broad round-ended leaves. Witchetty grubs are found in the roots of this tree.
<a>Daisies</a> and other ground flowers bloom after rain and during the winter. Others such as the wattles bloom as spring approaches. Anangu collect wattle seed, crush and mix it with water to make an edible paste which they eat raw. To make <a>damper</a>, the seeds are parched with hot sand so their skins can be removed before they are ground for flour.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Spinifex_grass.jpg/220px-Spinifex_grass.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The prickly hard <a>spinifex</a> hummocks have enormous root systems that prevent desert sands shifting. The hummock roots spread underground beyond the prickly clump and deeply into the soil, forming an immense cone. Anangu use a resin gathered from the gummy spinifex to make <a>gum</a>. They thresh the spinifex until the resin particles fall free. These particles are heated until they fuse together to form a moldable black tar which Anangu work while warm. The gum is used for hunting and working implements, and to mend breaks in stone and wooden implements.

</p>
<p>
The naked woolybutt and native <a>millet</a> have seeds that are important Anangu foods. Women rub the seedheads from their stalks and then separate the seeds from the chaff by skilful winnowing. Using grinding stones, they then grind the seeds to flour for damper.

</p>
<p>
There are several rare and endangered species in the park. Most of them like adder's tongue ferns (<a>Ophioglossaceae</a> sp.) are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the <a>monoliths</a>, which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion.

</p>
<p>
Since the first Europeans arrived, 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park, representing about 6.4% of the total park flora. Some such as perennial buffel grass (<i>Cenchrus ciliaris</i>) were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion. It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water and nutrient rich drainage lines. Where infestation is dense, it prevents the growth of native grasses – a source of food for animals and humans. A few others such as burrgrass were brought in accidentally, carried on cars and people.

</p>
<h3 id="Fauna">Fauna</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Black-footed_Rock-wallaby%28small%29.jpg/170px-Black-footed_Rock-wallaby%28small%29.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Historically 46 species of native <a>mammal</a> are known to have been living in the Uluru region; there are currently 21 according to recent surveys. Anangu allege that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape. Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as <a>mallee fowl</a>, <a>brushtail possum</a>, rufous hare <a>wallaby</a> or <i><a>mala</a></i>, <a>bilby</a>, <a>burrowing bettong</a> and the <a>black-footed rock wallaby</a>
</p>
<p>
The <a>mulgara</a>, the only mammal listed as vulnerable, is mostly restricted to the transitional sandplain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru, to the northern boundary of the park, and into Ayers Rock Resort. This very important area also contains the <a>marsupial mole</a>, <a>woma python</a>, or kuniya, and great desert skink.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Brushtail_possum.jpg/220px-Brushtail_possum.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/93/Perentie_Lizard_Perth_Zoo_SMC_Spet_2005.jpg/220px-Perentie_Lizard_Perth_Zoo_SMC_Spet_2005.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The bat population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Most of the bats forage for aerial <a>prey</a> within an airspace extending only 100 m or so from the rock face.

</p>
<p>
The park has a very rich reptile fauna of high conservation significance, with 73 species having been reliably recorded. Four species of frog are <a>abundant</a> at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains. The great desert <a>skink</a> is listed as <a>vulnerable</a>.

</p>
<p>
Anangu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on Anangu land elsewhere. Hunting is largely confined to the <a>red kangaroo</a>, Australian <a>bustard</a>, <a>emu</a> and lizard such as the sand <a>goanna</a> and <a>perentie</a>.

</p>
<p>
The pressures exerted by introduced predators and herbivores on the original mammalian fauna of Central Australia were a major factor in the extinction of about 40% of the native species.

</p>
<p>
Of the 27 mammal species found in the park, six are introduced: the <a>house mouse</a>; camel; fox; cat; dog; and rabbit. These species are distributed throughout the park but their densities are greatest in the rich water run-off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Large numbers of rabbits led to the introduction of a rabbit control program in 1989. This has resulted in a great reduction of the rabbit population, a noticeable vegetation recovery and a reduction in <a>predator</a> numbers. Camels have been implicated in the reduction of plant species, particularly the more succulent species such as the <a>quandong</a>. The house mouse is a successful invader of disturbed environments and habitats that have lost native rodents. Subjective estimates of cat and fox numbers have been collected in association with the rabbit control program. The national threat abatement programs may provide the framework for controlling them. Anangu knowledge and tracking skills are invaluable in the management of these introduced animals. The park regulations prohibit visitors bringing animals into the park unless they are a <a>guide dog</a> for the blind or deaf, or a permit is granted by the Director of National Parks.

</p>
<p>
Iconic birds of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park include the <a>pied butcherbird</a>, <a>black breasted buzzard</a>, <a>black-faced woodswallow</a> and <a>crimson chat</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Fire_management">Fire management</h3>
<p>
Fires have been a part of central desert land management for thousands of years and have shaped the landscape, habitats, survival of animals and patterns of vegetation. Controlled burning usually takes place during the winter months due to the cooler weather while natural fires mostly occur in the early summer months. They are usually started by the lightning strikes of dry electrical storms from the north west. When the storms arrive the weather is usually hot, dry and windy – conditions ideal for raging fires. Damage can be severe and widespread. Destructive bushfires burnt much of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and luxury accommodation at the Ayers Rock Resort was destroyed in 2002–03.

</p>
<p>
Traditional burning of the Uluru area stopped when Anangu were driven from the region during the 1930s. During the 1940s rainfall was good and vegetation flourished. The 1950 fire, fed by the fuel grown during the previous 20 years, wiped out about one third of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park's vegetation. The pattern repeated itself and in 1976 two fires burnt 76% of the park. Over the same period more species of medium-sized mammals became extinct around Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Today most fires in the park are lit following land management patterns traditionally practiced by Anangu. Traditional fire and land management skills enable Anangu to burn in a way that will give the desired result. These skills are vital for the preservation of the central Australian ecology.

The park is open year-round from sunrise to sunset. These times will vary depending on the season. Occasionally parts of the park may be temporarily closed for cultural reasons.

</p>
<p>
The park entrance fee for Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is $25 per person 16 years of age and over. This fee is valid for 3 consecutive days and helps to maintain the park. One quarter goes back to <a>Anangu</a>, the
<a>traditional owners</a>, to help them maintain their families and the Mutitjulu community.

</p>
<p>
The Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Cultural Centre by recognised Australian architect <a>Gregory Burgess</a> located inside the park on the main road to Uluru provides an introduction to Tjukurpa (law, knowledge, religion, philosophy), Anangu art, Anangu way of life (traditional and current), history, languages, wildlife and joint management of the park. There are also <a>art</a> and <a>craft</a> demonstrations, <a>bush tucker</a> sessions, plants walks and cultural presentations.

</p>
<p>
There are displays featuring photo collages, oral history sound panels, Pitjantjatjara language learning interactives, soundscapes, videos and artefacts. Explanations are provided in Pitjantjatjara, English, Italian, Japanese, German and French. A touch wall for visually impaired people ensures that the messages are accessible to everyone. Entry to the Cultural Centre is free.

</p>
<p>
The Walkatjara Art Centre is owned and operated by the local Aboriginal artists from the Mutitjulu Community. Most weekdays the Walkatjara Artists come to paint and work in the Art Room and receive a percentage of sales.

<p>
The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts. It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation-related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park. In 1975 a reservation of 104 square kilometres of land beyond the park's northern boundary, 15 kilometres from Uluru, was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated airport, to be known as Yulara. The campground within the park was closed in 1983 and the motels finally closed in late 1984, coinciding with the opening of the Yulara resort. In 1992 the majority interest in the Yulara Resort held by the Northern Territory Government was sold and the resort was renamed 'Ayers Rock Resort'.

The listing of Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> ensures the park remains a world-class destination for both its <a>cultural</a> and <a>natural heritage</a>. Visitors will continue to have a unique cultural experience at the park and leave knowing that the park is managed according to cultural practices that date back tens of thousands of years.

</p>
<p>
Since the park was listed as a <a>World Heritage Site</a>, annual visitor numbers have risen to over 400,000 visitors in the year 2000. Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits. It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are a number of sightseeing and cultural tours to Uluru that offer walks that visitors can take around the major attractions of the park. The Base Walk is one of the best ways to see Uluru. Other walks surrounding Uluru include the Liru Walk, Mala Walk and Kuniya walk, while the sunrise and sunset viewing areas provide great photo opportunities.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>

The <a>Aboriginal</a> community of <a>Mutitjulu</a> is inside the park area, but tourists must stay at the resorts in <a>Yulara</a>, just outside the national park. Ayers Rock Resort in Yulara offers a range of accommodation from camp sites to five-star luxury. There are also several dining options, a supermarket and a range of tour operators. The national park and town are served by <a>Connellan Airport</a>.

</p>
<p>
Slightly further afield is the luxury tented accommodation at Longitude 131, with views of Uluru from the tents.

</p>
<p>
Camping is not permitted in the park.
