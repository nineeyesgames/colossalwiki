<b>Kyrgyzstan</b> (<a>Kyrgyz</a>: <span>Кыргызстан</span>, <small><a>romanized</a>: </small><i>Kyrgyzstan</i>; <a>Russian</a>: <span>Кыргызстан</span>), more rarely called <i>Kirghizia</i> (<a>Russian</a>: <span>Киргизия</span>), officially the <b>Kyrgyz Republic</b> (<a>Kyrgyz</a>: <span>Кыргыз Республикасы</span>, <small><a>romanized</a>: </small><i>Kyrgyz Respublikasy</i>; <a>Russian</a>: <span>Киргизская Республика</span>, <small><a>romanized</a>: </small><i>Kirgizskaya Respublika</i>), is a mountainous <a>landlocked country</a> in <a>Central Asia</a>. Kyrgyzstan is bordered by <a>Kazakhstan</a> to <a>the north</a>, <a>Uzbekistan</a> to <a>the west</a>, <a>Tajikistan</a> to <a>the south</a>, and China to <a>the east.</a> Its <a>capital</a> and <a>largest city</a> is <a>Bishkek</a>. Ethnic <a>Kyrgyz</a> make up the majority of the country's six million people, followed by significant minorities of <a>Uzbeks</a> and <a>Russians</a>. The <a>Kyrgyz language</a> is closely related to other <a>Turkic languages</a>, although <a>Russian</a> remains spoken and is a co-official language. Ninety percent of Kyrgyzstan's population are Muslim, with the majority of its population following <a>Sunni Islam</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> In addition to its Turkic origins, Kyrgyz culture bears elements of <a>Iranic</a>, <a>Mongolian</a> and <a>Russian</a> influence.

</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan's history spans a variety of cultures and empires. Although geographically isolated by its highly mountainous terrain, Kyrgyzstan has been at the crossroads of several great civilizations as part of the <a>Silk Road</a> and other commercial routes. Inhabited by a succession of tribes and clans, Kyrgyzstan has periodically fallen under larger domination. <a>Turkic</a><a>nomads</a> , who trace their ancestry to many <a>Turkic states</a> such as the <a>First</a> and <a>Second Turkic Khaganates</a>, have inhabited the country throughout its history. In the 13th century, Kyrgyzstan was conquered by the <a>Mongols</a>; it regained independence but was invaded by <a>Kalmyks</a>, <a>Manchus</a> and <a>Uzbeks</a>. In 1876, it became part of the <a>Russian Empire</a>, and in 1936, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic was formed to become a constituent republic of the <a>Soviet Union</a>. Following <a>Mikhail Gorbachev</a>'s democratic reforms in the USSR, in 1990 pro-independence candidate <a>Askar Akayev</a> was elected president. On 31 August 1991, Kyrgyzstan declared independence from Moscow and a democratic government was established. Kyrgyzstan attained sovereignty as a nation state after the <a>breakup of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991.

</p>
<p>
After independence, Kyrgyzstan was officially a <a>unitary</a><a>presidential republic</a> , then between 2010 and 2021 was officially a <a>unitary</a><a>parliamentary republic</a> , although it gradually developed an executive president and was governed as a <a>semi-presidential republic</a> before reverting to a presidential system in 2021. Throughout its existence, the country has continued to endure ethnic conflicts,<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> revolts,<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> economic troubles,<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> transitional governments<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> and political conflict.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan is a member of the <a>Commonwealth of Independent States</a>, the <a>Eurasian Economic Union</a>, the <a>Collective Security Treaty Organization</a>, the <a>Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a>, the <a>Organisation of Islamic Cooperation</a>, the <a>Turkic Council</a>, the <a>Türksoy</a> community and the <a>United Nations</a>. It is a <a>developing country</a> ranked 120th in the <a>Human Development Index</a>, and the second poorest country in Central Asia. The country's <a>transition economy</a> is heavily dependent on deposits of <a>gold</a>, <a>coal</a> and <a>uranium</a>.

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
<i>Kyrgyz</i> is believed to have been derived from the Turkic word for "forty", about the forty clans of <a>Manas</a>, a legendary hero who united forty regional clans against the <a>Uyghurs</a>. Literally, Kyrgyz means "We are forty". At the time, in the early 9th century AD, the Uyghurs dominated much of Central Asia (including Kyrgyzstan), Mongolia, and parts of modern-day Russia and China.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><i><a>-Stan</a></i>  is a suffix in <a>Persian</a> meaning "place of" or "country".

</p>
<p>
The 40-ray sun on the <a>flag of Kyrgyzstan</a> is a reference to those same forty tribes and the graphical element in the sun's center depicts the wooden crown, called tunduk, of a <a>yurt</a>—a portable dwelling traditionally used by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia.

</p>
<p>
The country's official name is <i>"Kyrgyz Republic,"</i> used in international arenas and foreign relations.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> In the English-speaking world, the spelling <i>Kyrgyzstan</i> is commonly used, while its former name <i>Kirghizia</i><sup><a href="#ref_a">[a]</a></sup> is rarely used.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>
According to David C. King, <a>Scythians</a> were early settlers in present-day Kyrgyzstan.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Kyrgyz</a> state reached its greatest expansion after defeating the <a>Uyghur</a> Khaganate in 840 AD.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> From the 10th century the Kyrgyz migrated as far as the <a>Tian Shan</a> range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years.

</p>
<p>
In the 12th century the Kyrgyz dominion had shrunk to the <a>Altay</a> Range and <a>Sayan Mountains</a> as a result of the <a>Mongol expansion</a>. With the rise of the <a>Mongol Empire</a> in the thirteenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. The Kyrgyz peacefully became a part of the Mongol Empire in 1207.

</p>
<p>
<a>Issyk Kul Lake</a> was a stopover on the <a>Silk Road</a>, a land route for traders, merchants, and other travelers from the Far East to Europe.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Caravanserai_Tash_Rabat_on_Silk_Road_in_Kyrgyzstan.jpg/170px-Caravanserai_Tash_Rabat_on_Silk_Road_in_Kyrgyzstan.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Kyrgyz tribes were overrun in the 17th century by the Mongols, in the mid-18th century by the Manchurian <a>Qing dynasty</a>, and in the early 19th century by the Uzbek <a>Khanate of Kokand</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Russian_conquest">Russian conquest</h3>
<p>
In the late nineteenth century, the eastern part of what is today Kyrgyzstan, mainly the <a>Issyk-Kul Region</a>, was ceded to the <a>Russian Empire</a> by Qing China through the <a>Treaty of Tarbagatai</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> The territory, then known in Russian as "Kirghizia", was formally incorporated into the Empire in 1876. The Russian takeover was met with numerous revolts, and many of the Kyrgyz opted to relocate to the <a>Pamir Mountains</a> and <a>Afghanistan</a>.

</p>
<p>
In addition, the suppression of the <a>1916 rebellion</a> against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Since many ethnic groups in the region were (and still are) split between neighboring states at a time when borders were more porous and less regulated, it was common to move back and forth over the mountains, depending on where life was perceived as better; this might mean better rains for pasture or better government during oppression.

</p>
<h3 id="Soviet_Kyrgyzstan">Soviet Kyrgyzstan</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Bischkek.jpg/220px-Bischkek.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Soviet power was initially established in the region in 1919, and the <a>Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast</a> was created within the <a>Russian SFSR</a> (the phrase Kara-Kirghiz was used until the mid-1920s by the Russians to distinguish them from the <a>Kazakhs</a>, who were also referred to as Kirghiz). On 5 December 1936, the <a>Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic</a> was established as a constituent <a>Union Republic</a> of the <a>Soviet Union</a>.

</p>
<p>
During the 1920s, Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational, and social life. Literacy was greatly improved, and a great focus was put on Kyrgyz <a>national identity</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> Economic and social development also was notable.

</p>
<p>
The early years of <a>glasnost</a> had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, <i>Literaturny Kirghizstan</i>, by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.

</p>
<p>
According to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of <a>Frunze</a> (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other <a>Slavic</a> nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the <a>Jewish Autonomous Oblast</a>).

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Stamps_of_Kyrgyzstan%2C_2011-05.jpg/220px-Stamps_of_Kyrgyzstan%2C_2011-05.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
In June 1990, ethnic tensions between <a>Uzbeks</a> and Kyrgyz surfaced in the <a>Osh Oblast</a> (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The tensions between Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks in Osis led to 186 deaths.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek <a>collective farms</a> for housing development triggered the <a>Osh Riots</a>. A state of emergency and curfew were introduced<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> and <a>Askar Akayev</a>, the youngest of five sons born into a family of collective farm workers (in northern Kyrgyzstan), was elected president in October of that same year. 
By then, the <a>Kyrgyzstan Democratic Movement</a> (KDM) had developed into a significant political force with support in Parliament. On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Despite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a "renewed federation". Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.

</p>
<p>
On 19 August 1991, when the <a>State Emergency Committee</a> assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President <a>German Kuznetsov</a> announced their resignations from the <a>Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the <b>Republic of Kyrgyzstan</b>.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Independence">Independence</h3>
<p>
In October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent Republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community. Finally, on 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new <a>Commonwealth of Independent States</a>. Kyrgyzstan gained full independence a few days later on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the <a>United Nations</a> and the <a>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic.

</p>
<p>
In 2005, a popular uprising known as the "<a>Tulip Revolution</a>", took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forced President <a>Askar Akayev</a>'s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was formed under President <a>Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> and Prime Minister <a>Feliks Kulov</a>. The nation's capital was looted during the protests.

</p>
<p>
Political stability appeared to be elusive, however, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to <a>organized crime</a> jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother's seat in a by-election. All four are reputed to have been directly involved in major illegal business ventures.<sup>[<i><a><span>according to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup>
On 6 April 2010, <a>civil unrest broke out</a> in the town of <a>Talas</a> after a demonstration against government corruption and increased living expenses. The protests became violent, spreading to Bishkek by the following day. Protesters attacked President Bakiyev's offices, as well as state-run radio and television stations. There were conflicting reports that Interior Minister <a>Moldomusa Kongatiyev</a> had been beaten. On 7 April 2010, President Bakiyev imposed a state of emergency. Police and special services arrested many opposition leaders. In response, protesters took control of the internal security headquarters (former <a>KGB</a> headquarters) and a state television channel in the capital, Bishkek.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Reports by Kyrgyzstan government officials indicated that at least 75 people were killed and 458 hospitalized in bloody clashes with police in the capital.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> Reports say that at least 80 people died as a result of clashes with police. A transition government, led by former foreign minister <a>Roza Otunbayeva</a>, by 8 April 2010 had taken control of <a>state media</a> and government facilities in the capital, but Bakiyev had not resigned from office.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
President Bakiyev returned to his home in <a>Jalal-Abad</a> and stated his terms of resignation at a press conference on 13 April 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> On 15 April 2010, Bakiyev left the country and flew to neighboring <a>Kazakhstan</a>, along with his wife and two children. The country's provisional leaders announced that Bakiyev signed a formal letter of resignation prior to his departure.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Prime Minister <a>Daniar Usenov</a> accused Russia of supporting the protests; this accusation was denied by Russian Prime Minister, <a>Vladimir Putin</a>. Opposition members also called for the closing of the US-controlled <a>Manas Air Base</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Russia's President <a>Dmitry Medvedev</a> ordered measures to ensure the safety of Russian nationals and tighten security around Russian sites in Kyrgyzstan to protect them against possible attacks.

</p>
<p>
The <a>2010 South Kyrgyzstan ethnic clashes</a> occurred between the two main ethnic groups—the Uzbeks and Kyrgyz—in <a>Osh</a>, the second-largest city in the country, on 11 June 2010. The clashes incited fears that the country could be heading towards a civil war.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7d/Suusamyr_Valley_%283968060227%29.jpg/220px-Suusamyr_Valley_%283968060227%29.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Finding it difficult to control the situation, Otunbayeva, the interim leader, sent a letter to the Russian president, Dimitry Medvedev, asking him to send Russian troops to help the country control the situation. Medvedev's Press Attaché, <a>Natalya Timakova</a>, said in a reply to the letter, "It is an internal conflict and for now Russia does not see the conditions for taking part in its resolution". The clashes caused a shortage of food and other essential commodities with more than 200 killed and 1,685 people hurt, as of 12 June 2010<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>. The Russian government, however, said it would be sending humanitarian aid to the troubled nation.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to local sources, there was a clash between two local gangs and it did not take long for the violence to spread to the rest of the city. There were also reports that the armed forces supported ethnic Kyrgyz gangs entering the city, but the government denied the allegations.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The riots spread to neighboring areas, and the government declared a state of emergency in the entire southern <a>Jalal-Abad</a> region. To control the situation, the interim government gave special shoot-to-kill powers to the security forces. The Russian government decided to send a battalion to the country to protect Russian facilities.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Otunbayeva accused the family of Bakiyev of "instigating the riots".<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> AFP reported "a veil of smoke covering the whole city". Authorities in neighboring <a>Uzbekistan</a> said at least 30,000 Uzbeks had crossed the border to escape the riots.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> Osh became relatively calm on 14 June 2010, but Jalal-Abad witnessed sporadic incidents of arson. The entire region was still under a state of emergency as Uzbeks were reluctant to leave their houses for fear of attacks by the mobs. The <a>United Nations</a> decided to send an envoy to assess the situation.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/From_Sary_Tash_to_Osh%2C_Kyrgyzstan_%2843654601644%29.jpg/220px-From_Sary_Tash_to_Osh%2C_Kyrgyzstan_%2843654601644%29.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
<a>Temir Sariyev</a>, deputy chief of the interim government, said there were local clashes and that it was not possible [for the government] to fully control the situation. He added that there were not sufficient security forces to contain the violence. Media agencies reported on 14 June 2010 that the Russian government was considering a request by the Kyrgyz government. An emergency meeting of the <a>Collective Security Treaty Organisation</a> (CSTO) was held on the same day (14 June) to discuss the role it could play in helping to end the violence.
Ethnic violence waned, according to the Kyrgyz government, by 15 June 2010 and Kyrgyz president Roza Otunbayeva held a news conference that day and declared that there was no need for Russia to send in troops to quell the violence. There were at least 170 people left dead by 15 June 2010 but Pascale Meige Wagner of the <a>International Committee of the Red Cross</a> said the [official] death toll was an underestimate. The UN High Commissioner told reporters in <a>Geneva</a> that evidence suggested that the violence seemed to have been staged up.
Ethnic Uzbeks threatened to blow up an oil depot in Osh if they failed to get guarantees of protection. The United Nations said it believed that the attacks were "orchestrated, targeted and well-planned". Kyrgyz officials told the media that a person suspected to be behind the violence in Jalal-Abad had been detained.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 2 August 2010, a Kyrgyz government commission began investigating the causes of the clashes. Members of the National Commission, led by former parliament speaker Abdygany Erkebaev, met with people from the predominantly ethnic Uzbek villages of Mady, Shark, and Kyzyl-Kyshtak in the Kara-Suu district of Osh Oblast. This National Commission, including representatives of many ethnic groups, was established by a presidential decree.

</p>
<p>
President Roza Otunbayeva also said in August 2010 that an international commission would be formed to investigate the clashes.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> The international commission conducted an extensive investigation and prepared a report – The Independent international commission of inquiry into the events in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010 (KIC).<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> It stated that "The Provisional Government, which had assumed power two months before the events, either failed to recognize or underestimated the deterioration in inter-ethnic relations in southern Kyrgyzstan". The KIC concluded that the "Provisional Government had the responsibility to ensure that the security forces were adequately trained and appropriately equipped to deal with situations of civil unrest" but were unable to take necessary measures.

</p>
<p>
As of today, Kyrgyzstan celebrates its Independence Day annually on August 31, the anniversary of its declaration of independence in 1991. Since independence, Kyrgyzstan has made some impressive developments such as creating genuinely free news media and fostering an active political opposition.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In late April 2021, a <a>conflict over water</a> escalated into one of the most serious <a>border clashes</a> between Kyrgyzstan and <a>Tajikistan</a> since independence in 1991.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>

Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in <a>Central Asia</a>, bordering <a>Kazakhstan</a>, China, <a>Tajikistan</a> and <a>Uzbekistan</a>. It lies between latitudes <a>39°</a> and <a>44° N</a>, and longitudes <a>69°</a> and <a>81° E</a>. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into <a>closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea</a>. The mountainous region of the <a>Tian Shan</a> covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as "the Switzerland of Central Asia", as a result),<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> with the remainder made up of valleys and basins.

<p>
<a>Issyk-Kul Lake</a>, or Ysyk-Köl in <a>Kyrgyz</a>, in the north-eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after <a>Titicaca</a>. The lowest point is in <a>Kara-Daryya</a> (Karadar'ya) at 132 meters and the highest peaks are in the Kakshaal-Too range, forming the Chinese border. Peak <a>Jengish Chokusu</a>, at 7,439 m (24,406 ft), is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over 7,000 m (22,966 ft) in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for <a>hydro-electricity</a>.

</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including <a>gold</a> and <a>rare-earth metals</a>. Due to the country's predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the <a>Fergana Valley</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Bishkek</a> in the north is the capital and largest city, with 937,400 inhabitants (as of 2015<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>). The second city is the ancient town of <a>Osh</a>, located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan. The principal river is the <a>Kara Darya</a>, which flows west through the Fergana Valley into Uzbekistan. Across the border in Uzbekistan it meets another major Kyrgyz river, the <a>Naryn</a>.

</p>
<p>
The confluence forms the <a>Syr Darya</a>, which originally flowed into the <a>Aral Sea</a>. As of 2010<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, it no longer reaches the sea, as its water is withdrawn upstream to irrigate cotton fields in <a>Tajikistan</a>, <a>Uzbekistan</a>, and southern <a>Kazakhstan</a>. The <a>Chu River</a> also briefly flows through Kyrgyzstan before entering Kazakhstan.

</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan contains seven terrestrial ecosystems: <a>Tian Shan montane conifer forests</a>, <a>Alai-Western Tian Shan steppe</a>, <a>Gissaro-Alai open woodlands</a>, <a>Tian Shan foothill arid steppe</a>, <a>Pamir alpine desert and tundra</a>, <a>Tian Shan montane steppe and meadows</a>, and <a>Central Asian northern desert</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> It had a 2019 <a>Forest Landscape Integrity Index</a> mean score of 8.86/10, ranking it 13th globally out of 172 countries.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>

<p>
The climate varies regionally. The low-lying <a>Fergana Valley</a> in the southwest is <a>subtropical</a> and extremely hot in <a>summer</a>, with temperatures reaching 40 °C (104 °F) The northern <a>foothills</a> are <a>temperate</a> and the <a>Tian Shan</a> varies from dry <a>continental</a> to <a>polar climate</a>, depending on elevation. In the coldest areas temperatures are sub-zero for around 40 days in winter, and even some <a>desert</a> areas experience constant snowfall in this period. In the lowlands the temperature ranges from around −6 °C (21 °F) in January to 24 °C (75 °F) in July.

<p>
There is one <a>exclave</a>, the tiny village of <a>Barak</a><sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> (population 627), in the <a>Fergana Valley</a>. The village is surrounded by <a>Uzbek</a> territory. It is located on the road from <a>Osh</a> (Kyrgyzstan) to Khodjaabad (Uzbekistan) about 4 kilometres (2 miles) north-west from the Kyrgyz–Uzbek border in the direction of <a>Andijan</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> Barak is administratively part of <a>Kara-Suu District</a> in Kyrgyzstan's <a>Osh Region</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are four Uzbek <a>enclaves</a> within Kyrgyzstan. Two of them are the towns of <a>Sokh</a>, with an area of 325 km<sup>2</sup> (125 sq mi) and a population of 42,800 in 1993—although some estimates go as high as 70,000 (99% are <a>Tajiks</a>, the remainder <a>Uzbeks</a>); and <a>Shakhimardan</a> (also known as Shahimardan, Shohimardon, or Shah-i-Mardan, area 90 km<sup>2</sup> (35 sq mi) and a population of 5,100 in 1993; 91% are Uzbeks, the remainder <a>Kyrgyz</a>); the other two are the tiny territories of Chong-Kara (roughly 3 km (2 mi) long by 1 km (0.6 mi) wide) and Jangy-ayyl (a dot of land barely 2–3 km (1–2 mi) across). Chong-Kara is on the <a>Sokh river</a>, between the Uzbek border and the Sokh enclave. Jangy-ayyl is about 60 kilometres (37 mi) east of <a>Batken</a>, in a northward projection of the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border near <a>Khalmion</a>.

<p>
There are also two enclaves belonging to <a>Tajikistan</a>: <a>Vorukh</a> (exclave area between 95–130 km<sup>2</sup> (37–50 sq mi), population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz, distributed among 17 villages), located 45 kilometres (28 mi) south of <a>Isfara</a> on the right bank of the river <a>Karavshin</a>, and a small settlement near the Kyrgyz railway station of <a>Kairagach</a>.

<p>
The <a>1993 constitution</a> defines the form of government as a democratic <a>unicameral</a> republic. The executive branch includes a president and prime minister. The parliament currently is unicameral. The judicial branch comprises a Supreme Court, local courts and a Chief Prosecutor.

</p>
<p>
In March 2002, in the southern district of <a>Aksy</a>, five people protesting the <a>arbitrary arrest</a> of an opposition politician were shot dead by police, sparking nationwide protests. President <a>Askar Akayev</a> initiated a constitutional reform process which initially included the participation of a broad range of government, civil and social representatives in an open dialogue, leading to a February 2003 referendum marred by voting irregularities.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Bishkek_P9170503_192_%2839204123095%29.jpg/220px-Bishkek_P9170503_192_%2839204123095%29.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The amendments to the constitution approved by the referendum resulted in stronger control by the president and weakened the parliament and the Constitutional Court. Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless <a>coup</a> on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president <a>Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> (see: <a>Tulip Revolution</a>).

</p>
<p>
On 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the <a>presidential election</a> in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country's constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>

<p>
Kyrgyzstan is also a member of the <a>Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe</a> (OSCE), a league of 56 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia. As an OSCE participating State, Kyrgyzstan's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the <a>U.S. Helsinki Commission</a>.

</p>
<p>
In December 2008, the state-owned broadcast <a>KTRK</a> announced that it would require prior submission of <a>Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</a> programmes, which KTRK are required to retransmit according to a 2005 agreement.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> KTRK had stopped retransmitting RFE/RL programming in October 2008, a week after it failed to broadcast an RFE/RL programme called 'Inconvenient Questions' which covered the October elections, claiming to have lost the missing material. President Bakiyev had criticised this programme in September 2008, while KTRK told RFE/RL that its programming was too negative. <a>Reporters Without Borders</a>, which ranks Kyrgyzstan 111th out of 173 countries on its <a>Press Freedom Index</a>, strongly criticised the decision.

</p>
<p>
On 3 February 2009, President <a>Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> announced the imminent closure of the <a>Manas Air Base</a>, the only US military base remaining in Central Asia.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> The closure was approved by Parliament on 19 February 2009 by a vote of 78–1 for the government-backed bill.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> However, after much behind-the-scenes negotiation between Kyrgyz, Russian and American diplomats, the decision was reversed in June 2009. The Americans were allowed to remain under a new contract, whereby rent would increase from $17.4 million to $60 million annually.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>

Kyrgyzstan is among the fifty countries in the world with the highest perceived level of corruption: the 2016 <a>Corruption Perception Index</a> for Kyrgyzstan is 28 on a scale of 0 (most corrupt) to 100 (least corrupt).<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2010 another revolution erupted in the country (see: <a>April uprising</a>). President Kurmanbek Bakiyev together with his relatives including his son <a>Maksim</a><sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> and brother <a>Janish</a>—were forced to flee to Kazakhstan and then sought asylum in <a>Belarus</a>. <a>Roza Otunbayeva</a>, who was appointed interim president, announced that she did not intend to run for the <a>Presidential elections in 2011</a>. The election was held in November and won by the then-Prime Minister <a>Almazbek Atambayev</a>, leader of the <a>Social Democratic Party</a>, and Atambayev was sworn in as president on 1 December 2011. <a>Omurbek Babanov</a> was appointed prime minister on the same day and was confirmed on 23 December 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In October 2017, <a>Sooronbay Jeenbekov</a>, a former prime minister backed by incumbent Almazbek Atambayev, was elected as the new President of Kyrgyzstan.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> On 7 August 2019, the Special Forces of Kyrgyzstan launched an operation against the residence of former President Almazbek Atambayev, supposedly based on charges of corruption made against him.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> In a meeting of the <a>Security Council</a>, President Jeenbekov accused Atambayev of violating the constitution.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> In October 2020, President Sooronbay Jeenbekov resigned after protests caused by irregularities in parliamentary <a>elections</a> on 4 October 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> In January 2021, <a>Sadyr Japarov</a> was elected as the new president after winning the presidential <a>election</a> by landslide.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In April 2021, the majority of voters approved in the constitutional <a>referendum</a> a new constitution that will give new powers to the president, significantly strengthening the power of the presidency.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic</a> serves as the <a>central bank</a> of Kyrgyzstan.

</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan was the ninth poorest country in the former <a>Soviet Union</a>, and is today the second poorest country in <a>Central Asia</a> after Tajikistan. 22.4% of the country's population lives below the poverty line.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Despite the backing of major Western lenders, including the <a>International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF), the <a>World Bank</a> and the <a>Asian Development Bank</a>, Kyrgyzstan has had economic difficulties following independence. Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic's transition to a demand economy.

</p>
<p>
The government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a <a>value-added tax</a>. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a <a>market economy</a>. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan's accession to the <a>World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) on 20 December 1998.

</p>
<p>
The Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn <a>Armenia</a>, <a>Azerbaijan</a> and <a>Tajikistan</a>, as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate <a>fiscal</a> revenues and providing an adequate <a>social safety net</a>. <a>Remittances</a> of around 800,000 Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia contribute to the economy however in recent years, remittances have decreased.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Agriculture</a> is an important sector of the economy in Kyrgyzstan (see <a>agriculture in Kyrgyzstan</a>). By the early 1990s, the private agricultural sector provided between one-third and one-half of some harvests. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 35.6% of GDP and about half of employment. Kyrgyzstan's terrain is mountainous, which accommodates <a>livestock</a> raising, the largest agricultural activity, so the resulting <a>wool</a>, <a>meat</a> and <a>dairy products</a> are major commodities. Main crops include <a>wheat</a>, <a>sugar beets</a>, <a>potatoes</a>, <a>cotton</a>, <a>tobacco</a>, <a>vegetables</a>, and <a>fruit</a>. As the prices of imported <a>agrichemicals</a> and <a>petroleum</a> are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.

</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible <a>petroleum</a> and <a>natural gas</a> reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of <a>coal</a>, <a>gold</a>, <a>uranium</a>, <a>antimony</a>, and other valuable metals. <a>Metallurgy</a> is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the <a>Kumtor Gold Mine</a> and other regions. The country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of <a>hydroelectric energy</a>.

</p>
<p>
The principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, <a>Kazakhstan</a>, and <a>Uzbekistan</a>. After Beijing launched the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, China has expanded its economic presence and initiated a number of sizable infrastructure projects in Kyrgyzstan.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Kyrgyz Republic ranks last in Central Asia in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Kyrgyz Republic ranked number 118 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, unchanged from 2013 (see <a>Networked Readiness Index</a>).

</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan is ranked 78th among countries for economic freedom by the Heritage Institute.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a significant negative impact on the Kyrgyz economy that is reliant on services, remittances and natural resources. As a result, in order to mitigate the economic shock and preserve much of the development progress achieved in recent years the World Bank will provide support by financing several projects in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>

Kyrgyzstan's population is estimated at 6,586,600 in August 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> Of those, 34.4% are under the age of 15 and 6.2% are over 65. The country is <a>rural</a>: only about one-third of the population live in urban areas. The average <a>population density</a> is 25 people per km<sup>2</sup>.

<h3 id="Ethnic_groups">Ethnic groups</h3>
<p>
The nation's largest <a>ethnic group</a> are the <a>Kyrgyz</a>, a <a>Turkic</a> people, who comprise 73.3% of the population. Other ethnic groups include <a>Russians</a> (5.6%) concentrated in the north and <a>Uzbeks</a> (14.6%) living in the south. Small but noticeable minorities include <a>Dungans</a> (1.1%), <a>Uyghurs</a> (1.1%), <a>Tajiks</a> (1.1%), <a>Kazakhs</a> (0.7%), and <a>Ukrainians</a> (0.5%) and other smaller ethnic minorities (1.7%).<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> The country has over 80 ethnic groups.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Kyrgyz have historically been semi-<a>nomadic</a> herders, living in round tents called <a>yurts</a> and tending <a>sheep</a>, <a>horses</a> and <a>yaks</a>. This nomadic tradition continues to function seasonally (see <a>transhumance</a>) as herding families return to the high mountain pasture (or <i>jailoo</i>) in the summer. The sedentary Uzbeks and Tajiks traditionally have farmed lower-lying irrigated land in the <a>Fergana valley</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan has undergone a pronounced change in its ethnic composition since independence.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> The percentage of ethnic Kyrgyz has increased from around 50% in 1979 to over 70% in 2013, while the percentage of ethnic groups, such as Russians, Ukrainians, Germans and Tatars dropped from 35% to about 7%.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> Since 1991, a large number of <a>Germans</a>, who in 1989 numbered 101,000 persons, have emigrated to Germany.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>

<p>
<a>Kyrgyz</a> is the state language of Kyrgyzstan. <a>Russian</a> is additionally an official language. 
Kyrgyzstan is one of five former Soviet republics to have Russian as a <a>de jure</a><a>official language</a> , along with Russia, <a>Belarus</a>, <a>Kazakhstan</a>, and <a>Tajikistan</a><sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup>. After the division of the Soviet Union into countries, <a>Kyrgyz</a> was adopted as the "state language" of Kyrgyzstan in 1991. Kyrgyzstan adopted Russian as an "official language" in 1997. The languages have different legal statuses.

</p>
<p>
<a>Kyrgyz</a> is a <a>Turkic</a> language of the <a>Kipchak</a> branch, closely related to <a>Kazakh</a>, <a>Karakalpak</a>, and <a>Nogay Tatar</a>. It was written in the <a>Arabic alphabet</a> until the twentieth century. The <a>Latin script</a> was introduced and adopted on Stalin's orders in 1928, and was subsequently replaced by <a>Cyrillic script</a> in 1941.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> A reformed Perso-Arabic alphabet, created by Kyrgyz intellectual and scientist: <a>Kasym Tynystanov</a>, is the official script of the Kyrgyz language in the People's Republic of China.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> As a result of the pending language reform in neighboring Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan will be the only independent <a>Turkic-speaking country</a> in a few years that exclusively uses the Cyrillic alphabet.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2009,<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> 4.1 million people spoke Kyrgyz as native or second language and 2.5 million spoke Russian as native or second language. <a>Uzbek</a> is the second most common native language with 700,000 native speakers.

</p>
<p>
Russian TV media enjoy enormous popularity in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the Russian-speaking <a>city of Bishkek</a> and the <a>Chuy Region</a>. Russian media outlets have an enormous impact on public opinion in Kyrgyzstan, especially in areas such as <a>human rights</a> and international political developments.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Many business and political affairs are carried out in Russian. Until recently, Kyrgyz remained a language spoken at home and was rarely used during meetings or other events. However, most parliamentary meetings today are conducted in Kyrgyz, with simultaneous interpretation available for those not speaking Kyrgyz.

<p>
<a>Islam</a> is the dominant religion of Kyrgyzstan. The CIA World Factbook estimates that as of 2017, 90% of the population is Muslim, with the majority being <a>Sunni</a>; 7% are Christian, including 3% <a>Russian Orthodoxy</a>, and the remainder are other religions.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> A 2009 <a>Pew Research Center</a> report indicated 86.3% of Kyrgyzstan's population adhering to Islam.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup> The great majority of Muslims are Sunni, adhering to the <a>Hanafi school</a> of thought,<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> although a 2012 Pew survey report showed that only 23% of respondents to a questionnaire chose to identify themselves as Sunni, with 64% volunteering that they were "just a Muslim".<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup> There are a few <a>Ahmadiyya</a> Muslims, though unrecognised by the country.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During Soviet times, <a>state atheism</a> was encouraged. Today, however, Kyrgyzstan is a <a>secular state</a>, although Islam has exerted a growing influence in politics.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup> For instance, there has been an attempt to arrange for officials to travel on <i><a>hajj</a></i> (the pilgrimage to <a>Mecca</a>) under a tax-free arrangement.

</p>
<p>
While <a>Islam in Kyrgyzstan</a> is more of a cultural background than a devout daily practice for many, public figures have expressed support for restoring religious values. For example, <a>human rights</a><a>ombudsman</a>  Tursunbay Bakir-Ulu noted, "In this era of independence, it is not surprising that there has been a return to spiritual roots not only in Kyrgyzstan, but also in other post-communist republics. It would be immoral to develop a market-based society without an ethical dimension."<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Bishkek_church_01.jpg/170px-Bishkek_church_01.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Additionally, <a>Bermet Akayeva</a>, the daughter of <a>Askar Akayev</a>, the former President of Kyrgyzstan, stated during a July 2007 interview that Islam is increasingly taking root across the nation.<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> She emphasized that many <a>mosques</a> have recently been built and that the Kyrgyz are increasingly devoting themselves to Islam, which she noted was "not a bad thing in itself. It keeps our society more moral, cleaner."<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> There is a contemporary <a>Sufi</a> order present which adheres to a somewhat different form of Islam than the orthodox Islam.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Mosque_under_construction_in_Kyrgyzstan.jpg/220px-Mosque_under_construction_in_Kyrgyzstan.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The other faiths practiced in Kyrgyzstan include <a>Russian Orthodox</a> and <a>Ukrainian Orthodox</a> versions of <a>Christianity</a>, practiced primarily by <a>Russians</a> and <a>Ukrainians</a> respectively. A community of 5000 to 10,000 Jehovah's Witnesses gather in both Kyrgyz and Russian-speaking congregations, as well as some Chinese- and Turkish-speaking groups.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> A small minority of ethnic Germans are also Christian, mostly <a>Lutheran</a> and <a>Anabaptist</a> as well as a <a>Roman Catholic</a> community of approximately 600.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A few <a>Animistic</a> traditions survive, as do influences from <a>Buddhism</a> such as the tying of <a>prayer flags</a> onto sacred trees, though some view this practice rooted within <a>Sufi</a> Islam.<sup><a href="#ref_125">[125]</a></sup> There are also a small number of <a>Bukharian Jews</a> living in Kyrgyzstan, but during the collapse of the <a>Soviet Union</a> most fled to other countries, mainly the United States and Israel. In addition, there is a small community of <a>Ashkenazi Jews</a>, who fled to the country from eastern Europe during the <a>Second World War</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_126">[126]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 6 November 2008, the Kyrgyzstan parliament unanimously passed a law increasing the minimum number of adherents for recognizing a religion from 10 to 200. It also outlawed "aggressive action aimed at <a>proselytism</a>", and banned religious activity in schools and all activity by unregistered organizations. It was signed by President <a>Kurmanbek Bakiyev</a> on 12 January 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There have been several reported police raids against peaceful minority religious meetings,<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup> as well as reports of officials planting false evidence,<sup><a href="#ref_129">[129]</a></sup> but also some court decisions in favour of religious minorities.<sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup>

<p>
Illegal, but still practiced, is the tradition of <a>bride kidnapping</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_132">[132]</a></sup> It is debatable whether bride kidnapping is actually traditional. Some of the confusion may stem from the fact that <a>arranged marriages</a> were traditional, and one of the ways to escape an arranged marriage was to arrange a consensual "kidnapping."<sup><a href="#ref_133">[133]</a></sup>

<a>Wrestling</a> is also very popular. In the <a>2008 Summer Olympic Games</a>, two athletes from Kyrgyzstan won medals in <a>Greco-Roman wrestling</a>: <a>Kanatbek Begaliev</a> (silver) and <a>Ruslan Tyumenbayev</a> (bronze).<sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Ice hockey</a> was not as popular in Kyrgyzstan until the first <a>Ice Hockey Championship</a> was organized in 2009.

There are 77 public schools in Bishkek (capital city) and more than 200 in the rest of the country. There are 55 higher educational institutions and universities in Kyrgyzstan, out of which 37 are state institutions.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In September 2016, the <a>University of Central Asia</a> was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.<sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup>

<p>
Kyrgyzstan is home to 1,066 libraries.<sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup> The <a>National Library of the Kyrgyz Republic</a> is the oldest library in the country, which was established in 1934. Kyrgyz Libraries are working towards expanding access to communities, evident in projects such as the signing of the <a>Marrakesh VIP Treaty</a> and the <a>Open access</a> Portal.<sup><a href="#ref_141">[141]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_142">[142]</a></sup>

<p>
Transport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country's alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.

</p>
<p>
Additional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the <a>Soviet</a> period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. <a>Horses</a> are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan's road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported <a>fuel</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Airports">Airports</h3>
<p>
At the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The <a>Kyrgyzstan Air Company</a> provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.

<h3 id="Banned_airline%20status">Banned airline status</h3>
<p>
Kyrgyzstan appears on the European Union's <a>list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines</a>. This means that no airline that is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards that fail to meet European regulations.<sup><a href="#ref_143">[143]</a></sup> No EU airline has flights to Kyrgyzstan (as of 2020). Travel between the European Union and Kyrgyzstan includes changing aircraft, most often in Moscow or Istanbul.

</p>
<h3 id="Railways">Railways</h3>
<p>
The <a>Chuy Valley</a> in the north and the <a>Ferghana valley</a> in the south were endpoints of the <a>Soviet Union</a>'s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about 370 km (230 mi) (1,520 mm (59.8 in) broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as <a>Tashkent</a>, <a>Almaty</a>, and the cities of Russia.

</p>
<p>
There are vague plans about extending rail lines from <a>Balykchy</a> in the north and/or from <a>Osh</a> in the south into China, but the cost of construction would be enormous.

<p>
With support from the <a>Asian Development Bank</a>, a major road linking the north and southwest from <a>Bishkek</a> to <a>Osh</a> has recently been completed. This considerably eases communication between the two major population centres of the country—the <a>Chuy Valley</a> in the north and the <a>Fergana Valley</a> in the South. An offshoot of this road branches off across a 3,500 meter <a>pass</a> into the <a>Talas Valley</a> in the northwest. Plans are now being formulated to build a major road from Osh into China.
