<b>Samoa</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>s</span><span>ə</span><span>ˈ</span><span>m</span><span>ɔː</span><span>ə</span></span>/</a></span></span>), officially the <b>Independent State of</b><b>Samoa</b>  (<a>Samoan</a>: <i>Malo Saʻoloto Tutoʻatasi o Sāmoa</i>; <a>Samoan</a>: <i>Sāmoa</i>, <small>IPA: </small><span><a>[ˈsaːmoa]</a></span>) and until 1997 known as <b>Western Samoa</b>, is a <a>Polynesian</a><a>island country</a>  consisting of two main islands (<a>Savai'i</a> and <a>Upolu</a>), two smaller, inhabited islands (<a>Manono</a> and <a>Apolima</a>), and several smaller, uninhabited islands, including the <a>Aleipata Islands</a> (<a>Nu'utele</a>, <a>Nu'ulua</a>, <a>Fanuatapu</a> and <a>Namua</a>). Samoa is located 64 kilometres west of <a>American Samoa</a>, 889 kilometres northeast of <a>Tonga</a> (closest foreign country), 1,152 kilometres northeast of <a>Fiji</a>, 483 kilometres east of <a>Wallis and Futuna</a>, 1,151 kilometres southeast of <a>Tuvalu</a>, 519 kilometres south of <a>Tokelau</a>, 4,190 kilometres southwest of <a>Hawaii</a> and 610 kilometres northwest of <a>Niue</a>.

Samoa is a <a>unitary</a><a>parliamentary democracy</a>  with <a>eleven administrative divisions</a>. The <a>sovereign state</a> is a member of the <a>Commonwealth of Nations</a>. Western Samoa was admitted to the <a>United Nations</a> on 15 December 1976.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> Because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, pre-20th-century European explorers referred to the entire <a>island group</a> (which includes <a>American Samoa</a>) as the "Navigator Islands."<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> The country was a colony of the German Empire from 1899 to 1915, then came under a joint British and New Zealand colonial administration until 1 January 1962, when it became independent.

<h3 id="Early_Samoa">Early Samoa</h3>
<p>
Samoa was discovered and settled by the Samoans' Lapita ancestors (Austronesian people who spoke <a>Oceanic languages</a>). New Zealand scientists have dated the earliest human remains found in Samoa to between roughly 2900 and 3500 years ago. The remains were discovered at a <a>Lapita</a> site at <a>Mulifanua</a>, and the scientists' findings were published in 1974.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> The Samoans' origins have been studied in modern times through scientific research on Polynesian <a>genetics</a>, <a>linguistics</a> and <a>anthropology</a>. Although this research is ongoing, a number of theories have been proposed. One theory is that the original Samoans were <a>Austronesians</a> who arrived during a final period of eastward expansion of the Lapita peoples out of Southeast Asia and <a>Melanesia</a> between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga, and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate inter-island voyaging and intermarriage between pre-colonial Samoans, Fijians, and Tongans. Notable figures in Samoan history included the <a>Tui Manu'a</a> line, Queen <a>Salamasina</a>, <a>King Fonoti</a> and the four tama-a-aiga: <a>Malietoa</a>, <a>Tupua Tamasese</a>, <a>Mata'afa</a> and <a>Tuimalealiifano</a>. <a>Nafanua</a> was a famous woman warrior who was deified in ancient Samoan religion and whose patronage was highly sought after by successive Samoan rulers.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Today, all of Samoa is united under its two principal royal families: the Sā Malietoa of the ancient Malietoa lineage that defeated the Tongans in the 13th century; and the Sā Tupua, Queen Salamasina's descendants and heirs who ruled Samoa in the centuries that followed her reign. Within these two principal lineages are the four highest titles of Samoa - the elder titles of Malietoa and Tupua Tamasese of antiquity as well as the newer Mata'afa and Tuimalealiifano titles who rose to prominence in 19th century wars that preceded the colonial period.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> These four titles form the apex of the Samoan matai system as it stands today.

</p>
<p>
Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. <a>Jacob Roggeveen</a>, a Dutchman, was the first known non-Polynesian to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by French explorer <a>Louis-Antoine de Bougainville</a>, who named them the <i>Navigator Islands</i> in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s, which is when English <a>missionaries</a>, whalers and traders began arriving.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Samoa_in%20the%201800s">Samoa in the 1800s</h3>
<p>
Visits by American trading and <a>whaling</a> vessels were important in the early economic development of Samoa. The <a>Salem</a> brig <i>Roscoe</i> (Captain Benjamin Vanderford), in October 1821, was the first American trading vessel known to have called, and the <i>Maro</i> (Captain Richard Macy) of <a>Nantucket</a>, in 1824, was the first recorded United States whaler at Samoa.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> The whalers came for fresh drinking water, firewood and provisions, and later, they recruited local men to serve as crewmen on their ships. The last recorded whaler visitor was the <i>Governor Morton</i> in 1870.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Christian missionary work in Samoa began in 1830 when <a>John Williams</a> of the <a>London Missionary Society</a> arrived in <a>Sapapali'i</a> from the <a>Cook Islands</a> and <a>Tahiti</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> According to Barbara A. West, "The Samoans were also known to engage in 'headhunting', a ritual of war in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus proving his bravery."<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

In <i><a>A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa</a></i> (1892) <a>Robert Louis Stevenson</a>, details the activities of the <a>great powers</a> battling for influence in Samoa – the United States, Germany and Britain – and the political machinations of the various Samoan factions within their indigenous political system.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Even as they descended into ever greater interclan warfare, what most alarmed Stevenson was the Samoans' economic innocence. In 1894 just months before his death, he addressed the island chiefs:
</p>
<p>
 He had "seen these judgments of God," in Hawaii where abandoned native churches stood like tombstones "over a grave, in the midst of the white men’s sugar fields".<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>

<p>
The Germans, in particular, began to show great commercial interest in the Samoan Islands, especially on the island of Upolu, where German firms monopolised <a>copra</a> and <a>cocoa bean</a> processing. The United States laid its own claim, based on commercial shipping interests in Pearl River in <a>Hawaii</a> and Pago Pago Bay in <a>Eastern Samoa</a>, and forced alliances, most conspicuously on the islands of <a>Tutuila</a> and <a>Manu'a</a> which became <a>American Samoa</a>.

</p>
<p>
Britain also sent troops to protect British business enterprise, harbour rights, and consulate office. This was followed by an <a>eight-year civil war</a>, during which each of the three powers supplied arms, training and in some cases combat troops to the warring Samoan parties. The <a>Samoan crisis</a> came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into Apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent. A massive storm on 15 March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Second Samoan Civil War</a> reached a head in 1898 when <a>Germany</a>, the <a>United Kingdom</a>, and the United States were locked in dispute over who should control the <a>Samoan Islands</a>. The <a>Siege of Apia</a> occurred in March 1899. Samoan forces loyal to Prince <a>Tanu</a> were besieged by a larger force of Samoan rebels loyal to <a>Mata'afa Iosefo</a>. Supporting Prince Tanu were landing parties from four British and American warships. After several days of fighting, the Samoan rebels were finally defeated.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>
American and British warships shelled Apia on 15 March 1899, including the <a>USS <i>Philadelphia</i></a>. Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States quickly resolved to end the hostilities and divided the island chain at the <a>Tripartite Convention of 1899</a>, signed at Washington on 2 December 1899 with ratifications exchanged on 16 February 1900.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The eastern island-group became a territory of the United States (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1904) and was known as <a>American Samoa</a>. The western islands, by far the greater landmass, became <a>German Samoa</a>. The United Kingdom had vacated all claims in Samoa and in return received (1) termination of German rights in <a>Tonga</a>, (2) all of the Solomon Islands south of Bougainville, and (3) territorial alignments in West Africa.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>
The German Empire governed the western part of the Samoan archipelago from 1900 to 1914. <a>Wilhelm Solf</a> was appointed the colony's first governor. In 1908, when the non-violent <a>Mau a Pule</a> resistance movement arose, Solf did not hesitate to banish the Mau leader <a>Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe</a> to Saipan in the German <a>Northern Mariana Islands</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The German colonial administration governed on the principle that "there was only one government in the islands."<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> Thus, there was no Samoan <i>Tupu</i> (king), nor an <i>alii sili</i> (similar to a governor), but two <i>Fautua</i> (advisors) were appointed by the colonial government. <i>Tumua</i> and <i>Pule</i> (traditional governments of Upolu and Savai'i) were for a time silent; all decisions on matters affecting lands and titles were under the control of the colonial Governor.

</p>
<p>
In the first month of <a>World War I</a>, on 29 August 1914, troops of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force landed unopposed on Upolu and <a>seized control</a> from the German authorities, following a request by Great Britain for <a>New Zealand</a> to perform this "great and urgent imperial service."<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Samoa_Trust_Territory">Western Samoa Trust Territory</a></div>
<p>
From the end of <a>World War I</a> until 1962, New Zealand controlled Western Samoa as a <a>Class C Mandate</a> under <a>trusteeship</a> through the <a>League of Nations</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> then through the United Nations. Between 1919 and 1962, Samoa was administered by the <a>Department of External Affairs</a>, a government department which had been specially created to oversee New Zealand's Island Territories and Samoa.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> In 1943, this department was renamed the <a>Department of Island Territories</a> after a separate <a>Department of External Affairs</a> was created to conduct New Zealand's foreign affairs.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> During the period of New Zealand control, their administrators were responsible for two major incidents.

</p>
<p>
In the first incident, approximately one fifth of the Samoan population died in the <a>influenza epidemic of 1918–1919</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1918, during the final stages of <a>World War I</a>, the <a>Spanish flu</a> had taken its toll, spreading rapidly from country to country. On Samoa, there had been no epidemic of pneumonic influenza in Western Samoa before the arrival of the <a>SS <i>Talune</i></a> from <a>Auckland</a> on 7 November 1918. The NZ administration allowed the ship to berth in breach of quarantine; within seven days of this ship's arrival, influenza became epidemic in Upolu and then spread rapidly throughout the rest of the territory.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> Samoa suffered the most of all Pacific islands, with 90% of the population infected; 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. The cause of the epidemic was confirmed in 1919 by a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Epidemic<sup>[<i><a><span>clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>concluded that there had been no epidemic of pneumonic influenza in Western Samoa before the arrival of the <i>Talune</i> from Auckland on 7 November 1918.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The second major incident arose out of an initially peaceful protest by the <a>Mau</a> (which literally translates as "strongly held opinion"), a non-violent popular movement which had its beginnings in the early 1900s on Savai'i, led by <a>Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe</a>, an orator chief deposed by Solf. In 1909, Lauaki was exiled to <a>Saipan</a> and died en route back to Samoa in 1915.

</p>
<p>
By 1918, Western Samoa had a population of some 38,000 Samoans and 1,500 Europeans.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, native Samoans greatly resented New Zealand's colonial rule, and blamed inflation and the catastrophic 1918 flu epidemic on its misrule.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> By the late 1920s the resistance movement against colonial rule had gathered widespread support. One of the Mau leaders was <a>Olaf Frederick Nelson</a>, a half Samoan and half Swedish merchant.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Nelson was eventually <a>exiled</a> during the late 1920s and early 1930s, but he continued to assist the organisation financially and politically. In accordance with the Mau's non-violent philosophy, the newly elected leader, High Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi, led his fellow uniformed Mau in a peaceful demonstration in downtown Apia on 28 December 1929.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The New Zealand police attempted to arrest one of the leaders in the demonstration. When he resisted, a struggle developed between the police and the Mau. The officers began to fire randomly into the crowd and a <a>Lewis machine gun</a>, mounted in preparation for this demonstration, was used to disperse the demonstrators.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> Mau leader and paramount chief <a>Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III</a> was shot from behind and killed while trying to bring calm and order to the Mau demonstrators. Ten others died that day and approximately 50 were injured by gunshot wounds and police batons.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> That day would come to be known in Samoa as Black Saturday. The Mau grew, remaining steadfastly non-violent, and expanded to include the highly influential women's branch.

</p>
<p>
After repeated efforts by the Samoan independence movement, the New Zealand <a>Western Samoa Act 1961</a> of 24 November 1961 granted Samoa independence, effective on 1 January 1962, upon which the Trusteeship Agreement terminated.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Samoa also signed a friendship treaty with New Zealand. Samoa, the first small-island country in the Pacific to become independent, joined the <a>Commonwealth of Nations</a> on 28 August 1970. While independence was achieved at the beginning of January, Samoa annually celebrates 1 June as its independence day.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Travel writer <a>Paul Theroux</a> noted marked differences between the societies in Western Samoa and <a>American Samoa</a> in 1992.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2002, New Zealand's prime minister <a>Helen Clark</a> formally apologised for New Zealand's role in Spanish Influenza outbreak in 1918 that killed over a quarter of Samoa's population and for the Black Saturday killings in 1929.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="1997_name%20change">1997 name change</h3>
<p>
On 4 July 1997 the government amended the constitution to change the country's name from <i>Western Samoa</i> to <i>Samoa</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> However, in the United Nations, the country's name had always been <i>Samoa</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup><a>American Samoa</a>  protested against the move, asserting that the change diminished its own identity.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="21st_century">21st century</h3>
<p>
On 7 September 2009, the government changed the <a>rule of the road</a>, from right to left, in common with most other Commonwealth countries, most notably countries in the region such as <a>Australia</a> and <a>New Zealand</a>, home to large numbers of Samoans.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> This made Samoa the first country in the 21st century to switch to driving on the left.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the end of December 2011, Samoa changed its time zone offset from UTC−11 to UTC+13, effectively jumping forward by one day, omitting Friday, 30 December from the local calendar. This also had the effect of changing the shape of the <a>International Date Line</a>, moving it to the east of the territory.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> This change aimed to help the nation boost its economy in doing business with <a>Australia</a> and <a>New Zealand</a>. Before this change, Samoa was 21 hours behind <a>Sydney</a>, but the change means it is now three hours ahead. The previous time zone, implemented on 4 July 1892, operated in line with American traders based in <a>California</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> In October 2021, Samoa ceased the <a>daylight saving time</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2017, Samoa signed the UN <a>treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In June 2017, Parliament established an amendment to Article 1 of the Samoan Constitution, thereby making <a>Christianity</a> the state religion.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In May 2021, Fiame <a>Naomi Mataʻafa</a> became Samoa's first female prime minister. Mataʻafa's <a>FAST</a> party narrowly won the <a>election</a>, ending the rule of long-term Prime Minister <a>Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> although the <a>constitutional crisis</a> complicated and delayed this. On 24 May 2021, she was sworn in as the new prime minister, though it was not until July that the Supreme Court ruled that her swearing-in was legal, thus ending the constitutional crisis and bringing an end to Tuilaʻepa's 22-year premiership.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>1960 constitution</a>, which formally came into force with independence from New Zealand in 1962, builds on the British pattern of <a>parliamentary democracy</a>, modified to take account of Samoan customs.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> The national modern Government of Samoa is referred to as the <i>Malo</i>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Fiame Mata'afa Faumuina Mulinu'u II</a>, one of the four highest-ranking <a>paramount chiefs</a> in the country, became Samoa's first <a>Prime Minister</a>. Two other paramount chiefs at the time of independence were appointed joint <a>heads of state</a> for life. <a>Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole</a> died in 1963, leaving <a>Malietoa Tanumafili II</a> sole head of state until his death on 11 May 2007. The next Head of State was <a>Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi</a>, was elected by the legislature on 17 June 2007 for a fixed five-year term,<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> and was re-elected unopposed in July 2012. He was succeeded by <a>Tuimalealiifano Va'aletoa Sualauvi II</a> in 2017.

</p>
<p>
The unicameral legislature (the <a>Fono</a>) consists of 51 members serving 5-year terms. Forty-nine are <i><a>matai</a></i> title-holders elected from territorial districts by Samoans; the other two are chosen by non-Samoans with no chiefly affiliation on separate electoral rolls. At least, 10% of the MPs are women.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> Universal suffrage was adopted in 1990, but only chiefs (matai) may stand for election to the Samoan seats. There are more than 25,000 matais in the country, about 5% of whom are women.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> The prime minister, chosen by a majority in the Fono, is appointed by the head of state to form a government. The prime minister's choices for the 12 <a>cabinet positions</a> are appointed by the head of state, subject to the continuing confidence of the Fono.

</p>
<p>
Prominent women in Samoan politics include the late <a>Laulu Fetauimalemau Mata'afa</a> (1928–2007) from <a>Lotofaga</a> constituency, the wife of Samoa's first prime minister. Their daughter <a>Fiame Naomi Mataʻafa</a> is a high chief and a long-serving senior member of cabinet, who was elected Prime Minister in 2021. Other women in politics include Samoan scholar and eminent professor <a>Aiono Fanaafi Le Tagaloa</a>, orator-chief <a>Matatumua Maimoana</a> and <a>Safuneitu'uga Pa'aga Neri</a> (as of 2016<sup><a>[update]</a></sup> the Minister of Communication and Technology).

</p>
<p>
The judicial system incorporates <a>English common law</a> and local customs. The <a>Supreme Court of Samoa</a> is the court of highest jurisdiction. The <a>Chief Justice of Samoa</a> is appointed by the head of state upon the recommendation of the prime minister.

Samoa comprises eleven <i>itūmālō</i> (political districts). These are the traditional eleven districts which predate European arrival. Each district has its own constitutional foundation (<i>fa'avae</i>) based on the traditional order of title precedence found in each district's <i>faalupega</i> (traditional salutations).<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The capital village of each district administers and coordinates the affairs of the district and confers each district's paramount title, amongst other responsibilities.

</p>
<p>
For example:

</p>
<p>
<a>A'ana</a> has its capital at <a>Leulumoega</a>. The paramount <i>'tama-a-'aiga'</i> (royal lineage) title of A'ana is <a>Tuimalealiifano</a>. The paramount <i>pāpā</i> title of A'ana is the <a>Tui A'ana</a>. The orator group which confers this title – the <i>Faleiva</i> (House of Nine) – is based at Leulumoega.

</p>
<p>
<a>Ātua</a> has its capital at <a>Lufilufi</a>. The paramount <i>'tama-a-'aiga'</i> (royal lineage) titles of A'ana are Tupua Tamasese (based in <a>Falefa</a> and Salani) and Mata'afa (based in Amaile and Lotofaga). The two main political families who confer the respective titles are <a>'Aiga Sā Fenunuivao</a> and '<a>Aiga Sā Levālasi.</a> The paramount <i>pāpā</i> title of Ātua is the <a>Tui Ātua</a>. The orator group which confers this title - the <i>Faleono</i> (House of Six) - is based at Lufilufi.

</p>
<p>
<a>Tuamasaga</a> has its capital at <a>Afega</a>. The paramount <i>'tama-a-'aiga'</i> (royal lineage) title of Tuamasaga is the <a>Malietoa</a> title, based in <a>Malie</a>. The main political family that confers the Malietoa title is 'Aiga Sā Malietoa, with Auimatagi as the main speaker for the family. The paramount <i>pāpā</i> titles of Tuamasaga are Gatoaitele (conferred by Afega) and Vaetamasoalii (conferred by Safata).<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>

Samoa lies south of the equator, about halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, in the <a>Polynesian</a> region of the Pacific Ocean. The total land area is 2,842 km<sup>2</sup> (1,097 sq mi),<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> consisting of the two large islands of <a>Upolu</a> and <a>Savai'i</a> (which together account for 99% of the total land area) and eight small islets.

</p>
<p>
The islets are:<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

<p>
The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters of Samoa's population, and to the capital city, <a>Apia</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Samoan islands result geologically from <a>volcanism</a>, originating with the <a>Samoa hotspot</a>, which probably results from a <a>mantle plume</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> While all of the islands have volcanic origins, only Savai'i, the westernmost island in Samoa, remains volcanically active, with the most recent eruptions at <a>Mt Matavanu</a> (1905–1911), <a>Mata o le Afi</a> (1902) and <a>Mauga Afi</a> (1725). The highest point in Samoa is <a>Mt Silisili</a>, at 1,858 m (6,096 ft). The <a>Saleaula</a> lava fields situated on the central north coast of Savai'i result from the Mt Matavanu eruptions, which left 50 km<sup>2</sup> (19 sq mi) of solidified lava.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Savai'i is the largest of the Samoan islands and the sixth-largest Polynesian island (after New Zealand's <a>North</a>, <a>South</a> and <a>Stewart Islands</a> and the Hawaiian islands of <a>Hawaiʻi</a> and <a>Maui</a>). The population of Savai'i is 42,000 people.

The <a>United Nations</a> has classified Samoa as an <a>economically developing country</a> since 2014.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> As of 2017<sup><a>[update]</a></sup> Samoa's gross domestic product in <a>purchasing-power parity</a> was estimated at $1.13 billion <a>U.S. dollars</a>, ranking the country 204th in the world. The <a>services sector</a> accounted for 66% of GDP, followed by <a>industry</a> and <a>agriculture</a> at 23.6% and 10.4% respectively.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> For the same year, the Samoan <a>labour force</a> was estimated at 50,700.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Central Bank of Samoa</a> issues and regulates Samoa's currency, the <a>Samoan tālā</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>
The economy of Samoa has traditionally depended on agriculture and fishing at the local level. In modern times, <a>development aid</a>, private family <a>remittances from overseas</a>, and agricultural exports have become key factors in the nation's economy. Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labour force and furnishes 90% of exports, featuring <a>coconut</a> cream, <a>coconut oil</a>, <a>noni</a> (juice of the <i>nonu</i> fruit, as it is known in Samoan), and <a>copra</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Sixty percent of Samoa's electricity comes from renewable <a>hydro</a>, solar, and wind sources, with the remainder produced by diesel generators. The Electric Power Corporation set a goal of <a>100% renewable energy</a> by 2021.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Agriculture">Agriculture</h2>
<p>
In the period before German colonisation (from the late 19th century), Samoa produced mostly copra. German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large-scale <a>plantation</a> operations and in developing new industries, notably cocoa beans and rubber, relying on imported labourers from <a>China</a> and <a>Melanesia</a>. When the value of <a>natural rubber</a> fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (<a>World War I</a>) in 1918, the <a>New Zealand</a> government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in <a>New Zealand</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Because of variations in altitude, Samoa can cultivate a large range of tropical and subtropical crops. Land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934 km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC).<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), <a>cocoa beans</a> (for chocolate), rubber, and bananas.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> The annual production of both bananas and copra has been<sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup> in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the <a>Asiatic rhinoceros beetle</a> in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and are used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are <a>Criollo</a>-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WESTEC is the biggest coffee producer.

</p>
<p>
Other agricultural industries have proven less successful. <a>Sugarcane</a> production, was originally established by Germans in the early 20th century. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of <a>Apia</a>. <a>Pineapples</a> grow well in Samoa, but have not moved beyond local consumption to become a major export.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>fa'a Samoa</a>, or traditional Samoan way, remains a strong force in Samoan life and politics. As one of the oldest Polynesian cultures, the fa'asamoa developed over a period of 3,000 years, withstanding centuries of European influence to maintain its historical customs, social and political systems, and <a>language</a>. Cultural customs such as the <a>Samoa 'ava ceremony</a> are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of <i><a>matai</a></i> chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven <i><a>'ie toga</a></i>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Samoan mythology</a> includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as <a>Tagaloa</a> and the goddess of war <a>Nafanua</a>, the daughter of <a>Saveasi'uleo</a>, ruler of the spirit realm <a>Pulotu</a>. Other legends include the well known story of <a>Sina and the Eel</a> which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.

</p>
<p>
Some Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side by side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of vāfealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or <a>fa'aaloalo</a>. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Some Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan <i><a>fale</a></i> (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.

</p>
<p>
The Samoan <i><a>siva</a></i> dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> The <i><a>sasa</a></i> is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid <a>synchronised</a> movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums <i>(<a>pate</a>)</i> or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the <i><a>fa'ataupati</a></i> or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>

As with other Polynesian cultures (<a>Hawaiian</a>, <a>Tahitian</a> and <a>Māori</a>) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos. For males, it is called the <a>Pe'a</a> and consists of intricate and geometrical patterns <a>tattooed</a> that cover areas from the knees up towards the ribs. A male who possesses such a tatau is called a <a>soga'imiti</a>. A Samoan girl or <i>teine</i> is given a <a>malu</a>, which covers the area from just below her knees to her upper thighs.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>

According to Katerina Martina Teaiwa, PhD from the University of Hawaii at Manoa, "Hip hop culture in particular is popular amongst Samoan youth."<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup> As in many other countries, hip hop music is popular. In addition, the integration of hip hop elements into Samoan tradition also "testifies to the transferability of the dance forms themselves," and to the "circuits through which people and all their embodied knowledge travel."<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> Dance both in its traditional form and its more modern forms has remained a central cultural currency to Samoans, especially youths.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup>

<p>
The main sports played in Samoa are <a>rugby union</a>, <a>Samoan cricket</a> and <a>netball</a>. Rugby union is the national football code<sup>[<i><a><span>clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> of Samoa. In Samoan villages, volleyball is also popular.

</p>
<p>
Rugby union is the national sport in Samoa and the <a>national team</a>, nicknamed the Manu Samoa, is consistently competitive against teams from vastly more populous nations. Samoa has competed at every <a>Rugby World Cup</a> since <a>1991</a>, and made the quarter finals in 1991, <a>1995</a> and the second round of the <a>1999</a> World Cup.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> At the 2003 world cup, Manu Samoa came close to beating eventual world champions, England. Samoa also played in the <a>Pacific Nations Cup</a> and the <a>Pacific Tri-Nations</a>. The sport is governed by the <a>Samoa Rugby Football Union</a>, who are members of the <a>Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance</a>, and thus, also contribute to the international <a>Pacific Islanders rugby union team</a>.

</p>
<p>
At club level, there is the <a>National Provincial Championship</a> and <a>Pacific Rugby Cup</a>. They also took home the cup at Wellington and the Hong Kong Rugby Sevens in 2007—for which the Prime Minister of Samoa, also Chairman of the national rugby union, Tuila’epa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi, declared a national holiday. They were also the <a>IRB World Sevens Series</a> Champions in 2010 capping a year of achievement for the Samoans, following wins in the US, Australia, Hong Kong and Scotland Sevens tournaments.

</p>
<p>
Prominent Samoan players include <a>Pat Lam</a> and <a>Brian Lima</a>. In addition, many Samoans have played for or are playing for <a>New Zealand</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Rugby league</a> is mostly played by Samoans living in New Zealand and Australia.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup><a>Samoa</a>  reached the quarter finals of the <a>2013 Rugby League World Cup</a>, the team comprising players from the <a>NRL</a> and <a>Super League</a> plus domestic players. Many Samoans and New Zealanders or Australians of Samoan descent play in the Super League and National Leagues in Britain, including Francis Meli, Ta'ane Lavulavu of Workington Town, Maurie Fa'asavalu of St Helens, David Fatialofa of Whitehaven and Setaimata Sa, who signed with London Irish rugby club. Other noteworthy players from NZ and Australia have represented the <a>Samoan National team</a>. The 2011 domestic Samoan rugby league competition contained 10 teams with plans to expand to 12 in 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Samoans have been very visible in <a>boxing</a>, <a>kickboxing</a>, <a>wrestling</a>, and <a>sumo</a>; some Samoan sumo wrestlers, most famously <a>Musashimaru</a> and <a>Konishiki</a>, have reached the highest rank of <i><a>Ozeki</a></i> and <i><a>yokozuna</a></i>.

</p>
<p>
<a>American football</a> is occasionally played in Samoa, reflecting its wide popularity in <a>American Samoa</a>, where the sport is played under high school sanction. About 30 ethnic Samoans, many from American Samoa, currently play in the <a>National Football League</a>. A 2002 article from <i><a>ESPN</a></i> estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan or a Samoan living in the mainland United States) is 40 times more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup>
