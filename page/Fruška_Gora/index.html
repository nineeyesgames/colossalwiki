  <h1 id="Fru%C5%A1ka_Gora">Fruška Gora</h1>
<p>
<b>Fruška gora</b> (<a>Serbian Cyrillic</a>: <span>Фрушка гора</span>) is a <a>mountain</a> in <a>northern Serbia</a>. Most of the area is <a>administratively</a> part of <a>Serbia</a>, but a small part on its western side extends into eastern <a>Croatia</a>. The area under Serbian administration forms the country's oldest <a>national park</a>. Sometimes it's also referred to as the <i>Jewel of Serbia</i>, due to its largely pristine landscape and protection effort, or the <i>Serbian Mount Athos</i>, it being the home of a large number of historical <a>Serbian Orthodox</a> monasteries.

<h2 id="Name">Name</h2>
<p>
In <a>Serbian</a>, it is known as <i>Fruška gora</i> (<small>pronounced </small><span><a>[frûʃkaː ɡǒra]</a></span>, Фрушка гора), in <a>Hungarian</a> as <i>Tarcal</i> (also <i>Almus-hegy</i> or <i>Árpatarló</i>), in <a>German</a> as <i>Frankenwald</i>, and in <a>Latin</a> as <i>Alma Mons</i>. In Medieval Greek, it was known as <i>Frangochoria</i>.

</p>
<p>
The mountain's name originates in the old <a>Serbian</a> word <i>"Fruzi"</i> of which singular form is <i>"Frug"</i>; and its adjective is <i>Fruški</i>, which was used for naming the <a>Frankish people</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The name of <i>"Fruška Gora"</i> is <i>"Frankish mountain"</i> in <a>English</a> whose meaning is based on describing a historical event, viz, the mountain served as a natural border when Frankish campaigns were set up in the area. In the time of the <a>Roman Empire</a>, its name was <i>Alma Mons</i>, meaning the "fertile mount". It is recorded that during the reign of the emperor <a>Marcus Aurelius Probus</a>, 276-282, who was born in the nearby <a>Sirmium</a>, the first <a>grapevines</a> on the mountain were planted.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
The mountain is a natural geological phenomenon as it is built from the rocks from almost all geological periods.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> It used to be an island during the existence of the <a>Pannonian Sea</a>. To the north, the mountain is bordered by the <a>Danube</a> river, while to the south it descends into the Syrmian lowlands. Lengthwise, it is approximately 80 km (50 mi) from east to west and is 15 km (9.3 mi) from north to south. Its highest peak is Crveni Čot at 539 m (1,768 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Vineyards">Vineyards</h2>
<p>
Fruška Gora also divides Syrmia in two geographically distinct parts: Wine Syrmia (upper or mountainous) and Swine Syrmia (lower or lowland). Slopes of the mountain were established as one of the most prestigious vineyards in Hungary, ever since the 15th century. Golden age of the Fruška Gora's <a>viticulture</a> began after 1699 and the <a>Treaty of Karlowitz</a>, when Ottomans were expelled from the area, until the late 19th century.

</p>
<p>
In Sremski Karlovci, a famous <a>dessert wine</a> called <a>bermet</a> is produced, with protected <a>geographical indication</a>. It is recorded that the crates of bermet were used as the bribe, used by the Serbs to obtain certain privileges from the Austrian empress <a>Maria Theresa</a>. The wine was served at the Russian and British courts, and was on the <a>wine list</a> of <i><a>Titanic</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The slopes of Fruška Gora are perfectly suited for <a>grape</a> arbors, and <a>wine</a>-makers producing <a>Traminer</a>, <a>Riesling</a> and other wines in the region. After the fall of communism, the <a>Serbian Orthodox Church</a> got 10,000 hectares restitution in the area of their nationalized properties.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="National_park">National park</h2>
<p>
A <a>national park</a> Fruška Gora was declared in 1960 and covers an area of 266.72 km<sup>2</sup> (102.98 sq mi). It is the oldest modern national park in Serbia.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Plant_life">Plant life</h3>
<p>
Rich fossil fauna is preserved and almost 90% of the park area is forested. The predominant tree species include <a>linden</a>, <a>oak</a> and <a>beech</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The concentration of linden forests is highest in Europe. In time, linden became the dominant tree species, replacing formerly much larger and dominant oak forests, which are considered to be the autochthonous vegetation on Fruška Gora.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> Altogether, 1,500 plant species inhabits the park, of which 200 are protected.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> There are also 400 species of fungi. Pannonian plant <a>endemites</a> include Tatar dock (<i>Crambe tataria</i>), <a>broadleaf wild leek</a> and <a>Hungarian leopard's-bane</a>. There are some 30 species of <a>orchids</a> in the park.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2016, massive cutting of trees in the park occurred, one of the largest in the mountain's recorded history. Over 10 ha (25 acres) of forest have been cut. Park administration then stated that an autochthonous species of oak will be planted instead. However, they never planted anything and in the future years a <a>thicket</a> of the remaining <a>black locust</a> high shrubs grew instead. The administration, nevertheless, claims that the oaks have been planted. In the spring of 2019, aggressive cutting continued. Apparently indiscriminate cutting, without proper notifications what is being cut and by whom, destroyed <a>hiking paths</a> and orienteering marks. Also, the cutting sections of the forest weren't properly secured and some were completely wrong: beech trees have been cut even though the table stated that oak trees are being cut. According to the environmentalists, regular visitors and recreational athletes, the cutting was never so massive.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Timber was transported outside of the park and was sold by the park administration. They responded that everything is being part of the planned action, that park has to think about the "economic part" of its existence (as the government is allocating small amounts of money to the park) and that trees will be "replenished later" because the cut ones were old. Members of the commission which participated in the planning said that even more trees should have been cut as 80% of the forest is over 80 years old. Only 3% of park's territory is under the strict protection (some 800 ha (2,000 acres) of forest at Papratski Dol locality). The trees have been cut right along the border of this area, clearing the land which surrounds it. Citizens responded that national park is not a <a>tree farm</a> where the trees should be "replaced" and that protected forests can't be perceived as a <a>feedstock</a>. Director of the park said that he doesn't know how much trees they cut and planted, but numbers officially published by the park in 2018 show that in an undefined period they planted 50,000 seedlings, but 100,000 trees have been cut. Also, the park's plan for 2019 envisioned almost 100 time more money for cutting the trees than for the planting of the new ones.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By the 2010s, the predominant cultivated plant on the foothills of the mountain and the surrounding vast fields, became the <a>rapeseed</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> In March 2020 it was announced that <a>saffron</a> was discovered on the mountain. There are some 20 species of saffron living in Serbia, but they never populated Fruška Gora. The discovered species is <a>woodland crocus</a>, it was found on only one location, but already spread to several thousand individual plants.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2020 60,000 new trees will be planted in the park.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Animal_life">Animal life</h3>
<p>
Protected insect species include <a>Balkan goldenring</a>, certain species of <a>dragonflies</a> and <a>hoverflies</a>, and Hungarian <a>ground beetle</a>, which already went extinct in some other European countries.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> Park is also the habitat of 13 amphibian species and 11 reptilians, of which 14 are protected, among them <a>fire salamander</a> and <a>European adder</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Park is home to 211 bird species. Symbol of Fruška Gora is <a>eastern imperial eagle</a>, today with only 2 or 3 remaining breeding couples. There are 60 mammalian species, of which 17 are protected, including <a>edible dormouse</a>, <a>European pine marten</a>, <a>European polecat</a> and <a>Mediterranean water shrew</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> Out of 30 species of <a>bats</a> which live in Serbia, 15 inhabits the mountain and all are under strict protection.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> In January 2018, for the first time after the 1960s, additional <a>mouflons</a> were introduced in the park. 30 animals were relocated from <a>Slovakia</a>, which raised the number of mouflons in the park to 70.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>
There are traces of human habitation in this area that date from <a>neolithic</a> times. Before the <a>Roman</a> conquest, <a>Illyrians</a> and <a>Celts</a><sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> inhabited this region. In 31 AD, this area was conquered by the Romans and was included into <a>Pannonia</a> province. The <a>Danube</a> river was a border of the Roman Empire (<a>limes</a>), and on the northern side of the mountain several Roman border fortresses were built.

</p>
<p>
In the <a>Early Middle Ages</a>, this area was settled by <a>Quadi</a>, <a>Huns</a>, <a>Goths</a>, <a>Gepids</a>, <a>Slavs</a> and <a>Avars</a>. The Franks expelled Huns, Avars, Gepids and <a>Lombards</a> from this area and formed the southern border of the Frankish Empire, ultimately giving its name to the mountain.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
It was later inhabited by <a>Bulgarians</a>, <a>Pechenegs</a> and <a>Hungarians</a>. In the 11th century, when <a>Christianity</a> was split between <a>Catholicism</a> and <a>Orthodoxy</a>, both communities had their churches in this region. A very important group of <a>Serb</a> medieval monasteries was formed on the mountain.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d6/Fru%C5%A1ka_gora_-_spomenik_na_Iri%C5%A1kom_vencu%2C_WWII_memorial_04.jpg/250px-Fru%C5%A1ka_gora_-_spomenik_na_Iri%C5%A1kom_vencu%2C_WWII_memorial_04.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Since the 19th century, during the Austro-Hungarian period, cities developed so as the trade and crafts. Settlements on the mountain itself developed, designed in the typical folk tradition. Two most distinct settlements, in terms of architectural inheritance, are <a>Sremski Karlovci</a>, which grew into the center of the political and cultural life of the Serbs in Austria and, later, Austria-Hungary, and <a>Irig</a>, one of the most developed Syrmian settlements since the 18th century.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
During the time, the area was part of the <a>Hun Empire</a>, the <a>Ostrogothic Kingdom</a>, the <a>Gepid Kingdom</a>, the <a>Lombard state</a>, the <a>Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a>Avar Khaganate</a>, the <a>Frankish Empire</a>, the <a>Bulgarian Empire</a>, <a>Lower Pannonia</a>, the <a>Kingdom of Hungary</a>, the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>, the <a>Habsburg Monarchy</a>, the <a>Austrian Empire</a>, <a>Austria-Hungary</a>, the <a>State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs</a>, the <a>Kingdom of Serbia</a>, the <a>Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes</a>, the <a>Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a>, <a>Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a>, <a>Serbia and Montenegro</a>, and now is within the <a>Republic of Serbia</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
During <a>World War II</a>, this area was occupied by the <a>Axis Powers</a>, and Fruška Gora was an important center of <a>Partisan</a> resistance movement. A liberated partisan territory was formed in this region.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
On 28 March 2003, police revealed that former Serbian president <a>Ivan Stambolić</a> had been assassinated by eight men on the mountain. At the time <a>Slobodan Milošević</a> was still in power. It was later determined that Milošević had given the order for Stambolić's murder.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
Edreš Hill was used as the quarry by the prehistoric people for their tools. There are numerous Roman remains, like the fortress <a>Acumincum</a> near <a>Slankamen</a> and <a>Bassianae</a>, Roman town near <a>Donji Petrovci</a>. The town was fortified with the ramparts and square towers. Within the walls, the objects with the heating and sewage systems were discovered, so as the walls painted with <a>frescoes</a> and floor mosaics. In 1952, at the locality of Bikić Do, a Roman vault was discovered with 11,500 coins, including ones from the reign of <a>Constantine the Great</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Attractions from the later period include the <a>Tower of Vrdnik</a>, the only remaining part of the medieval fortress, the <a>Rivica Watermill</a> and <a>Stražilovo</a>, where the remains of the poet <a>Branko Radičević</a> were reinterred from <a>Vienna</a> in 1883.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>

<p>
In 1991, the population of the Fruška Gora region numbered at 114,263 people. Settlements in the area include 23 villages, as well as several towns, which are located around the mountain. These towns are: <a>Šid</a>, <a>Beočin</a>, <a>Petrovaradin</a>, <a>Sremska Kamenica</a>, <a>Sremski Karlovci</a> and <a>Irig</a>.

There are over a dozen <a>Serbian Orthodox</a> monasteries located on Fruška Gora. In the eighteenth century the monasteries became the home of monks from <a>Rača monastery</a> in the Bajina Bašta municipality by the Drina River. These monks were writers famous for their illuminated manuscripts.

</p>
<p>
Fruška Gora Monasteries were declared <a>Monuments of Culture of Exceptional Importance</a> in 1990, and are protected by the state.

</p>
<p>
<a>Ottoman</a> documents mention 35 monasteries, of which 16 survived and are still active today. Due to the such large number of monasteries on one place, Fruška Gora is colloquially called Serbian <a>Mount Athos</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The <a>Holy Synod</a> of the Serbian Orthodox Church officially declared Fruška Gora the Holy Mountain on 12 October 2003.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
