It is located between <a>Syria</a> to <a>the north and east</a> and <a>Israel</a> to <a>the south</a>, while <a>Cyprus</a> lies to its west across the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>; its location at the crossroads of the <a>Mediterranean Basin</a> and the <a>Arabian</a> hinterland has contributed to <a>its rich history</a> and shaped <a>a cultural identity</a> of <a>religious diversity</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> Lebanon is home to roughly six million people and covers an area of 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi), making it one of the <a>smallest countries in the world</a>. The official language of the state is <a>Arabic</a>, while <a>French</a> is also formally recognized; the <a>Lebanese dialect of Arabic</a> is used alongside <a>Modern Standard Arabic</a> throughout the country.

</p>
<p>
The earliest evidence of civilization in Lebanon dates back over 7000 years, predating <a>recorded history</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Modern-day Lebanon was home to the <a>Phoenicians</a>, a maritime culture that flourished for almost 3000 years (<abbr>c.</abbr><span> 3200–539 BCE</span>). In 64 BCE, the <a>Roman Empire</a> conquered the region, and it eventually became among the empire's leading centers of <a>Christianity</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> The <a>Mount Lebanon</a> range saw the emergence of a monastic tradition known as the <a>Maronite Church</a>. Upon the <a>region's conquest</a> by the <a>early Arab Muslims</a>, the <a>Maronites</a> held onto their religion and identity. However, a new religious group known as the <a>Druze</a> eventually established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries. During the <a>Crusades</a>, the Maronites re-established contact with the <a>Roman Catholic Church</a> and asserted their communion with <a>Rome</a>. 

</p>
<p>
Lebanon was conquered by the <a>Ottoman Empire</a> in the 16th century and remained under its rule for the next 400 years. Following the empire's collapse after <a>World War I</a>, the five Ottoman provinces constituting modern-day Lebanon came under the <a>French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon</a>, under which its French-ruled predecessor state of <a>Greater Lebanon</a> was established. Following the <a>invasion and occupation</a> of the <a>French Third Republic</a> by <a>Nazi Germany</a> during <a>World War II</a>, French rule over the region weakened. Upon gaining its independence from <a>Free France</a> in 1943, Lebanon established a unique <a>confessionalist</a> form of government, with the state's major <a>religious sects</a> being <a>apportioned specific political powers</a>. Lebanon initially was relatively stable. <sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> This stability was short-lived and was ultimately shattered by the outbreak of large-scale fighting in the <a>Lebanese Civil War</a> (1975–1990) between various political and sectarian factions. During this period, Lebanon was also subjected to overlapping foreign military occupations by <a>Syria from 1976 to 2005</a> and by <a>Israel from 1985 to 2000</a>. Since the end of the war, there have been extensive efforts to revive the economy and rebuild national infrastructure.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Lebanon is a <a>developing country</a>, ranking 92nd on the <a>Human Development Index</a> and among the highest in the <a>Arab world</a> outside of the <a>oil-rich economies of the Persian Gulf</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> Its has been classified as an <a>upper middle income</a> state.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> However, the <a>Lebanese liquidity crisis</a>, <a>corruption</a> as well as recent events have precipitated the collapse of currency, political instability, widespread shortages, high <a>unemployment</a> and <a>poverty</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> Despite the country's small size,<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><a>Lebanese culture</a>  is renowned both in the <a>Middle East</a> and globally, primarily powered by <a>its extensive diaspora</a>.

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
The name of <a>Mount Lebanon</a> originates from the <a>Phoenician</a><a>root</a><i><i>lbn</i></i>   (<a>𐤋𐤁𐤍</a>) meaning "white", apparently from its snow-capped peaks.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Occurrences of the name have been found in different <a>Middle Bronze Age</a> texts from the library of <a>Ebla</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> and three of the twelve tablets of the <a>Epic of Gilgamesh</a>.
The name is recorded in <a>Ancient Egyptian</a> as <i>Rmnn</i> (𓂋𓏠𓈖𓈖𓈉), where <i>R</i> stood for <a>Canaanite</a><i>L</i> .<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
The name occurs nearly 70 times in the <a>Hebrew Bible</a>, as <span>לְבָנוֹן</span>.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<i>Lebanon</i> as the name of an administrative unit (as opposed to the mountain range) that was introduced with the <a>Ottoman reforms</a> of 1861, as the <i><a>Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate</a></i> (<a>Arabic</a>: <span>متصرفية جبل لبنان</span>‎; <a>Turkish</a>: <i>Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı</i>), continued in the name of the <i><a>State of Greater Lebanon</a></i> (<a>Arabic</a>: <span>دولة لبنان الكبير</span>‎ <i><i>Dawlat Lubnān al-Kabīr</i></i>; <a>French</a>: <i>État du Grand Liban</i>) in 1920, and eventually in the name of the sovereign <i>Republic of Lebanon</i> (<a>Arabic</a>: <span>الجمهورية اللبنانية</span>‎ <i><i>al-Jumhūrīyah al-Lubnānīyah</i></i>) upon its independence in 1943.

<p>
The borders of contemporary Lebanon are a product of the <a>Treaty of Sèvres</a> of 1920. Its territory was in the core of the Bronze Age <a>Canaanite</a> (Phoenician) city-states. As part of the Levant, it was part of numerous succeeding empires throughout ancient history, including the <a>Egyptian</a>, <a>Assyrian</a>, <a>Babylonian</a>, <a>Achaemenid Persian</a>, Hellenistic, <a>Roman</a> and <a>Sasanid Persian</a> empires.

</p>
<p>
After the 7th-century <a>Muslim conquest of the Levant</a>, it was part of the Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid Seljuk and Fatimid empires. The <a>crusader state</a> of the County of Tripoli, founded by Raymond IV of Toulouse in 1102, encompassed most of present-day Lebanon, falling to the Mamluk Sultanate in 1289 and finally to the Ottoman Empire in 1516.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> With the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, Greater Lebanon fell under French mandate in 1920,<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> and gained independence under president Bechara El Khoury in 1943. Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of relative political stability and prosperity based on Beirut's position as a regional center for finance and trade, interspersed with political turmoil and armed conflict (1948 Arab–Israeli War, Lebanese Civil War 1975–1990, 2005 Cedar Revolution, 2006 Lebanon War, 2007 Lebanon conflict, 2006–08 Lebanese protests, 2008 conflict in Lebanon, 2011 Syrian Civil War spillover, and 2019–20 Lebanese protests).<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>

<p>
Evidence dating back to an early settlement in Lebanon was found in <a>Byblos</a>, considered among the <a>oldest continuously inhabited cities</a> in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and <a>burial jars</a> left by the <a>Neolithic</a> and <a>Chalcolithic</a> fishing communities who lived on the shore of the <a>Mediterranean</a> Sea over 7,000 years ago.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Lebanon was part of northern <a>Canaan</a>, and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants, the <a>Phoenicians</a>, a seafaring people who spread across the Mediterranean in the first millennium BC.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> The most prominent Phoenician cities were <a>Byblos</a>, <a>Sidon</a> and <a>Tyre</a>, while their most famous colonies were <a>Carthage</a> in present-day <a>Tunisia</a> and <a>Cádiz</a> in present-day Spain. The <a>Phoenicians</a> are credited with the invention of the <a>oldest verified alphabet</a>, which subsequently inspired the Greek alphabet and the Latin one thereafter.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The cities of Phoenicia were incorporated into the Persian <a>Achaemenid Empire</a> by <a>Cyrus the Great</a> in 539 BCE.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> The Phoenician city-states were later incorporated into the empire of <a>Alexander the Great</a> following the <a>Siege of Tyre</a> in 332 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>
The region that is now Lebanon, as with the rest of Syria and much of <a>Anatolia</a>, became a major center of Christianity in the <a>Roman Empire</a> during the early spread of the faith. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named <a>Maron</a> established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of <a>monotheism</a> and <a>asceticism</a>, near the Mediterranean mountain range known as <a>Mount Lebanon</a>. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among Lebanese in the region. These Christians came to be known as <a>Maronites</a> and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> During the frequent <a>Roman-Persian Wars</a> that lasted for many centuries, the <a>Sassanid Persians</a> occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 629.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the 7th century the Muslim Arabs <a>conquered Syria</a> establishing a new regime to replace the <a>Byzantines</a>. Though Islam and the Arabic language were officially dominant under this new regime, the general populace nonetheless only gradually converted from Christianity and the Syriac language. The Maronite community, in particular, managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria.

</p>
<p>

The relative (but not complete) isolation of the Lebanese mountains meant the mountains served as a refuge in the times of religious and political crises in the <a>Levant</a>. As such, the mountains displayed religious diversity and existence of several well established sects and religions, notably, <a>Maronites</a>, <a>Druze</a>, <a>Shiite Muslims</a>, <a>Ismailis</a>, <a>Alawites</a> and <a>Jacobites</a>.
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Byblos_Libanon_2003.JPG/220px-Byblos_Libanon_2003.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
During the 11th century the <a>Druze</a> religion emerged from a branch of <a>Shia Islam</a>. The new religion gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The southern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families to the early 14th century. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. <a>Keserwan</a>, <a>Jabal Amel</a> and the <a>Beqaa Valley</a> was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, <a>Sidon</a>, <a>Tyre</a>, <a>Acre</a>, <a>Tripoli</a>, <a>Beirut</a>, and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture.

</p>
<p>
Following the fall of Roman <a>Anatolia</a> to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the <a>Crusades</a> launched by the <a>Franks</a> from Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially <a>Syria</a> and <a>Palestine</a> (the <i><a>Levant</a></i>). The <a>First Crusade</a> succeeded in temporarily establishing the <a>Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> and the <a>County of Tripoli</a> as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

</p>
<p>
Among the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e., the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the <a>Eastern Mediterranean</a>, who swore allegiance to <a>Constantinople</a> or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

<p>
During this period Lebanon was divided into several provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley, and <a>Jabal Amel</a>.

<p>
In southern Mount Lebanon in 1590, <a>Fakhr-al-Din II</a> became the successor to <a>Korkmaz</a>. He soon established his authority as paramount prince of the Druze in the Shouf area of Mount Lebanon. Eventually, Fakhr-al-Din II was appointed <a>Sanjakbey</a> (Governor) of several Ottoman sub-provinces, with responsibility for tax-gathering. He extended his control over a substantial part of Mount Lebanon and its coastal area, even building a fort as far inland as <a>Palmyra</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> This over-reaching eventually became too much for Ottoman Sultan <a>Murad IV</a>, who sent a punitive expedition to capture him in 1633. He was taken to <a>Istanbul</a>, kept in prison for two years and then executed along with one of his sons in April 1635.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Surviving members of Fakhr al-Din's family ruled a reduced area under closer Ottoman control until the end of the 17th century.

<p>
On the death of the last Maan emir, various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830. The relationship between the <a>Druze</a> and <a>Christians</a> in Lebanon has been characterized by <a>harmony</a> and peaceful <a>coexistence</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> with amicable relations between the two groups prevailing throughout history, with the exception of some periods, including <a>1860 Mount Lebanon civil war</a>; Approximately 10,000 Christians <a>were killed</a> by the Druzes during inter-communal violence in 1860.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> Shortly afterwards, the <a>Emirate of Mount Lebanon</a>, which lasted about 400 years, was replaced by the <a>Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate</a>, as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the <a>Règlement Organique</a>. The <i>Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate</i><sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> (1861–1918, <a>Arabic</a>: <span>متصرفية جبل لبنان</span>‎; <a>Turkish</a>: <i>Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı</i>) was one of the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>'s subdivisions following the <a>Tanzimat</a> reform. After 1861 there existed an autonomous Mount Lebanon with a Christian <a>mutasarrıf</a>, which had been created as a homeland for the <a>Maronites</a> under European diplomatic pressure following the <a>1860 massacres</a>. The <a>Maronite</a><a>Catholics</a>  and the <a>Druze</a> founded modern Lebanon in the early eighteenth century, through the ruling and social system known as the "<a>Maronite-Druze dualism</a>" in Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>
The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the <a>Al Ali Alsagheer</a> in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865 when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. <a>Youssef Bey Karam</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era.

</p>
<p>
Around 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount Lebanon <a>died</a> of starvation during World War I.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1920, following <a>World War I</a>, the area of the Mutasarrifate, plus some surrounding areas which were predominantly <a>Shia</a> and <a>Sunni</a>, became a part of the state of <a>Greater Lebanon</a> under the <a>Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> In the first half of 1920, Lebanese territory was claimed as part of the <a>Arab Kingdom of Syria</a>, but shortly the <a>Franco-Syrian War</a> resulted in Arab defeat and capitulation of the Hashemites.

</p>
<p>
On 1 September 1920, France reestablished <a>Greater Lebanon</a> after the Moutasarrifiya rule removed several regions belonging to the Principality of Lebanon and gave them to Syria.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> Lebanon was a largely Christian country (mainly <a>Maronite</a> territory with some <a>Greek Orthodox</a> enclaves) but it also included areas containing many Muslims and <a>Druze</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> On 1 September 1926, France formed the Lebanese Republic. A constitution was adopted on 25 May 1926 establishing a democratic republic with a parliamentary system of government.

<p>
Lebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> General <a>Henri Dentz</a>, the <a>Vichy</a><a>High Commissioner</a>  for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through <a>Syria</a> to <a>Iraq</a> where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that <a>Nazi Germany</a> would gain full control of Lebanon and <a>Syria</a> by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General <a>Charles de Gaulle</a> visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941, General <a>Georges Catroux</a> announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the <a>Free French</a> government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. In the face of international pressure, the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943. The <a>allies</a> occupied the region until the end of World War II.

<p>
Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the <a>League of Nations</a> or its successor the <a>United Nations</a>. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality."<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the <a>United Nations Charter</a> by the <a>five permanent members</a>, as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.

</p>
<p>
Lebanon's unwritten <a>National Pact</a> of 1943 required that its president be Maronite Christian, its <a>speaker of the parliament</a> to be a <a>Shia Muslim</a>, its prime minister be <a>Sunni Muslim</a>, and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament and the Deputy Prime Minister be <a>Greek Orthodox</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>

Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and turmoil interspersed with prosperity built on <a>Beirut</a>'s position as a regional center for finance and trade.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighbouring Arab countries in a <a>war against Israel</a>. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armoured cars, volunteers and logistical support.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army – led by the then <a>Minister of National Defense</a>, <a>Emir Majid Arslan</a> – captured <a>Al-Malkiyya</a>. This was Lebanon's only success in the war.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
100,000 <a>Palestinians</a> fled to Lebanon because of the war. Israel <a>did not permit their return</a> after the cease-fire.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> As of 2017 between 174,000 and 450,000 Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon with about half in refugee camps (although these are often decades old and resemble neighborhoods).<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> Palestinians often cannot obtain <a>Lebanese citizenship</a> or even <a>Lebanese identity cards</a> and are legally barred from owning property or performing certain occupations (including law, medicine, and engineering).<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> According to <a>Human Rights Watch</a>, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon live in "appalling social and economic conditions."

</p>
<p>
In 1958, during the last months of President <a>Camille Chamoun</a>'s term, <a>an insurrection</a> broke out, instigated by Lebanese Muslims who wanted to make Lebanon a member of the <a>United Arab Republic</a>. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 <a>United States Marines</a> were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general <a>Fuad Chehab</a>.

</p>
<p>
With the 1970 <a>defeat</a> of the <a>PLO</a> in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their <a>armed campaign</a> against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.

<p>

In 1975, following increasing sectarian tensions, largely boosted by <a>Palestinian militant relocation</a> into South Lebanon, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The <a>Lebanese Civil War</a> pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the <a>PLO</a>, left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In June 1976, Lebanese President <a>Elias Sarkis</a> asked for the Syrian Army to intervene on the side of the Christians and help restore peace.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> In October 1976 the <a>Arab League</a> agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian <a>Arab Deterrent Force</a>, which was charged with restoring calm.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>

<p>

PLO attacks from Lebanon into Israel in 1977 and 1978 escalated tensions between the countries. On 11 March 1978, eleven Fatah fighters landed on a beach in northern Israel and hijacked two buses full of passengers on the Haifa – Tel-Aviv road, shooting at passing vehicles in what became known as the <a>Coastal Road massacre</a>. They killed 37 and wounded 76 Israelis before being killed in a firefight with Israeli forces.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Israel invaded Lebanon four days later in <a>Operation Litani</a>. The <a>Israeli Army</a> occupied most of the area south of the <a>Litani River</a>. The <a>UN Security Council</a> passed <a>Resolution 425</a> calling for immediate Israeli withdrawal and creating the <a>UN Interim Force in Lebanon</a> (UNIFIL), charged with attempting to establish peace.
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/BlueLine.jpg/220px-BlueLine.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Israeli forces withdrew later in 1978, but retained control of the southern region by managing a 19-kilometre-wide (12 mi) security zone along the border. These positions were held by the <a>South Lebanon Army</a> (SLA), a Christian militia under the leadership of Major <a>Saad Haddad</a> backed by Israel. The Israeli Prime Minister, <a>Likud</a>'s <a>Menachem Begin</a>, compared the plight of the Christian minority in southern Lebanon (then about 5% of the population in SLA territory) to that of European Jews during World War II.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> The PLO routinely <a>attacked</a> Israel during the period of the cease-fire, with over 270 documented attacks.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> People in Galilee regularly had to leave their homes during these shellings. Documents captured in PLO headquarters after the invasion showed they had come from Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> Arafat refused to condemn these attacks on the grounds that the cease-fire was only relevant to Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
In April 1980 the presence of UNIFIL soldiers in the buffer zone led to the <a>At Tiri incident</a>. On 17 July 1981, Israeli aircraft bombed multi-story apartment buildings in Beirut that contained offices of PLO associated groups. The Lebanese delegate to the United Nations Security Council claimed that 300 civilians had been killed and 800 wounded. The bombing led to worldwide condemnation, and a temporary embargo on the export of U.S. aircraft to Israel.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

In August 1981, defense minister <a>Ariel Sharon</a> began to draw up plans to attack PLO military infrastructure in West Beirut, where PLO headquarters and command bunkers were located.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In 1982, the <a>PLO</a> attacks from Lebanon on Israel led to <a>an Israeli invasion</a>, aiming to support Lebanese forces in driving out the PLO. A <a>multinational force</a> of American, French and Italian contingents (joined in 1983 by a British contingent) were deployed in Beirut after <a>the Israeli siege of the city</a>, to supervise the evacuation of the PLO. The civil war re-emerged in September 1982 after the assassination of Lebanese President <a>Bashir Gemayel</a>, an Israeli ally, and subsequent fighting. During this time a number of sectarian massacres occurred, such as in <a>Sabra and Shatila</a>, and in <a>several refugee camps</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup> The multinational force was withdrawn in the spring of 1984, following <a>a devastating bombing attack</a> during the previous year.

</p>
<p>
In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi–Moroccan–Algerian committee to solve the crisis. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the same month, the Lebanese Parliament agreed to the <a>Taif Agreement</a>, which included an outline timetable for Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and a formula for the de-confessionalisation of the Lebanese political system.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> The civil war ended at the end of 1990 after sixteen years; it had caused massive loss of human life and property, and devastated the country's economy. It is estimated that 150,000 people were killed and another 200,000 wounded.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> Nearly a million civilians were displaced by the war, and some never returned.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> Parts of Lebanon were left in ruins.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> The Taif Agreement has still not been implemented in full and Lebanon's political system continues to be divided along sectarian lines.

</p>
<p>
Conflict between Israel and Lebanese militants continued, leading to a series of violent events and clashes including the <a>Qana massacre</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> In May 2000, Israeli forces fully withdrew from Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> Since then, the 25th of May is regarded by the Lebanese as the <a>Liberation Day</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>

<p>
The internal political situation in Lebanon significantly changed in the early 2000s. After the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the death of former president <a>Hafez Al-Assad</a> in 2000, the Syrian military presence faced criticism and resistance from the Lebanese population.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 14 February 2005, former Prime Minister <a>Rafik Hariri</a> was assassinated in a <a>car bomb</a> explosion.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> Leaders of the <a>March 14 Alliance</a> accused <a>Syria</a> of the attack,<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup> while Syria and the <a>March 8 Alliance</a> claimed that Israel was behind the assassination. The Hariri assassination marked the beginning of a series of assassinations that resulted in the death of many prominent Lebanese figures.<sup><a href="#ref_nb 5">[nb 5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The assassination triggered the <a>Cedar Revolution</a>, a series of demonstrations which demanded the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the establishment of an international commission to investigate the assassination. Under pressure from the West, Syria began withdrawing,<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> and by 26 April 2005 all Syrian soldiers had returned to Syria.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>UNSC Resolution 1595</a> called for an investigation into the assassination.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup> The <a>UN International Independent Investigation Commission</a> published preliminary findings on 20 October 2005 in the <a>Mehlis report</a>, which cited indications that the assassination was organized by Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 12 July 2006, <a>Hezbollah</a> launched a series of rocket attacks and <a>raids</a> into Israeli territory, where they killed three Israeli soldiers and captured two others.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> Israel responded with <a>airstrikes</a> and <a>artillery</a> fire on targets in Lebanon, and a ground invasion of <a>southern Lebanon</a>, resulting in the <a>2006 Lebanon War</a>. The conflict was officially ended by the <a>UNSC Resolution 1701</a> on 14 August 2006, which ordered a ceasefire.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> Some 1,191 Lebanese<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup> and 160 Israelis<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup> were <a>killed</a> in the conflict. Beirut's southern suburb was heavily damaged by Israeli airstrikes.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup>

In 2007, the <a>Nahr al-Bared</a> refugee camp became the center of the <a>2007 Lebanon conflict</a> between the Lebanese Army and <a>Fatah al-Islam</a>. At least 169 soldiers, 287 insurgents and 47 civilians were killed in the battle. Funds for the reconstruction of the area have been slow to materialize.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Between 2006 and 2008, <a>a series of protests</a> led by groups opposed to the pro-Western Prime Minister <a>Fouad Siniora</a> demanded the creation of a national unity government, over which the mostly Shia opposition groups would have veto power. When <a>Émile Lahoud</a>'s presidential term ended in October 2007, the opposition refused to vote for a successor unless a power-sharing deal was reached, leaving Lebanon without a president.

</p>
<p>
On 9 May 2008, <a>Hezbollah</a> and <a>Amal</a> forces, sparked by a government declaration that Hezbollah's communications network was illegal, seized western <a>Beirut</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> leading to the <a>2008 conflict in Lebanon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> The Lebanese government denounced the violence as a coup attempt.<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> At least 62 people died in the resulting clashes between pro-government and opposition militias.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup> On 21 May 2008, the signing of the <a>Doha Agreement</a> ended the fighting.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup> As part of the accord, which ended 18 months of political paralysis,<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup><a>Michel Suleiman</a>  became president and a national unity government was established, granting a veto to the opposition.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> The agreement was a victory for opposition forces, as the government caved in to all their main demands.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup>

<p>
In early January 2011, the <a>national unity government</a> collapsed due to growing tensions stemming from the <a>Special Tribunal for Lebanon</a>, which was expected to indict Hezbollah members for the Hariri assassination.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> The parliament elected <a>Najib Mikati</a>, the candidate for the Hezbollah-led <a>March 8 Alliance</a>, Prime Minister of Lebanon, making him responsible for forming a new government.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup> Hezbollah leader <a>Hassan Nasrallah</a> insists that Israel was responsible for the assassination of Hariri.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup> A report leaked by the <a>Al-Akhbar</a> newspaper in November 2010 stated that Hezbollah has drafted plans for a takeover of the country in case the Special Tribunal for Lebanon issues an indictment against its members.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2012, the <a>Syrian civil war</a> threatened to spill over in Lebanon, causing more <a>incidents of sectarian violence</a> and armed clashes between <a>Sunnis</a> and <a>Alawites</a> in Tripoli.<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> According to <a>UNHCR</a>, the number of Syrian refugees in Lebanon increased from around 250,000 in early 2013 to 1,000,000 in late 2014.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup> In 2013, The <a>Lebanese Forces Party</a>, the <a>Kataeb Party</a> and the <a>Free Patriotic Movement</a> voiced concerns that the country's sectarian based political system is being undermined by the influx of Syrian refugees.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup> On 6 May 2015, <a>UNHCR</a> suspended registration of Syrian refugees at the request of the Lebanese government.<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> In February 2016, the Lebanese government signed the Lebanon Compact, granting a minimum of €400 million of support for refugees and vulnerable Lebanese citizens.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup> As of October 2016, the government estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians.<sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup>

<p>
As a result of the protests, Lebanon entered a political crisis, with Prime Minister <a>Saad Hariri</a> tendering his resignation and echoing protestors' demands for a government of independent specialists.<sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup> Other politicians targeted by the protests have remained in power. On 19 December 2019, former Minister of Education <a>Hassan Diab</a> was designated the next prime minister and tasked with forming a new cabinet.<sup><a href="#ref_136">[136]</a></sup> Protests and acts of <a>civil disobedience</a> have since continued, with protesters denouncing and condemning the designation of Diab as prime minister.<sup><a href="#ref_137">[137]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_138">[138]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup> Lebanon is suffering the worst <a>economic crisis</a> in decades.<sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_141">[141]</a></sup> Lebanon is the first country in the Middle East and North Africa to see its inflation rate exceed 50% for 30 consecutive days, according to Steve H. Hanke, professor of applied economics at the Johns Hopkins University.<sup><a href="#ref_142">[142]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On August 4 of 2020, <a>an explosion at the port of Beirut</a>, Lebanon's main port, destroyed the surrounding areas, killing over 200 people, and injuring thousands more. The cause of the explosion was later determined to be 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been unsafely stored, and accidentally set on fire that Tuesday afternoon.<sup><a href="#ref_143">[143]</a></sup> Less than a week after the explosion, on August 10, 2020, Hassan Diab, the prime minister that had been designated less than a year before, addressed the nation and announced his resignation. Demonstrations continued into 2021 with Lebanese blocking the roads with burned tires protesting against the poverty and the economic crisis.

<p>
On 11 March 2021 the caretaker minister of energy warned that Lebanon is threatened with "total darkness" at the end of March if no money was secured to buy fuel for power stations.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup> A <a>large fuel explosion in Northern Lebanon</a> killed 28 people in August 2021.<sup><a href="#ref_145">[145]</a></sup> On 9 October 2021 the entire nation lost power for 24 hours after its two main power stations ran out of power due to the currency and fuel shortage.<sup><a href="#ref_146">[146]</a></sup><a>Days later, sectarian violence in Beirut</a>  killed a number of people in the deadliest clashes in the country since 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup>

Lebanon is located in Western Asia between latitudes <a>33°</a> and <a>35° N</a> and longitudes <a>35°</a> and <a>37° E</a>. Its land straddles the "northwest of the <a>Arabian plate</a>".<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The country's surface area is 10,452 square kilometres (4,036 sq mi) of which 10,230 square kilometres (3,950 sq mi) is <a>land</a>. Lebanon has a coastline and border of 225 kilometres (140 mi) on the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a> to the west, a 375 kilometres (233 mi) border shared with <a>Syria</a> to the north and east and a 79 kilometres (49 mi) long border with Israel to the south.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> The <a>border</a> with the Israeli-occupied <a>Golan Heights</a> is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called <a>Shebaa Farms</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_150">[150]</a></sup>

<p>
Lebanon is divided into four distinct <a>physiographic</a> regions: the coastal plain, the <a>Lebanon mountain</a> range, the <a>Beqaa valley</a> and the <a>Anti-Lebanon mountains</a>.

</p>
<p>
The narrow and discontinuous <a>coastal plain</a> stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the <a>Akkar</a> plain to <a>Ras al-Naqoura</a> at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited <a>alluvium</a> alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches.
The Lebanon mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of <a>limestone</a> and <a>sandstone</a> that runs for most of the country's length. The mountain range varies in width between 10 km (6 mi) and 56 km (35 mi); it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at 3,088 metres (10,131 ft) <a>above sea level</a> in <a>Qurnat as Sawda'</a> in <a>North Lebanon</a> and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of 2,695 metres (8,842 ft) in <a>Mount Sannine</a>. The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti-Lebanon range in the east; it is a part of the <a>Great Rift Valley</a> system. The valley is 180 km (112 mi) long and 10 to 26 km (6 to 16 mi) wide, its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits. The Anti-Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains, its highest peak is in <a>Mount Hermon</a> at 2,814 metres (9,232 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The mountains of Lebanon are drained by <a>seasonal torrents</a> and <a>rivers</a> foremost of which is the 145 kilometres (90 mi) long <a>Leontes</a> that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of <a>Baalbek</a> and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> Lebanon has <a>16 rivers</a> all of which are <a>non navigable</a>; 13 rivers originate from <a>Mount Lebanon</a> and run through the steep gorges and into the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>, the other three arise in the <a>Beqaa Valley</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_151">[151]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Lebanon">Climate of Lebanon</a></div>
<p>
Lebanon has a moderate <a>Mediterranean climate</a>. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_152">[152]</a></sup> Although most of Lebanon receives a relatively large amount of rainfall, when measured annually in comparison to its arid surroundings, certain areas in north-eastern Lebanon receives only little because of the <a>rain shadow</a> created by the high peaks of the western mountain range.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>

<p>
In ancient times, Lebanon was covered by large forests of <a>cedar trees</a>, the national emblem of the country.<sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup> Millennia of deforestation have altered the hydrology in Mount Lebanon and changed the regional climate adversely.<sup><a href="#ref_155">[155]</a></sup> As of 2012, forests covered 13.4% of the Lebanese land area;<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup> they are under constant threat from <a>wildfires</a> caused by the long dry summer season.<sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As a result of longstanding exploitation, few old cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon, but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests. The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting by creating the right conditions for <a>germination</a> and growth. The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars, including the <a>Shouf Biosphere Reserve</a>, the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the <a>Tannourine</a> Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the <a>Cedars of God</a> near <a>Bsharri</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_158">[158]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_160">[160]</a></sup> Lebanon had a 2019 <a>Forest Landscape Integrity Index</a> mean score of 3.76/10, ranking it 141st globally out of 172 countries.<sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2010, the Environment Ministry set a 10-year plan to increase the national forest coverage by 20%, which is equivalent to the planting of two million new trees each year.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup> The plan, which was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (<a>USAID</a>), and implemented by the <a>U.S. Forest Service</a> (USFS), through the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI), was inaugurated in 2011 by planting cedar, pine, wild almond, juniper, fir, oak and other seedlings, in ten regions around Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup> As of 2016, forests covered 13.6% of Lebanon, and other wooded lands represented a further 11%.<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup> Since 2011, over 600,000 trees, including cedars and other native species, have been planted throughout the country as part of the Lebanon Reforestation Initiative (LRI).<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Lebanon contains two terrestrial ecoregions: <a>Eastern Mediterranean conifer-sclerophyllous-broadleaf forests</a> and <a>Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup>

Beirut and Mount Lebanon have been facing a severe garbage crisis. After the closure of the Bourj Hammoud dump in 1997, the al-Naameh dumpsite was opened by the government in 1998. The al-Naameh dumpsite was planned to contain 2 million tons of waste for a limited period of six years at the most. It was designed to be a temporary solution, while the government would have devised a long-term plan. Sixteen years later al-Naameh was still open and exceeded its capacity by 13 million tons. In July 2015 the residents of the area, already protesting in the recent years, forced the closure of the dumpsite. The inefficiency of the government, as well as the corruption inside of the waste management company Sukleen in charge of managing the garbage in Lebanon, have resulted in piles of garbage blocking streets in Mount Lebanon and Beirut.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Bsharridistrictmountains.jpg/220px-Bsharridistrictmountains.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
In December 2015, the Lebanese government signed an agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining, part owned by <a>Chinook Sciences</a>, to export over 100,000 tons of untreated waste from <a>Beirut</a> and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the county's largest land fill site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in Holland and Germany. The contract is reported to cost $212 per ton. The waste, which is compacted and infectious, would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2,000 containers.<sup><a href="#ref_167">[167]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_168">[168]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_169">[169]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup> Initial reports that the waste was to be exported to <a>Sierra Leone</a> have been denied by diplomats.<sup><a href="#ref_171">[171]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In February 2016, the government withdrew from negotiations after it was revealed that documents relating to the export of the trash to Russia were forgeries.<sup><a href="#ref_172">[172]</a></sup> On 19 March 2016, the Cabinet reopened the Naameh landfill for 60 days in line with a plan it passed few days earlier to end the trash crisis. The plan also stipulates the establishment of landfills in <a>Bourj Hammoud</a> and Costa Brava, east and south of Beirut respectively. Sukleen trucks began removing piled garbage from Karantina and heading to Naameh. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced during a chat with activists that over 8,000 tons of garbage had been collected up to that point in only 24 hours as part of the government's trash plan. The plan's execution was ongoing at last report.<sup><a href="#ref_173">[173]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup> In 2017, Human Rights Watch found that Lebanon's garbage crisis, and open burning of waste in particular, was posing a health risk to residents and violating the state's obligations under international law.<sup><a href="#ref_175">[175]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In September 2018, Lebanon's parliament passed a law that banned open dumping and burning of waste. Despite penalties set in case of violations, Lebanese municipalities have been openly burning the waste, putting the lives of people in danger. In October 2018, <a>Human Rights Watch</a> researchers witnessed the open burning of dumps in al-Qantara and <a>Qabrikha</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_176">[176]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On Sunday 13 October 2019 at night, a series of about 100 <a>forest fires</a> according to <a>Lebanese Civil Defense</a>, broke out and spread over large areas of Lebanon's forests. Lebanese Prime Minister <a>Saad Al-Hariri</a> confirmed his contact with a number of countries to send assistance via helicopters and firefighting planes,<sup><a href="#ref_177">[177]</a></sup> Cyprus, Jordan, Turkey and Greece participated in firefighting. According to press reports on Tuesday (15 October), fire has decreased in different places due to the rains,<sup><a href="#ref_178">[178]</a></sup> after <a>churches</a> and <a>mosques</a> called on citizens to perform raining prayers.<sup><a href="#ref_179">[179]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_180">[180]</a></sup>

<p>
Lebanon is a <a>parliamentary democracy</a> that includes <a>confessionalism</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_181">[181]</a></sup> in which high-ranking offices are reserved for members of specific religious groups. The <a>President</a>, for example, has to be a <a>Maronite</a> Christian, the <a>Prime Minister</a> a <a>Sunni Muslim</a>, the <a>Speaker of the Parliament</a> a <a>Shi’a Muslim</a>, the <a>Deputy Prime Minister</a> and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament <a>Eastern Orthodox</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_182">[182]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_183">[183]</a></sup> This system is intended to deter sectarian conflict and to represent fairly the demographic distribution of the 18 recognized religious groups in government.<sup><a href="#ref_184">[184]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_185">[185]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until 1975, <a>Freedom House</a> considered Lebanon to be among only two (together with Israel) <a>politically free</a> countries in the Middle East and North Africa region.<sup><a href="#ref_186">[186]</a></sup> The country lost this status with the outbreak of the Civil War, and has not regained it since. Lebanon was rated "Partly Free" in 2013. Even so, Freedom House still ranks Lebanon as among the most democratic nations in the Arab world.<sup><a href="#ref_186">[186]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until 2005, <a>Palestinians</a> were forbidden to work in over 70 jobs because they did not have <a>Lebanese citizenship</a>. After liberalization laws were passed in 2007, the number of banned jobs dropped to around 20.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> In 2010, Palestinians were granted the same rights to work as other foreigners in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_187">[187]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

Lebanon's national legislature is the <a>unicameral</a><a>Parliament of Lebanon</a> . Its 128 seats are <a>divided</a> equally between Christians and Muslims, proportionately between the 18 different denominations and proportionately between its 26 regions.<sup><a href="#ref_188">[188]</a></sup> Prior to 1990, the ratio stood at 6:5 in favor of Christians; however, the <a>Taif Agreement</a>, which put an end to the 1975–1990 civil war, adjusted the ratio to grant equal representation to followers of the two religions.<sup><a href="#ref_182">[182]</a></sup>

<p>
The Parliament is elected for a four-year term by popular vote on the basis of sectarian proportional representation.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The executive branch consists of the President, the <a>head of state</a>, and the Prime Minister, the <a>head of government</a>. The parliament elects the president for a non-renewable six-year term by a two-thirds majority. The president appoints the Prime Minister,<sup><a href="#ref_189">[189]</a></sup> following consultations with the parliament. The president and the prime minister form a cabinet, which must also adhere to the sectarian distribution set out by confessionalism.

</p>
<p>
In an unprecedented move, the Lebanese parliament has extended its own term twice amid protests, the last being on 5 November 2014,<sup><a href="#ref_190">[190]</a></sup> an act which comes in direct contradiction with democracy and article #42 of the Lebanese constitution as no elections have taken place.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Lebanon was without a President between May 2014 and October 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_191">[191]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_192">[192]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nationwide elections were finally scheduled for <a>May 2018</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_193">[193]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As of August 2019, the Lebanese cabinet included two ministers directly affiliated with <a>Hezbollah</a>, in addition to a close but officially non-member minister.<sup><a href="#ref_194">[194]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Law">Law</h3>
<p>
There are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts.<sup><a href="#ref_195">[195]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Grand_Serail%2C_Government_Palace%2C_Beirut.jpg/220px-Grand_Serail%2C_Government_Palace%2C_Beirut.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The Lebanese legal system is based on the <a>French system</a>, and is a <a>civil law</a> country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the <a>Sharia</a> law.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup> For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the <a>Vatican Rota court</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_197">[197]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The most notable set of codified laws is the Code des Obligations et des Contrats promulgated in 1932 and equivalent to the <a>French Civil Code</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup><a>Capital punishment</a>  is still de facto used to sanction certain crimes, but no longer enforced.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Lebanese court system consists of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.<sup><a href="#ref_198">[198]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1990 article 95 was amended to provide that the parliament shall take necessary measures to abolish political structure based on religious affiliation, but that until such time only the highest positions in public civil service, including the judiciary, military, security forces, public and mixed institutions, shall be divided equally between Christians and Muslims without regard to the denominational affiliation within each community.<sup><a href="#ref_199">[199]</a></sup>

Lebanon concluded negotiations on an association agreement with the European Union in late 2001, and both sides initialled the accord in January 2002. It is included in the European Union's <a>European Neighbourhood Policy</a> (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. Lebanon also has bilateral trade agreements with several Arab states and is working toward accession to the <a>World Trade Organization</a>.

</p>
<p>
Lebanon enjoys good relations with virtually all of the other Arab countries (despite historic tensions with Libya and Syria), and hosted an <a>Arab League</a> Summit in March 2002 for the first time in over 35 years. Lebanon is a member of the <a>Francophonie</a> countries and hosted the Francophonie Summit in October 2002 as well as the <a>Jeux de la Francophonie</a> in <a>2009</a>.

The Lebanese economy went through a significant expansion after the <a>war of 2006</a>, with growth averaging 9.1% between 2007 and 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup> After 2011 the local economy was affected by the <a>Syrian civil war</a>, growing by a yearly average of 1.7% on the 2011–2016 period and by 1.5% in 2017.<sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup> In 2018, the size of the GDP was estimated to be $54.1 billion.<sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Lebanon has a very high level of public debt and large external financing needs.<sup><a href="#ref_210">[210]</a></sup> The 2010 public debt exceeded 150.7% of GDP, ranking fourth highest in the world as a percentage of GDP, though down from 154.8% in 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> At the end 2008, finance minister <a>Mohamad Chatah</a> stated that the debt was going to reach $47 billion in that year and would increase to $49 billion if privatization of two telecoms companies did not occur.<sup><a href="#ref_213">[213]</a></sup> The <a>Daily Star</a> wrote that exorbitant debt levels have "slowed down the economy and reduced the government's spending on essential development projects".<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The urban population in Lebanon is noted for its commercial enterprise.<sup><a href="#ref_215">[215]</a></sup> Emigration has yielded Lebanese "commercial networks" throughout the world.<sup><a href="#ref_216">[216]</a></sup> Remittances from Lebanese abroad total $8.2 billion<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup> and account for one-fifth of the country's economy.<sup><a href="#ref_218">[218]</a></sup> Lebanon has the largest proportion of skilled labor among Arab States.<sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

The <a>Investment Development Authority of Lebanon</a> was established with the aim of promoting investment in Lebanon. In 2001, Investment Law No.360<sup><a href="#ref_220">[220]</a></sup> was enacted to reinforce the organisation's mission.

<p>
The <a>agricultural sector</a> employs 12% of the total <a>workforce</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup> Agriculture contributed to 5.9% of the country's GDP in 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_222">[222]</a></sup> Lebanon's proportion of cultivable land is the highest in the Arab world,<sup><a href="#ref_223">[223]</a></sup> Major produce includes apples, peaches, oranges, and lemons.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>commodities market</a> in Lebanon includes substantial <a>gold coin</a> production, however according to <a>International Air Transport Association</a><b>(IATA)</b>  standards, they must be declared upon exportation to any foreign country.<sup><a href="#ref_224">[224]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Oil</a> has recently been discovered inland and in the seabed between Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt and talks are underway between <a>Cyprus</a> and <a>Egypt</a> to reach an agreement regarding the exploration of these resources. The seabed separating Lebanon and Cyprus is believed to hold significant quantities of crude oil and natural gas.<sup><a href="#ref_225">[225]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Industry in Lebanon is mainly limited to small businesses that reassemble and package imported parts. In 2004, industry ranked second in workforce, with 26% of the Lebanese working population,<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup> and second in GDP contribution, with 21% of Lebanon's GDP.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nearly 65% of the Lebanese workforce attain employment in the services sector.<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup> The GDP contribution, accordingly, amounts to roughly 67.3% of the annual Lebanese GDP.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> However, dependence on the tourism and banking sectors leaves the economy vulnerable to political instability.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Lebanese banks are high on liquidity and reputed for their security.<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> Lebanon was among only seven countries in the world where the value of the stock markets increased in 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_227">[227]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 10 May 2013 the Lebanese minister of energy and water clarified that seismic images of the Lebanese's sea bed are undergoing detailed explanation of their contents and that up till now, approximately 10% have been covered. Preliminary inspection of the results showed, with over 50% probability, that 10% of Lebanon's exclusive economic zone held up to 660 million barrels of oil and up to 30×10<sup>12</sup> cu ft of gas.<sup><a href="#ref_228">[228]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Syrian crisis has significantly affected Lebanese economic and financial situation. The demographic pressure imposed by the Syrian refugees now living in Lebanon has led to competition in the labour market. As a direct consequence unemployment has doubled in three years, reaching 20% in 2014. A loss of 14% of wages regarding the salary of less-skilled workers has also been registered. The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate increased with 170,000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and losses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian refugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every year.<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup>

<p>
In the 1950s, GDP growth was the second highest in the world. Despite having no oil reserves, Lebanon, as the Middle East's banking center and among its trading center, had a high national income.<sup><a href="#ref_230">[230]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

The 1975–1990 civil war heavily damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure,<sup><a href="#ref_201">[201]</a></sup> cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a West Asian <a>entrepôt</a> and banking hub.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> The subsequent period of relative peace enabled the central government to restore control in <a>Beirut</a>, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to key port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers, with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports, and international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange.<sup><a href="#ref_231">[231]</a></sup>

Until July 2006, Lebanon enjoyed considerable stability, Beirut's reconstruction was almost complete,<sup><a href="#ref_232">[232]</a></sup> and increasing numbers of tourists poured into the nation's resorts.<sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup> The economy witnessed growth, with bank assets reaching over 75 billion US dollars,<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup><a>Market capitalization</a>  was also at an all-time high, estimated at $10.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2006.<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup> The month-long <a>2006 war</a> severely damaged Lebanon's fragile economy, especially the tourism sector. According to a preliminary report published by the Lebanese <a>Ministry of Finance</a> on 30 August 2006, a major economic decline was expected as a result of the fighting.<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Over the course of 2008 Lebanon rebuilt its infrastructure mainly in the real estate and tourism sectors, resulting in a comparatively robust post war economy. Major contributors to the reconstruction of Lebanon include <a>Saudi Arabia</a> (with US$1.5 billion pledged),<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup> the European Union (with about $1 billion)<sup><a href="#ref_237">[237]</a></sup> and a few other Persian Gulf countries with contributions of up to $800 million.<sup><a href="#ref_238">[238]</a></sup>

The tourism industry accounts for about 10% of <a>GDP</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_239">[239]</a></sup> Lebanon attracted around 1,333,000 tourists in 2008, thus placing it as 79th out of 191 countries.<sup><a href="#ref_240">[240]</a></sup> In 2009, <i>The New York Times</i> ranked Beirut the No. 1 travel destination worldwide due to its nightlife and hospitality.<sup><a href="#ref_241">[241]</a></sup> In January 2010, the <a>Ministry of Tourism</a> announced that 1,851,081 tourists had visited Lebanon in 2009, a 39% increase from 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_242">[242]</a></sup> In 2009, Lebanon hosted the largest number of tourists to date, eclipsing the previous record set before the <a>Lebanese Civil War</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_243">[243]</a></sup> Tourist arrivals reached two million in 2010, but fell by 37% for the first 10 months of 2012, a decline caused by the war in neighbouring Syria.<sup><a href="#ref_239">[239]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Saudi Arabia</a>, Jordan, and Japan are the three most popular origin countries of foreign tourists to Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_244">[244]</a></sup> The recent influx of Japanese tourists has caused the recent rise in popularity of <a>Japanese cuisine</a> in Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_245">[245]</a></sup>

According to surveys from the World Economic Forum's 2013 Global Information Technology Report, Lebanon has been ranked globally as the fourth best country for math and science education, and as the tenth best overall for quality of education. In quality of management schools, the country was ranked 13th worldwide.<sup><a href="#ref_246">[246]</a></sup>

In 2010, spending on healthcare accounted for 7.03% of the country's GDP. In 2009, there were 31.29 physicians and 19.71 nurses per 10,000 inhabitants.<sup><a href="#ref_260">[260]</a></sup> The life expectancy at birth was 72.59 years in 2011, or 70.48 years for males and 74.80 years for females.<sup><a href="#ref_261">[261]</a></sup>

<p>
By the end of the civil war, only one-third of the country's public hospitals were operational, each with an average of 20 beds. By 2009 the country had 28
public hospitals, with a total of 2,550 beds, while the country had approximatel 25 public hospitals.<sup><a href="#ref_262">[262]</a></sup> At public hospitals, hospitalized uninsured patients pay 5% of the bill, in comparison with 15% in private hospitals, with the <a>Ministry of Public Health</a> reimbursing the remainder.<sup><a href="#ref_262">[262]</a></sup> The Ministry of Public Health contracts with 138 private hospitals and 25 public hospitals.<sup><a href="#ref_263">[263]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2011, there were 236,643 subsidized admissions to hospitals; 164,244 in private hospitals, and 72,399 in public hospitals. More patients visit private hospitals than public hospitals, because the private beds supply is higher.<sup><a href="#ref_263">[263]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the Ministry of Public Health in Lebanon, the top 10 leading causes of reported hospital deaths in 2017 were: malignant neoplasm of bronchus or lung (4.6%), Acute <a>myocardial infarction</a> (3%), <a>pneumonia</a> (2.2%), exposure to unspecified factor, unspecified place (2.1%), <a>acute kidney injury</a> (1.4%), intra-cerebral hemorrhage (1.2%), malignant neoplasm of colon (1.2%), malignant neoplasm of pancreas (1.1%), malignant neoplasm of prostate (1.1%), malignant neoplasm of bladder (0.8%).<sup><a href="#ref_264">[264]</a></sup>

The population of Lebanon was estimated to be 6,859,408 in 2018, with the number of <a>Lebanese nationals</a> estimated to be 4,680,212 (July 2018 est.);<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> however, no official census has been conducted since 1932 due to the sensitive <a>confessional political balance</a> between Lebanon's various religious groups.<sup><a href="#ref_266">[266]</a></sup> Identifying all Lebanese as ethnically <a>Arab</a> is a widely employed example of <a>panethnicity</a> since in reality, the Lebanese "are descended from many different peoples who are either indigenous, or have occupied, invaded, or settled this corner of the world", making Lebanon, "a mosaic of closely interrelated cultures".<sup><a href="#ref_267">[267]</a></sup> While at first glance, this ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity might seem to cause civil and political unrest, "for much of Lebanon’s history this multitudinous diversity of religious communities has coexisted with little conflict".<sup><a href="#ref_267">[267]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>fertility rate</a> fell from 5.00 in 1971 to 1.75 in 2004. Fertility rates vary considerably among the different religious groups: in 2004, it was 2.10 for <a>Shiites</a>, 1.76 for <a>Sunnis</a> and 1.61 for <a>Maronites</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_268">[268]</a></sup>

Lebanon has witnessed a series of migration waves: over 1,800,000 people emigrated from the country in the 1975–2011 period.<sup><a href="#ref_268">[268]</a></sup> Millions of <a>people of Lebanese descent</a> are spread throughout the world, mostly Christians,<sup><a href="#ref_269">[269]</a></sup> especially in <a>Latin America</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_270">[270]</a></sup><a>Brazil</a>  and <a>Argentina</a> have large expatriate population.<sup><a href="#ref_271">[271]</a></sup><i>(See <a>Lebanese people</a>)</i> .

(see <a>Lebanese Canadians</a>). United States also has one the largest Lebanese
population, at around 2,000,000.<sup><a href="#ref_276">[276]</a></sup> Another region with a significant diaspora are Gulf Countries, where the countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar (around 25,000 people),<sup><a href="#ref_277">[277]</a></sup> Saudi Arabia and UAE act as host countries to many Lebanese. 269,000 Lebanese citizens currently reside in Saudi Arabia.<sup><a href="#ref_278">[278]</a></sup> Around a third of the Lebanese workforce, about 350,000, live in Gulf countries according to some sources.<sup><a href="#ref_279">[279]</a></sup>

As of 2012<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, Lebanon was host to over 1,600,000 <a>refugees</a> and <a>asylum</a> seekers: 449,957 from <a>Palestine</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> 100,000 from <a>Iraq</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_280">[280]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_281">[281]</a></sup> over 1,100,000 from <a>Syria</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_282">[282]</a></sup> and at least 4,000 from <a>Sudan</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_283">[283]</a></sup> According to the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia of the United Nations, among the Syrian refugees, 71% live in poverty.<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup> A 2013 estimate by the United Nations put the number of <a>Syrian refugees</a> at over 1,250,000.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup>

<p>
In the last three decades, lengthy and destructive <a>armed conflicts</a> have ravaged the country. The majority of Lebanese have been affected by armed conflict; those with direct personal experience include 75% of the population, and most others report suffering a range of hardships. In total, almost the entire population (96%) has been affected in
some way – either personally or because of the wider consequences of armed conflict.<sup><a href="#ref_284">[284]</a></sup>

Lebanon is the most religiously diverse country in the Middle East.<sup><a href="#ref_285">[285]</a></sup> The <a>CIA World Factbook</a> estimates (2020) the following (data do not include Lebanon's sizable Syrian and Palestinian refugee populations): <a>Muslim</a> 61.1% (30.6% <a>Sunni</a>, 30.5% <a>Shia</a>, smaller percentages of <a>Alawites</a> and <a>Ismailis</a>), <a>Christian</a> 33.7% (<a>Maronite Catholics</a> are the largest Christian group), <a>Druze</a> 5.2%, and very small numbers of <a>Jews</a>, <a>Baha'is</a>, <a>Buddhists</a>, and <a>Hindus</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_286">[286]</a></sup> A study conducted by the Lebanese Information Center and based on voter registration numbers shows that by 2011 the Christian population was stable compared to that of previous years, making up 34.35% of the population; Muslims, the Druze included, were 65.47% of the population.<sup><a href="#ref_287">[287]</a></sup> The <a>World Values Survey</a> of 2014 put the percentage of <a>atheists</a> in Lebanon at 3.3%.<sup><a href="#ref_288">[288]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
It is believed that there has been a decline in the ratio of Christians to Muslims over the past 60 years, due to higher emigration rates of Christians, and a higher birth rate in the Muslim population.<sup><a href="#ref_289">[289]</a></sup> When the last census was held in 1932, Christians made up 53% of Lebanon's population.<sup><a href="#ref_268">[268]</a></sup> In 1956, it was estimated that the population was 54% Christian and 44% Muslim.<sup><a href="#ref_268">[268]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

A demographic study conducted by the research firm <a>Statistics Lebanon</a> found that approximately 27% of the population was <a>Sunni</a>, 27% <a>Shia</a>, 21% <a>Maronite</a>, 8% <a>Greek Orthodox</a>, 5% <a>Druze</a>, 5% <a>Melkite</a>, and 1% <a>Protestant</a>, with the remaining 6% mostly belonging to smaller non-native to Lebanon Christian denominations.<sup><a href="#ref_289">[289]</a></sup>

</p>
<p>
Because the relative sizes of different religions and religious sects remains a sensitive issue, a national census has not been conducted since 1932.<sup><a href="#ref_289">[289]</a></sup> There are 18 state-recognized religious sects – four <a>Muslim</a>, 12 <a>Christian</a>, one <a>Druze</a>, and one <a>Jewish</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_289">[289]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Sunni residents</a> primarily live in Tripoli, Western Beirut, the Southern coast of Lebanon, and Northern Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Shi'a residents</a> primarily live in Southern Beirut, the <a>Beqaa Valley</a>, and <a>Southern Lebanon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Maronite Catholic residents</a> primarily live in Eastern Beirut and the mountains of Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup> They are the largest Christian community in Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Greek Orthodox</a>, the second largest Christian community in Lebanon, primarily live in Koura, Beirut, Rachaya, Matn, Aley, Akkar, in the countryside around Tripoli, Hasbaya and Marjeyoun. They are a minority of 10% in Zahle.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The Greek Catholics live mainly in Beirut, on the eastern slopes of the Lebanon mountains and in Zahle which is predominantly Greek Catholic.<sup><a href="#ref_294">[294]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the Christian village of Hadat, there has been a municipal ban on Muslims from buying or renting property. It has been claimed that it is due to an underlying fear of mixing with one another's salvation since for three decades, the village of Hadat has been predominantly Christian.<sup><a href="#ref_295">[295]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_296">[296]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Lebanese government tend to count its <a>Druze</a> citizens as part of its <a>Muslim</a> population,<sup><a href="#ref_297">[297]</a></sup> even though most <a>Druze</a> do not identify as <a>Muslims</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_298">[298]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_299">[299]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_300">[300]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_301">[301]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_302">[302]</a></sup> and they do not accept the <a>five pillars of Islam</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_303">[303]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Language">Language</h3>
<p>
Article 11 of Lebanon's Constitution states that "Arabic is the official national language. A law determines the cases in which the <a>French language</a> is to be used".<sup><a href="#ref_304">[304]</a></sup> The majority of Lebanese people speak <a>Lebanese Arabic</a>, which is grouped in a larger category called <a>Levantine Arabic</a>, while <a>Modern Standard Arabic</a> is mostly used in magazines, newspapers, and formal broadcast media. <a>Lebanese Sign Language</a> is the language of the Deaf community.

</p>
<p>
There is also significant presence <a>of French</a>, and <a>of English</a>.
Almost 40% of Lebanese are considered francophone, and another 15% "partial francophone", and 70% of Lebanon's secondary schools use French as a second language of instruction.<sup><a href="#ref_305">[305]</a></sup> By comparison, English is used as a secondary language in 30% of Lebanon's secondary schools.<sup><a href="#ref_305">[305]</a></sup> The use of French is a legacy of France's historic ties to the region, including its <a>League of Nations mandate</a> over Lebanon following World War I; as of 2005<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, some 20% of the population used French on a daily basis.<sup><a href="#ref_306">[306]</a></sup> The use of Arabic by Lebanon's educated youth is declining, as they usually prefer to speak in French and, to a lesser extent, English, which are seen as more fashionable.<sup><a href="#ref_307">[307]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_308">[308]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
English is increasingly used in science and business interactions.<sup><a href="#ref_309">[309]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_310">[310]</a></sup><a>Lebanese citizens</a>  of <a>Armenian</a>, <a>Greek</a>, or <a>Assyrian</a> descent often speak their ancestral languages with varying degrees of fluency. As of 2009<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, there were around 150,000 Armenians in Lebanon, or around 5% of the population.<sup><a href="#ref_311">[311]</a></sup>

<p>
The culture of Lebanon reflects the legacy of various civilizations spanning thousands of years. Originally home to the <a>Canaanite</a>-<a>Phoenicians</a>, and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the <a>Assyrians</a>, the <a>Persians</a>, the <a>Greeks</a>, the <a>Romans</a>, the Arabs, the <a>Fatimids</a>, the Crusaders, the <a>Ottoman Turks</a> and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups. Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine. Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they "share an almost common culture".<sup><a href="#ref_312">[312]</a></sup><a>Lebanese Arabic</a>  is universally spoken while food, music, and literature are deep-rooted "in wider Mediterranean and Arab Levantine norms".<sup><a href="#ref_312">[312]</a></sup>

<p>

In visual arts, <a>Moustafa Farroukh</a> was among Lebanon's most prominent painters of the 20th century. Formally trained in Rome and Paris, he exhibited in venues from Paris to New York to Beirut over his career.<sup><a href="#ref_313">[313]</a></sup> Many more contemporary artists are active, such as <a>Walid Raad</a>, a contemporary media artist residing in New York.<sup><a href="#ref_314">[314]</a></sup> In the field of photography, the <a>Arab Image Foundation</a> has a collection of over 400,000 photographs from Lebanon and the Middle East. The photographs can be viewed in a research center and various events and publications have been produced in Lebanon and worldwide to promote the collection.

<p>
Lebanon celebrates national and both <a>Christian</a> and <a>Muslim</a> holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the <a>Gregorian Calendar</a> and <a>Julian Calendar</a>. <a>Greek Orthodox</a> (with the exception of Easter), <a>Catholics</a>, <a>Protestants</a>, and <a>Melkite</a> Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian <a>Apostolic</a> Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar. Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning). Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day. Music festivals, often hosted at historical sites, are a customary element of Lebanese culture.<sup><a href="#ref_327">[327]</a></sup> Among the most famous are <a>Baalbeck International Festival</a>, <a>Byblos International Festival</a>, <a>Beiteddine International Festival</a>, <a>Jounieh International Festival</a>, Broumana Festival, <a>Batroun International Festival</a>, <a>Ehmej Festival</a>, Dhour Chwer Festival and Tyr Festival.<sup><a href="#ref_327">[327]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_328">[328]</a></sup> These festivals are promoted by Lebanon's <a>Ministry of Tourism</a>. Lebanon hosts about 15 concerts from international performers each year, ranking 1st for nightlife in the Middle East, and 6th worldwide.<sup><a href="#ref_329">[329]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Cuisine">Cuisine</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_cuisine">Lebanese cuisine</a></div>
<p>
Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as Syria, Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus. The Lebanese national dishes are the <a>kibbe</a>, a meat pie made from finely minced <a>lamb</a> and <a>burghul</a> (cracked <a>wheat</a>), and the <a>tabbouleh</a>, a salad made from <a>parsley</a>, <a>tomatoes</a>, and burghul. The national beverage is <a>arak</a>, a strong <a>anise</a>-flavored liquor made from fermented <a>grape juice</a>. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki. Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of <a>mezze</a> - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled <a>meat</a> or <a>fish</a>. In general, meals are finished with <a>Arabic coffee</a> and fresh <a>fruit</a>, though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well. <a>M'Juhdara</a>, a thick stew of <a>onions</a>, <a>rice</a>, and <a>lentils</a>, is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around <a>Lent</a> by people in the Lebanese diaspora. Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, <a>wine</a> is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards exist in the <a>Bekaa valley</a> and elsewhere. <a>Beer</a> is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which <a>almaza</a> is perhaps the most popular.

The power of the map over the mind was great:"[H]ow could a nation resist being found if a nineteenth-century map had predicted it?" In the Middle East, Lebanon seems to offer a corresponding example. When the idea of a Greater Lebanon in 1908 was put forward in a book by Bulus Nujaym, a Lebanese Maronite writing under the pseudonym of M. Jouplain, he suggested that the natural boundaries of Lebanon were exactly the same as drawn in the 1861 and 1863 staff maps of the French military expedition to Syria, maps that added territories on the northern, eastern and southern borders, plus the city of Beirut, to the Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon. In this case, too, the prior existence of a European military map seems to have created a fact on the ground.</q>
