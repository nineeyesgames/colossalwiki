The <b>Isle of Man</b> (<a>Manx</a>: <i>Mannin</i><small></small><span><a>[ˈmanɪnʲ]</a></span> , also <i>Ellan Vannin</i><small></small><span><a>[ˈɛlʲan ˈvanɪnʲ]</a></span> ), also known as <b>Mann</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>m</span><span>æ</span><span>n</span></span>/</a></span></span>), is an island and self-governing <a>British Crown Dependency</a> in the <a>Irish Sea</a> between <a>Great Britain</a> and <a>Northern Ireland</a>. The <a>head of state</a>, <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, holds the title <a>Lord of Mann</a> and is represented by a <a>Lieutenant Governor</a>. The <a>United Kingdom</a> is responsible for the isle's military defence.

</p>
<p>
Humans have lived on the island since before 6500 BC. <a>Gaelic</a> cultural influence began in the 5th century AD, and the <a>Manx language</a>, a branch of the <a>Goidelic Languages</a>, emerged. In 627, King <a>Edwin of Northumbria</a> conquered the Isle of Man along with most of <a>Mercia</a>. In the 9th century, <a>Norsemen</a> established the <a>thalassocratic</a><a>Kingdom of the Isles</a> , which included the Isle of Man. <a>Magnus III</a>, King of <a>Norway</a> from 1093 to 1103, reigned as <a>King of Mann and the Isles</a> between 1099 and 1103.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1266, the island became part of <a>Scotland</a> under the <a>Treaty of Perth</a>, after being ruled by Norway. After a period of alternating rule by the Kings of Scotland and <a>England</a>, the island came under the feudal lordship of the <a>English Crown</a> in 1399. The lordship <a>revested</a> in the <a>British Crown</a> in 1765, but the island did not become part of the 18th-century <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, nor of its successors, the <a>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> and the present-day <a>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>. It has always retained its internal self-government.

</p>
<p>
In 1881, the Isle of Man <a>Parliament</a>, <a>Tynwald</a>, became the first national <a>legislative body</a> in the world to give <a>women the right to vote</a> in a general election, although this excluded married women.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> In 2016, <a>UNESCO</a> awarded the Isle of Man <a>biosphere reserve status</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>

Insurance and <a>online gambling</a> each generate 17% of the <a>GNP</a>, followed by <a>information and communications technology</a> and banking with 9% each.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Internationally, the Isle of Man is known for the <a>TT</a> Motorcycle Races,<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> and the <a>Manx Cat</a>, a breed with short or no tails.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Name">Name</h2>
<p>
The Manx name of the Isle of Man is <i><i>Ellan Vannin</i></i>: <i><i>ellan</i></i> (<small>Manx pronunciation: </small><span><a>[ɛlʲan]</a></span>) is a Manx word meaning "island"; <i><i>Mannin</i></i> (<small>IPA: </small><span><a>[manɪnʲ]</a></span>) appears in the <a>genitive case</a> as <i><i>Vannin</i></i> (<small>IPA: </small><span><a>[vanɪnʲ]</a></span>), with <a>initial consonant mutation</a>, hence <i><i>Ellan Vannin</i></i>, "Island of Mann". The short form used in <a>English</a> is spelled either Mann or Man. The earliest recorded Manx form of the name is <i><i>Manu</i></i> or <i><i>Mana</i></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Old Irish</a> form of the name is <i><i>Manau</i></i> or <i><i>Mano</i></i>. <a>Old Welsh</a> records named it as <i><i>Manaw</i></i>, also reflected in <i><i><a>Manaw Gododdin</a></i></i>, the name for an ancient district in north Britain along the lower <a>Firth of Forth</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
The oldest known reference to the island calls it <i><i>Mona</i></i>, in <a>Latin</a> (<a>Julius Caesar</a>, 54 BC); in the 1st century AD, <a>Pliny the Elder</a> records it as <i><i>Monapia</i></i> or <i><i>Monabia</i></i>, and <a>Ptolemy</a> (2nd century) as <i>Monœda</i> (<span>Mοναοιδα</span>, <i>Monaoida</i>) or <span>Mοναρινα</span> (<i>Monarina</i>), in <a>Koine Greek</a>.
Later Latin references have <i><i>Mevania</i></i> or <i><i>Mænavia</i></i> (<a>Orosius</a>, 416),<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
and <i><i>Eubonia</i></i> or <i><i>Eumonia</i></i> by Irish writers. It is found in the <a>Sagas of Icelanders</a> as <i><i>Mön</i></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The name is probably cognate with the <a>Welsh</a> name of the island of <a>Anglesey</a>, <i><i>Ynys Môn</i></i>,<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
usually derived from a <a>Celtic</a> word for 'mountain' (reflected in Welsh <i><i>mynydd</i></i>, <a>Breton</a><i><i>menez</i></i> , and <a>Scottish Gaelic</a><i><i>monadh</i></i> ),<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
from a <a>Proto-Celtic</a><i>*moniyos</i> .

</p>
<p>
The name was at least secondarily associated with that of <a>Manannán mac Lir</a> in <a>Irish mythology</a> (corresponding to Welsh <i><i><a>Manawydan</a> fab Llŷr</i></i>).<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> In the earliest Irish mythological texts, Manannán is a king of the <a>otherworld</a>, but the 9th-century <i><a>Sanas Cormaic</a></i> identifies a <a>euhemerised</a> Manannán as "a famous merchant who resided in, and gave name to, the Isle of Man".<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> Later, a Manannán is recorded as the first <a>king of Mann</a> in a Manx poem (dated 1504).<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>
The island was cut off from the surrounding islands around 8000 BC as sea levels rose following the end of the ice age. Humans colonised it by travelling by sea some time before <a>6500 BC</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> The first occupants were <a>hunter-gatherers</a> and fishermen. Examples of their tools are kept at the Manx Museum.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Neolithic Period</a> marked the beginning of farming, and the people began to build <a>megalithic monuments</a>, such as <a>Cashtal yn Ard</a> near <a>Maughold</a>, <a>King Orry's Grave</a> at <a>Laxey</a>, Meayll Circle near <a>Cregneash</a>, and Ballaharra Stones at <a>St John's</a>. There were also the local <a>Ronaldsway</a> and Bann cultures.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the <a>Bronze Age</a>, the size of burial mounds decreased. The people put bodies into stone-lined graves with ornamental containers. The Bronze Age burial mounds survived as long-lasting markers around the countryside.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The ancient Romans knew of the island and called it <i><i>Insula Manavia</i>.</i><sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> Scholars have not determined whether they conquered the island.

</p>
<p>
Around the 5th century AD, large-scale migration from Ireland precipitated a process of <a>Gaelicisation</a>, evidenced by <a>Ogham</a> inscriptions, and the <a>Manx language</a> developed. It is a <a>Goidelic language</a> closely related to <a>Irish</a> and <a>Scottish Gaelic</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the 7th century, Mann came under <a>Anglo-Saxon</a> control, specifically King <a>Edwin</a> of <a>Northumbria</a>, from which he launched raids into <a>Ireland</a>. How much influence the Northumbrians exerted on Mann is unknown, but very few place names on Mann are of <a>Old English</a> origin.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Vikings</a> arrived at the end of the 8th century. They established <a>Tynwald</a> and introduced many land divisions that still exist. In 1266 <a>King Magnus VI of Norway</a> ceded the islands to Scotland in the Treaty of Perth. But Scotland's rule over Mann did not become firmly established until 1275, when the Manx were defeated in the <a>Battle of Ronaldsway</a>, near <a>Castletown</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1290 King <a>Edward I of England</a> sent <a>Walter de Huntercombe</a> to take possession of Mann. It remained in English hands until 1313, when <a>Robert Bruce</a> took it after besieging <a>Castle Rushen</a> for five weeks. In 1314, it was retaken for the English by John Bacach of Argyll. In 1317, it was retaken for the Scots by <a>Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray</a> and Lord of the Isle of Man. It was held by the Scots until 1333. For some years thereafter control passed back and forth between the kingdoms until the English took it for the final time in 1346.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> The English Crown delegated its rule of the island to a series of lords and magnates. <a>Tynwald</a> passed laws concerning the government of the island in all respects and had control over its finances, but was subject to the approval of the <a>Lord of Mann</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1866, the Isle of Man obtained limited home rule, with partly democratic elections to the <a>House of Keys</a>, but the <a>Legislative Council</a> was appointed by the Crown. Since then, democratic government has been gradually extended.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man has designated more than 250 historic sites as <a>registered buildings</a>.

<p>
The Isle of Man is an island located in the middle of the northern <a>Irish Sea</a>, almost equidistant from <a>England</a> to the east, <a>Northern Ireland</a> to the west, and <a>Scotland</a> (closest) to the north; while <a>Wales</a> to the south is almost the distance of the <a>Republic of Ireland</a> to the southwest. It is 52 kilometres (32 mi) long and, at its widest point, 22 kilometres (14 mi) wide. It has an area of around 572 square kilometres (221 sq mi).<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> Besides the island of Mann itself, the political unit of the Isle of Man includes some nearby small islands: the seasonally inhabited <a>Calf of Man</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup><a>Chicken Rock</a>  (on which stands an unstaffed lighthouse), <a>St Patrick's Isle</a> and <a>St Michael's Isle</a>. The last two of these are connected to the main island by permanent roads/causeways.

</p>
<p>
Ranges of hills in the north and south are separated by a central valley. The northern plain, by contrast, is relatively flat, consisting mainly of deposits from glacial advances from western Scotland during colder times. There are more recently deposited <a>shingle beaches</a> at the northernmost point, the <a>Point of Ayre</a>. The island has one mountain higher than 600 metres (2,000 ft), <a>Snaefell</a>, with a height of 620 metres (2,034 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> According to an old saying, from the summit one can see six kingdoms: those of Mann, Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales, and <a>Heaven</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> Some versions add a seventh kingdom, that of the sea, or <a>Neptune</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>

<p>
At the 2016 census,<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> the Isle of Man was home to 83,314 people, of whom 26,997 resided in the island's <a>capital</a>, <a>Douglas</a>, and 9,128 in the adjoining village of <a>Onchan</a>. The population decreased by 1.4% between the 2011 and 2016 censuses. By country of birth, those born in the Isle of Man were the largest group (49.8%), while those born in the United Kingdom were the next largest group at 40% (33.9% in <a>England</a>, 3% in <a>Scotland</a>, 2% in <a>Northern Ireland</a> and 1.1% in Wales), 1.8% in the <a>Republic of Ireland</a> and 0.75% in the <a>Channel Islands</a>. The remaining 8.5% were born elsewhere in the world, with 5% coming from EU countries (other than Ireland).

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man Full Census, last held in 2016,<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> has been a decennial occurrence since 1821, with interim censuses being introduced from 1966. It is separate from, but similar to, the <a>Census in the United Kingdom</a>.

</p>
<p>
The 2001 census was conducted by the Economic Affairs Division of the <a>Isle of Man Treasury</a>, under the authority of the Census Act 1929.

The island's parliament, <a>Tynwald</a>, is claimed to have been in continuous existence since 979 or earlier, purportedly making it the oldest continuously governing body in the world, though evidence supports a much later date.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> Tynwald is a <a>bicameral or tricameral</a> legislature, comprising the <a>House of Keys</a> (directly elected by universal suffrage with a voting age of 16 years) and the <a>Legislative Council</a> (consisting of indirectly elected and <a>ex-officio members</a>). These two bodies also meet together in joint session as Tynwald Court.

</p>
<p>
The executive branch of government is the <a>Council of Ministers</a>, which is composed of Members of Tynwald (usually Members of the House of Keys, though Members of the Legislative Council may also be appointed as Ministers). It is headed by the <a>Chief Minister</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Vice-regal</a> functions of the head of state are performed by a <a>lieutenant governor</a>.

<p>
In various laws of the United Kingdom, "the United Kingdom" is defined to exclude the Isle of Man. Historically, the UK has taken care of its external and defence affairs, and retains paramount power to legislate for the Island. However, in 2007, the Isle of Man and the UK signed an agreement<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> that established frameworks for the development of the international identity of the Isle of Man. There is no separate Manx citizenship. Citizenship is covered by UK law, and Manx people are classed as British citizens. There is a long history of relations and cultural exchange between the Isle of Man and Ireland. The Isle of Man's historic <a>Manx language</a> (and its modern revived variant) are closely related to both Scottish Gaelic and the Irish language, and in 1947, Irish Taoiseach <a>Éamon de Valera</a> spearheaded efforts to save the dying Manx language.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Under <a>British law</a>, the Isle of Man is not part of the United Kingdom. However, the UK takes care of its external and defence affairs.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> There are no independent military forces on the Isle of Man, although <a>HMS <i>Ramsey</i></a> is affiliated with the <a>town of the same name</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> From 1938 to 1955 there was the <a>Manx Regiment</a> of the British <a>Territorial Army</a>, which saw extensive action during the <a>Second World War</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> In 1779, the <a>Manx Fencible Corps</a>, a <a>fencible</a> regiment of three companies, was raised; it was disbanded in 1783 at the end of the <a>American War of Independence</a>. Later, the <a>Royal Manx Fencibles</a> was raised at the time of the <a>French Revolutionary Wars</a> and <a>Napoleonic Wars</a>. The 1st Battalion (of 3 companies) was raised in 1793. A 2nd Battalion (of 10 companies) was raised in 1795,<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> and it saw action during the <a>Irish Rebellion of 1798</a>. The regiment was disbanded in 1802.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> A third body of Manx Fencibles was raised in 1803 to defend the island during the <a>Napoleonic Wars</a> and to assist the Revenue. It was disbanded in 1811.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> The <a>Isle of Man Home Guard</a> was raised during the <a>Second World War</a> for home defence.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> In 2015 a multi-capability recruiting and training unit of the <a>British Army Reserve</a> was established in Douglas.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>

<p>
There is no citizenship of the Isle of Man as such under the British Nationality Acts <a>1948</a> and <a>1981</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Passport Office, Isle of Man, Douglas, accepts and processes applications for the <a>Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man</a>, who is formally responsible for issuing Isle of Man–issued British passports, titled "<i>British Islands – Isle of Man</i><span>"</span>.

</p>
<p>
Isle of Man-issued British passports can presently be issued to any British citizen resident in the Isle of Man, and also to British citizens who have a qualifying close personal connection to the Isle of Man, but are now resident either in the UK or in either one of the two other Crown Dependencies.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man was never part of the <a>European Union</a>, nor did it have a <a>special status</a>, and thus it did not take part in the 2016 <a>referendum</a> on the UK's <a>EU</a> membership.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> However, Protocol 3 of the UK's Act of Accession to the <a>Treaty of Rome</a> included the Isle of Man within the <a>EU's customs area</a>, allowing for trade in Manx goods without tariffs throughout the EU.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> As it was not part of the <a>EU's internal market</a>, there are still limitations on the movement of capital, services and labour.

</p>
<p>
EU citizens were entitled to travel and reside, but not work, in the island without restriction. British citizens with Manxman status were under the same circumstances and restrictions as any other non-EU European relating country to work in the EU.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The political and diplomatic impacts of <a>Brexit</a> on the island are still uncertain. The UK confirmed that the Crown Dependencies' positions were included in the <a>Brexit negotiations</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> The <a>Brexit withdrawal agreement</a> explicitly included the Isle of Man in its territorial scope, but makes no other mention of it.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> The island's government website stated that after the end of the implementation period, the Isle of Man's relationship with the EU would depend on the agreement reached between the UK and the EU on their future relationship.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man is not a member of the <a>Commonwealth of Nations</a>. By virtue of its relationship with the United Kingdom, it takes part in several Commonwealth institutions, including the <a>Commonwealth Parliamentary Association</a> and the <a>Commonwealth Games</a>. The <a>Government of the Isle of Man</a> has made calls for a more integrated relationship with the Commonwealth,<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> including more direct representation and enhanced participation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> The <a>Chief Minister of the Isle of Man</a> has said: "A closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a welcome further development of the island's international relationships."<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>

Most Manx politicians stand for election as independents rather than as representatives of political parties. Although political parties do exist, their influence is not nearly as strong as in the United Kingdom.

<p>
There are three political parties in the Isle of Man:

<ul><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Vannin_Party">Liberal Vannin Party</a> (established 2006) has one seat in the House of Keys; it promotes greater Manx autonomy and more accountability in government.</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manx_Labour_Party">Manx Labour Party</a> is active, and for much of the 20th century had several MHKs. Currently there are 2 MLP members in the House of Keys, both of whom are women.</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Green_Party">Isle of Man Green Party</a> was established in 2016, but currently only has representation at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_Isle_of_Man">local government</a> level.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
There are also a number of pressure groups on the island. <a>Mec Vannin</a> advocate the establishment of a <a>sovereign</a><a>republic</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> The <a>Positive Action Group</a> campaign for three key elements to be introduced into the governance of the island: open accountable government, rigorous control of public finances, and a fairer society.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>

<p>
Local government on the Isle of Man is based partly on the island's 17 ancient parishes. There are two types of local authorities:

</p>
<ul><li>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation">corporation</a> for the Borough of Douglas, and bodies of commissioners for the town districts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castletown,_Isle_of_Man">Castletown</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel,_Isle_of_Man">Peel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey,_Isle_of_Man">Ramsey</a>, and</li><li>the village districts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Michael">Kirk Michael</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onchan">Onchan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Erin">Port Erin</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_St_Mary">Port St Mary</a>, and the 14 "parish districts" (those parishes or parts of parishes which do not fall within the districts previously mentioned). Each of these districts also has its own body of commissioners.</li></ul>
<p>
Local authorities are under the supervision of the Isle of Man Government's Department of Local Government and the Environment (DOLGE).

Health and social care on the Isle of Man is the responsibility of the <a>Department of Health and Social Care</a>. Healthcare is free for residents and visitors from the UK.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Emergency_services">Emergency services</h3>
<p>
The Isle of Man Government maintains five emergency services.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> These are:

</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Constabulary">Isle of Man Constabulary</a> (police)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Coastguard">Isle of Man Coastguard</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Fire_and_Rescue_Service">Isle of Man Fire and Rescue Service</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Ambulance_Service">Isle of Man Ambulance Service</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_Civil_Defence_Corps">Isle of Man Civil Defence Corps</a></li></ul>
<p>
All of these services are controlled directly by the <a>Department of Home Affairs</a> of the Isle of Man Government, and are independent of the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, the Isle of Man Constabulary voluntarily submits to inspection by the British inspectorate of police,<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> and the Isle of Man Coastguard contracts Her Majesty's Coastguard (UK) for air-sea rescue operations.

</p>
<h3 id="Crematorium">Crematorium</h3>
<p>
The island's sole crematorium is in Glencrutchery Road, Douglas, and is operated by Douglas Borough Council. Usually staffed by four, in March 2020 an increase of staff to 12 was announced by the council leader, responding to the threat of <a>coronavirus</a>, which could require more staff.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Economy">Economy</h2>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Isle_of_Man">Economy of the Isle of Man</a></div>
<p>
The Isle of Man <a>Department for Enterprise</a> manages the diversified economy in 12 key sectors.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> The largest sectors by GNP are insurance and <a>eGambling</a> with 17% of GNP each, followed by <a>ICT</a> and banking with 9% each. The 2016 census lists 41,636 total employed.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> The largest sectors by employment are "medical and health", "financial and business services", construction, retail and public administration.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> Manufacturing, focused on aerospace and the food and drink industry,<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> employs almost 2000 workers and contributes about 5% of <a>gross domestic product</a> (GDP). The sector provides laser optics, industrial diamonds, electronics, plastics and aerospace precision engineering. Tourism, agriculture, and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, now make very little contributions to the island's GDP.

</p>
<p>
The unemployment rate is around 5%.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man is a low-tax economy with no <a>capital gains tax</a>, <a>wealth tax</a>, <a>stamp duty</a>, or <a>inheritance tax</a><sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> and a top rate of <a>income tax</a> of 20%.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> A tax cap is in force: the maximum amount of tax payable by an individual is £200,000 or £400,000 for couples if they choose to have their incomes jointly assessed. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a <a>remittance</a> basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the island.

</p>
<p>
The standard rate of <a>corporation tax</a> for residents and non-residents is 0%. Retail business profits above £500,000 and banking business income are taxed at 10%, and rental (or other) income from land and buildings situated on the Isle of Man is taxed at 20%.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>

<p>
Trade takes place mostly with the United Kingdom. The island is in customs union with the UK, and related revenues are pooled and shared under the <a>Common Purse Agreement</a>. This means that the Isle of Man cannot have the lower excise revenues on alcohol and other goods that are enjoyed in the <a>Channel Islands</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Manx government <a>promotes island locations for making films</a> by offering financial support. Since 1995, over 100 films have been made on the island.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> Most recently the island has taken a much wider strategy to attract the general digital media industry in film, television, video and <a>eSports</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man Government Lottery operated from 1986 to 1997. Since 2 December 1999 the island has participated in the <a>United Kingdom National Lottery</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> The island is the only jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom where it is possible to play the UK National Lottery.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> Since 2010 it has also been possible for projects in the Isle of Man to receive national lottery <a>Good Causes Funding</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> The good causes funding is distributed by the Manx Lottery Trust.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup><a>Tynwald</a>  receives the 12% lottery duty for tickets sold in the island.

</p>
<p>
Tourist numbers peaked in the first half of the 20th century, prior to the boom in cheap travel to Southern Europe that also saw the decline of tourism in many similar English seaside resorts. The Isle of Man tourism board has recently invested in "Dark Sky Discovery" sites to diversify its tourism industry. It is expected that dark skies will generally be nominated by the public across the UK. However, the Isle of Man tourism board tasked someone from their team to nominate 27 places on the island as a civil task. This cluster of the highest quality "Milky Way" sites<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> is now well promoted within the island. This government push has effectively given the island a headstart in the number of recognised Dark Sky sites. However, this has created a distorted view when compared to the UK where this is not promoted on a national scale. There, Dark Sky sites are expected to be nominated over time by the public across a full range of town, city and countryside locations rather than <i>en masse</i> by government departments.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2017 an office of <a>The International Stock Exchange</a> was opened to provide a boost for the island's finance industry.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>

The main telephone provider on the Isle of Man is <a>Manx Telecom</a>. The island has two mobile operators: Manx Telecom, previously known as Manx Pronto, and <a>Sure</a>. <a>Cloud9</a> operated as a third mobile operator on the island for a short time, but has since withdrawn.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Broadband internet services are available through four local providers: Wi-Manx, Domicilium, Manx Computer Bureau and <a>Manx Telecom</a>. The island does not have its own <a>ITU</a><a>country code</a> , but is accessed via the British country code (+44), and the island's telephone numbers are part of the <a>British telephone numbering plan</a>, with local dialling codes 01624 for landlines and 07524, 07624 and 07924 for mobiles. Calls to the island from the UK however, are generally charged differently from those within the UK, and may or may not be included in any "inclusive minutes" packages.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1996, the Isle of Man Government obtained permission to use the <a>.im</a> national <a>top-level domain</a> (TLD), and has ultimate responsibility for its use. The main is managed from day to day by Domicilium, an island-based internet service provider. In December 2007, the <a>Manx Electricity Authority</a> and its telecommunications subsidiary, e-llan Communications, commissioned the laying of a new fibre-optic link that connects the island to a worldwide fibre-optic network. In August 2021 it was reported that Elon Musk's satellite internet service, <a>Starlink</a>, had been granted a licence to operate from a ground station on the island.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man has three radio stations: <a>Manx Radio</a>, <a>Energy FM</a> and 3FM.

</p>
<p>
There is no insular television service, but local transmitters retransmit British mainland digital broadcasts via the free-to-air <a>digital terrestrial</a> service <a>Freeview</a>. The Isle of Man is served by <a>BBC North West</a> for <a>BBC One</a> and <a>BBC Two</a> television services, and <a>ITV Granada</a> for <a>ITV</a>.

</p>
<p>
Many television services are available by satellite, such as <a>Sky</a>, and <a>Freesat</a> from the group of satellites at <a>28.2° East</a>, as well as services from a range of other satellites around Europe such as the <a>Astra</a> satellites at <a>19.2° east</a> and <a>Hot Bird</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man has three newspapers, all weeklies, and all owned by <a>Isle of Man Newspapers</a>, a division of the Edinburgh media company <a>Johnston Press</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> The <i><a>Isle of Man Courier</a></i> (distribution 36,318) is free and distributed to homes on the island. The other two newspapers are <i><a>Isle of Man Examiner</a></i> (circulation 13,276) and the <i><a>Manx Independent</a></i> (circulation 12,255).<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>

The <a>Isle of Man Sea Terminal</a> in Douglas has regular ferries to and from <a>Heysham</a> and to and from <a>Liverpool</a>, with a more restricted timetable operating in winter. The two vessels are <i>The Manannan</i> and <i>The Ben My Chree</i> which will soon be replaced with a new vessel arriving in 2022 made by <a>Hyundai</a>. It has been named The Manxman by the public mid 2020. There are also limited summer-only services to and from <a>Belfast</a> and <a>Dublin</a>. The Dublin route also operates at Christmas. At the time of the <a>Isle of Man TT</a> a limited number of sailings operate to and from <a>Larne</a> in <a>Northern Ireland</a>. All ferries are operated by the <a>Isle of Man Steam Packet Company</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The only commercial airport on the island is the <a>Isle of Man Airport</a> at <a>Ronaldsway</a>. There are direct scheduled and chartered flights to numerous airports in the United Kingdom and Ireland.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The island has a total of 688 miles (1,107 km)<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup> of public roads, all of which are paved. There is no overriding national speed limit; only local speed limits are set, and some roads have no speed limit. Rules about reckless driving and most other driving regulations are enforced in a similar way to the UK.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> There is a requirement for regular vehicle examinations for some vehicles (similar to the MoT test in the UK).<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The island used to have an extensive <a>narrow-gauge railway</a> system, both steam-operated and electric, but the majority of the steam railway tracks were taken out of service many years ago, and the track removed. As of 2019<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, there is a <a>steam railway</a> between Douglas and Port Erin, an <a>electric railway</a> between Douglas and Ramsey and an <a>electric mountain railway</a> which climbs <a>Snaefell</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Isle_of_Man">Culture of the Isle of Man</a></div>
<p>
The culture of the Isle of Man is often promoted as being influenced by its <a>Celtic</a> and, to a lesser extent, its <a>Norse</a> origins. Proximity to the UK, popularity as a UK tourist destination in Victorian times, and immigration from Britain has meant that the cultures of Great Britain have been influential at least since <a>Revestment</a>. Revival campaigns have attempted to preserve the surviving vestiges of Manx culture after a long period of <a>Anglicisation</a>, and there has been significantly increased interest in the Manx language, history and musical tradition.

<p>
The official language of the Isle of Man is <a>English</a>. Manx has traditionally been spoken but has been stated to be "critically endangered".<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> However, it now has a growing number of young speakers.

</p>
<p>
Manx is a <a>Goidelic</a> Celtic language and is one of a number of <a>insular Celtic languages</a> spoken in the British Isles.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> Manx has been officially recognised as a legitimate <a>autochthonous</a><a>regional language</a>  under the <a>European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a>, ratified by the United Kingdom on 27 March 2001 on behalf of the Isle of Man government.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Manx is closely related to <a>Irish</a> and <a>Scottish Gaelic</a>, but is orthographically <a>sui generis</a>.

</p>
<p>
On the island, the <a>Manx</a> greetings <i><i>moghrey mie</i></i> (good morning) and <i><i>fastyr mie</i></i> (good afternoon) can often be heard.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the concepts of "evening" and "afternoon" are referred to with one word.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> Two other Manx expressions often heard are <i>Gura mie eu</i> ("Thank you"; familiar 2nd person singular form <i>Gura mie ayd</i>) and <i><i>traa dy liooar</i></i>, meaning "time enough", which represents a stereotypical view of the Manx attitude to life.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the 2011 Isle of Man census, approximately 1,800 residents could read, write, and speak the Manx language.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup>

<p>
For centuries, the island's symbol has been the so-called "three legs of Mann" (<a>Manx</a>: <i>Tree Cassyn Vannin</i>), a <a>triskelion</a> of three legs conjoined at the thigh. The Manx triskelion, which dates back with certainty to the late 13th century, is of uncertain origin. It has been suggested that its origin lies in <a>Sicily</a>, an island which has been associated with the triskelion since ancient times.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The symbol appears in the island's <a>official flag</a> and <a>official coat of arms</a>, as well as <a>its currency</a>. The Manx triskelion may be reflected in the island's motto, <i>Quocunque jeceris stabit</i>, which appears as part of the island's coat of arms. The Latin motto translates as "whichever way you throw, it will stand"<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> or "whithersoever you throw it, it will stand".<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> It dates to the late 17th century when it is known to have appeared on the island's coinage.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> It has also been suggested that the motto originally referred to the poor quality of coinage which was common at the time—as in "however it is tested it will pass".<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The ragwort or <i><a>cushag</a></i> has been referred to as the Manx national flower.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup>

<p>
The predominant religious tradition of the island is <a>Christianity</a>. Before the Protestant Reformation, the island had a long history as part of the unified <a>Catholic Church</a>, and in the years following the Reformation, the religious authorities on the island, and later the population of the island, accepted the religious authority of the British monarchy and the <a>Church of England</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> It has also come under the influence of Irish religious tradition. The island forms a separate diocese called <a>Sodor and Man</a>, which in the distant past comprised the medieval kingdom of Man and the Scottish isles ("Suðreyjar" in Old Norse). It now consists of 16 parishes,<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup> and since 1541<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup> has formed part of the <a>Province of York</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup> (These modern ecclesiastical parishes do not correspond to the island's ancient parishes mentioned in this article under "Local Government", but more closely reflect the current geographical distribution of population.)

</p>
<p>
Other Christian churches also operate on the Isle of Man. The second largest denomination is the <a>Methodist Church</a>, whose Isle of Man District is close in numbers to the Anglican diocese. There are eight Catholic parish churches, included in the <a>Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> as well as a presence of <a>Eastern Orthodox</a> Christians. Additionally there are five <a>Baptist</a> churches, four <a>Pentecostal</a> churches, the <a>Salvation Army</a>, a <a>ward</a> of <a>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>, two congregations of <a>Jehovah's Witnesses</a>, two <a>United Reformed</a> churches, as well as other Christian churches. There is a small <a>Muslim</a> community, with its own mosque in Douglas, and there is also a small <a>Jewish</a> community; see <a>history of the Jews in the Isle of Man</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup>

<p>
In Manx mythology, the island was ruled by the sea god <a>Manannán</a>, who would draw his misty cloak around the island to protect it from invaders. One of the principal folk theories about the origin of the name <i>Mann</i> is that it is named after Manannán.

</p>
<p>
In the Manx tradition of <a>folklore</a>, there are many stories of mythical creatures and characters. These include the <i><a>Buggane</a></i>, a malevolent spirit which, according to legend, blew the roof off St Trinian's Church in a fit of rage; the <i><a>Fenodyree</a></i>; the <i><a>Glashtyn</a></i>; and the <i><a>Moddey Dhoo</a></i>, a <a>ghostly black dog</a> which wandered the walls and corridors of <a>Peel Castle</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man is also said to be home to <a>fairies</a>, known locally as "the little folk" or "themselves". There is a famous <a>Fairy Bridge</a>, and it is said to be bad luck if one fails to wish the fairies good morning or afternoon when passing over it. It used to be a tradition to leave a coin on the bridge to ensure good luck. Other types of fairies are the <i>Mi'raj</i> and the <i><a>Arkan Sonney</a></i>.

</p>
<p>
An old Irish story tells how <a>Lough Neagh</a> was formed when Ireland's legendary giant <a>Fionn mac Cumhaill</a> (commonly anglicised to Finn McCool) ripped up a portion of the land and tossed it at a Scottish rival. He missed, and the chunk of earth landed in the <a>Irish Sea</a>, thus creating the island.

Peel Castle has been proposed as a possible location of the Arthurian <a>Avalon</a><sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup> or as the location of the Grail Castle, site of <a>Lancelot</a>'s encounter with the sword bridge of King <a>Maleagant</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup>

<p>
One of the most oft-repeated myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, in a barrel. However this is a 19th-century legend derived from a Scottish legend, which in turn comes from a German legend. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created with the opening of the museum.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup> However, there has been a strong tradition of herbalism and the use of charms to prevent and cure illness and disease in people and animals.<sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_125">[125]</a></sup>

<p>
The music of the Isle of Man reflects <a>Celtic</a>, Norse and other influences, including from its neighbours, <a>Scotland</a>, <a>Ireland</a>, <a>England</a> and <a>Wales</a>. A wide range of music is performed on the island, such as rock, blues, jazz and pop.

</p>
<p>
Its traditional folk music has undergone a revival since the 1970s, starting with a music festival called <i><a>Yn Chruinnaght</a></i> in <a>Ramsey</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_126">[126]</a></sup> This was part of a general revival of the Manx language and culture after the death of the last native speaker of Manx in 1974.

</p>
<p>
The Isle of Man was mentioned in the <a>Who</a> song "<a>Happy Jack</a>" as the homeland of the song's titular character, who is always in a state of ecstasy, no matter what happens to him. The song 'The Craic was 90 in the Isle of Man' by <a>Christy Moore</a> describes a lively visit during the Island's tourism heyday. The Island is also the birthplace of Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, of the <a>Bee Gees</a>; a bronze statue of the trio was unveiled on Douglas promenade in July 2021.

</p>
<h3 id="Food">Food</h3>
<p>
In the past, the basic national dish of the island was <i>spuds and herrin</i>, boiled potatoes and herring. This plain dish was supported by the subsistence farmers of the island, who <a>crofted</a> the land and fished the sea for centuries. A more recent claim for the title of national dish could be the ubiquitous chips, cheese and gravy. This dish, which is similar to <a>poutine</a>, is found in most of the island's fast-food outlets, and consists of thick cut <a>chips</a>, covered in shredded Manx <a>Cheddar cheese</a> and topped with a thick gravy.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup> However, as of the Isle of Man Food & Drink Festival 2018, <a>queenies</a> have been crowned the Manx national dish.<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Seafood has traditionally accounted for a large proportion of the local diet. Although commercial fishing has declined in recent years, local delicacies include Manx <a>kippers</a> (smoked herring) which are produced by the smokeries in Peel on the west coast of the island, albeit mainly from <a>North Sea</a> herring these days.<sup><a href="#ref_129">[129]</a></sup> The smokeries also produce other specialities including smoked salmon and bacon.

</p>
<p>
Crab, lobster and scallops are commercially fished, and the <a>queen scallop</a> (<i>queenies</i>) is regarded as a particular delicacy, with a light, sweet flavour.<sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup> Cod, <a>ling</a> and mackerel are often angled for the table, and freshwater trout and salmon can be taken from the local rivers and lakes, supported by the government fish hatchery at Cornaa on the east coast.

</p>
<p>
Cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are all commercially farmed; Manx lamb from the hill farms is a popular dish. The <a>Loaghtan</a>, the indigenous breed of Manx sheep, has a rich, dark meat that has found favour with chefs,<sup><a href="#ref_131">[131]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_132">[132]</a></sup> featuring in dishes on the BBC's <i><a>MasterChef</a></i> series.

</p>
<p>
Manx cheese has also found some success, featuring smoked and herb-flavoured varieties, and is stocked by many of the UK's supermarket chains.<sup><a href="#ref_133">[133]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_134">[134]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup> Manx cheese took bronze medals in the 2005 British Cheese Awards, and sold 578 tonnes over the year. Manx cheddar has been exported to Canada where it is available in some supermarkets.<sup><a href="#ref_136">[136]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beer is brewed on a commercial scale by <a>Okells Brewery</a>, which was established in 1850 and is the island's largest brewer; and also by <a>Bushy's Brewery</a> and the Hooded Ram Brewery. The Isle of Man's Pure Beer Act of 1874, which resembles the <a>German</a><i><a>Reinheitsgebot</a></i> , is still in effect: under this Act, brewers may only use water, malt, sugar and hops in their brews.<sup><a href="#ref_137">[137]</a></sup>

<p>
The Isle of Man is represented as a nation in the <a>Commonwealth Games</a> and the <a>Island Games</a> and hosted the IV <a>Commonwealth Youth Games</a> in 2011. Manx athletes have won <a>three gold medals</a> at the Commonwealth Games, including the one by cyclist <a>Mark Cavendish</a> in 2006 in the <a>Scratch race</a>. The <a>Island Games</a> were first held on the island in 1985, and again in 2001. In 2019, <a>FC Isle of Man</a> was founded and is a <a>North West Counties League</a> team.

<p>
Isle of Man teams and individuals participate in many sports both on and off the island including <a>rugby union</a>, <a>football</a>, <a>gymnastics</a>, <a>field hockey</a>, <a>netball</a>, <a>taekwondo</a>, <a>bowling</a>, obstacle course racing and <a>cricket</a>. It being an island, many types of watersports are also popular with residents.

</p>
<div>Further information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_TT">Isle of Man TT</a></div>
<p>
The main international event associated with the island is the <a>Isle of Man Tourist Trophy</a> race, colloquially known as "The TT",<sup><a href="#ref_138">[138]</a></sup> which began in <a>1907</a>. It takes place in late May and early June. The TT is now an international <a>road racing</a> event for motorcycles, which used to be part of the World Championship, and is long considered to be one of the "greatest motorcycle sporting events of the world".<sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup> Taking place over a two-week period, it has become a festival for motorcycling culture, makes a huge contribution to the island's economy and has become part of Manx identity.<sup><a href="#ref_140">[140]</a></sup> For many, the Isle carries the title "road racing capital of the world".<sup><a href="#ref_141">[141]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Manx Grand Prix</a> is a separate motorcycle event for amateurs and private entrants that uses the same 60.70 km (37.72 mi)<sup><a href="#ref_142">[142]</a></sup><a>Snaefell Mountain Course</a>  in late August and early September.

</p>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cammag">Cammag</a></div>
<p>
Prior to the introduction of football in the 19th century, <a>Cammag</a> was the island's traditional sport.<sup><a href="#ref_143">[143]</a></sup> It is similar to the Irish <a>hurling</a> and the Scottish game of <a>shinty</a>. Nowadays there is an annual match at <a>St John's</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Cinema">Cinema</h3>
<p>
The Isle of Man has two cinemas, both in Douglas. The Broadway Cinema is located in the government-owned and -run Villa Marina and <a>Gaiety Theatre</a> complex. It has a capacity of 154 and also doubles as a conference venue.<sup><a href="#ref_144">[144]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Palace Cinema is located next to the derelict <a>Castle Mona</a> hotel and is operated by the Sefton Group. It has two screens: Screen One holds 293 customers, while Screen Two is smaller with a capacity of just 95. It was extensively refurbished in August 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_145">[145]</a></sup>

<p>
Two domestic animals are specifically connected to the Isle of Man, though they are also found elsewhere.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Manx cat</a> is a breed of cat noted for its genetic mutation that causes it to have a shortened tail. The length of this tail can range from a few inches, known as a "stumpy", to being completely nonexistent, or "rumpy". Manx cats display a range of colours and usually have somewhat longer hind legs compared to most cats. The cats have been used as a symbol of the Isle of Man on coins and stamps and at one time the Manx government operated a breeding centre to ensure the continuation of the breed.<sup><a href="#ref_146">[146]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/Manx_loaghtan.jpg/220px-Manx_loaghtan.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The <a>Manx Loaghtan</a> sheep is a breed native to the island. It has dark brown wool and four, or sometimes six, horns. The meat is considered to be a delicacy.<sup><a href="#ref_147">[147]</a></sup> There are several flocks on the island and others have been started in England and <a>Jersey</a>.

</p>
<p>
A more recent arrival on the island is the <a>red-necked wallaby</a>, which is now established on the island following an escape from the Wildlife Park.<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup> The local police report an increasing number of wallaby-related calls.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are also many feral goats in <a>Garff</a>, a matter which was raised in Tynwald Court in January 2018.<sup><a href="#ref_150">[150]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In March 2016, the Isle of Man became the first entire territory to be adopted into UNESCO's Network of <a>Biosphere Reserves</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_151">[151]</a></sup>

<p>
The Isle of Man has a <a>temperate</a><a>oceanic climate</a>  (<a>Köppen</a><i>Cfb</i> ). Average rainfall is higher than averaged over the territory of the British Isles, because the Isle of Man is far enough from Ireland for the prevailing south-westerly winds to accumulate moisture. Average rainfall is highest at <a>Snaefell</a>, where it is around 1,900 millimetres (75 in) a year. At lower levels it can be around 800 millimetres (31 in) a year. The highest recorded temperature was 28.9 °C (84.0 °F) at <a>Ronaldsway</a> on 12 July 1983.

</p>
<p>
On 10 May 2019 Chief Minister Howard Quayle stated that the <a>Isle of Man Government</a> recognises that a <a>state of emergency</a> exists due to the threat of anthropogenic <a>climate change</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>
