<b>Madhya Pradesh</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˌ</span><span>m</span><span>ə</span><span>d</span><span>j</span><span>ə</span></span><span></span><span><span>p</span><span>r</span><span>ə</span><span>ˈ</span><span>d</span><span>ɛ</span><span>ʃ</span></span>/</a></span></span>,<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><small>Hindi: </small><span><a>[ˈməd̪ʱjə pɾəˈdeːʃ]</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span>  ; meaning <i>Central Province</i>) is a state in central <a>India</a>. Its <a>capital</a> is <a>Bhopal</a>, and the largest city is <a>Indore</a>, with <a>Jabalpur</a>, <a>Ujjain</a>, <a>Gwalior</a>, <a>Satna</a> being the other major cities. Madhya Pradesh is the <a>second largest Indian state by area</a> and the <a>fifth largest state by population</a> with over 72 million residents. It borders the states of <a>Uttar Pradesh</a> to the northeast, <a>Chhattisgarh</a> to the southeast, <a>Maharashtra</a> to the south, <a>Gujarat</a> to the west, and <a>Rajasthan</a> to the northwest.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The area covered by the present-day Madhya Pradesh includes the area of the ancient <a>Avanti</a><a>Mahajanapada</a> , whose capital Ujjain (also known as Avantika) arose as a major city during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. Subsequently, the region was ruled by the major dynasties of India. The <a>Maratha empire</a> dominated the majority of the 18th century. After the <a>Anglo-Maratha Wars</a> in the 19th century, the region was divided into several <a>princely states</a> under the <a>British</a> and incorporated into <a>Central Provinces and Berar</a> and the <a>Central India Agency</a>. After India's independence, Madhya Pradesh state was created with <a>Nagpur</a> as its capital: this state included the southern parts of the present-day Madhya Pradesh and northeastern portion of today's Maharashtra. In 1956, this state was <a>reorganised</a> and its parts were combined with the states of <a>Madhya Bharat</a>, <a>Vindhya Pradesh</a> and <a>Bhopal</a> to form the new Madhya Pradesh state, the Marathi-speaking <a>Vidarbha</a> region was removed and merged with the <a>Bombay State</a>. This state was the largest in India by area until 2000, when its southeastern Chhattisgarh region was designated a separate state.

</p>
<p>
The <a>economy of Madhya Pradesh</a> is the <a>10th-largest</a> in India, with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of <span><span><a>₹</a></span>9.17 trillion</span> (US$120 billion) and has the country's 26th highest per-capita income of <span>₹</span> 109372.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> Madhya Pradesh <a>ranks 23rd</a> among Indian states in <a>human development index</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Rich in mineral resources, Madhya Pradesh has the largest reserves of <a>diamond</a> and <a>copper</a> in India. More than 30% of its area is under forest cover. Its tourism industry has seen considerable growth, with the state topping the National Tourism Awards in 2010–11.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> In recent years, the state's GDP growth has been above the national average.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> In 2019–20, state's GSDP was recorded at 9.07.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Madhya_Pradesh">History of Madhya Pradesh</a></div>
<p>
Isolated remains of <i><a>Homo erectus</a></i> found in Hathnora in the <a>Narmada Valley</a> indicates that Madhya Pradesh might have been inhabited in the <a>Middle Pleistocene</a> era.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> Painted pottery dated to the later <a>mesolithic</a> period has been found in the <a>Bhimbetka rock shelters</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><a>Chalcolithic</a>  sites belonging to <a>Kayatha</a> culture (2100–1800 <a>BCE</a>) and <a>Malwa culture</a> (1700–1500 BCE) have been discovered in the western part of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Madhya Pradesh is also the world's ninth-most populous <a>subnational entity</a>.

</p>
<p>
The city of <a>Ujjain</a> arose as a major centre in the region, during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. It has served as the capital of the <a>Avanti kingdom</a>. Other kingdoms mentioned in ancient epics – <a>Malava</a>, <a>Karusha</a>, <a>Dasarna</a> and <a>Nishada</a> – have also been identified with parts of Madhya Pradesh.

</p>
<p>
<a>Chandragupta Maurya</a> united northern India around 320 BCE, establishing the <a>Mauryan Empire</a>, which included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. <a>Ashoka</a> the greatest of Mauryan rulers brought the region under firmer control. After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was contested among the <a>Sakas</a>, the <a>Kushanas</a>, the <a>Satavahanas</a>, and several local dynasties during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga king Bhagabhadra erected the <a>Heliodorus pillar</a> near Vidisha.

</p>
<p>
Ujjain emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the first century <a>CE</a>, located on the trade routes between the <a>Ganges</a> plain and India's <a>Arabian Sea</a> ports. The <a>Satavahana</a> dynasty of the northern <a>Deccan</a> and the Saka dynasty of the <a>Western Satraps</a> fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Satavahana</a> king <a>Gautamiputra Satakarni</a> inflicted a crushing defeat upon the <a>Saka</a> rulers and conquered parts of Malwa and Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Subsequently, the region came under the control of the <a>Gupta empire</a> in the 4th and 5th centuries, and their southern neighbours, the <a>Vakataka</a>'s. The rock-cut temples at <a>Bagh Caves</a> in the Kukshi tehsil of the Dhar district attest to the presence of the Gupta dynasty in the region, supported by the testimony of a Badwani inscription dated to the year of 487 CE.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The attacks of the <a>Hephthalites</a> or White Huns brought about the collapse of the Gupta empire, which broke up into smaller states. The king <a>Yasodharman</a> of <a>Malwa</a> defeated the Huns in 528, ending their expansion. Later, <a>Harsha</a> (c. 590–647) ruled the northern parts of the <a>state</a>. Malwa was ruled by the south Indian <a>Rashtrakuta Dynasty</a> from the late 8th century to the 10th century.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> When the south Indian Emperor <a>Govinda III</a> of the <a>Rashtrakuta dynasty</a> annexed Malwa, he set up the family of one of his subordinates there, who took the name of <a>Paramara</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Medieval period saw the rise of the <a>Rajput</a> clans, including the <a>Paramaras</a> of Malwa and the <a>Chandelas</a> of <a>Bundelkhand</a>. The Chandellas built the majestic Hindu-Jain temples at <a>Khajuraho</a>, which represent the culmination of Hindu temple architecture in Central India. The <a>Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty</a> also held sway in northern and western Madhya Pradesh at this time. It also left some monuments of architectural value in Gwalior. Southern parts of Madhya Pradesh like Malwa were several times invaded by the south Indian <a>Western Chalukya Empire</a> which imposed its rule on the Paramara kingdom of Malwa.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> The Paramara king <a>Bhoja</a> (c. 1010–1060) was a renowned <a>polymath</a>. The small Gond kingdoms emerged in the <a>Gondwana</a> and <a>Mahakoshal</a> regions of the state. Northern Madhya Pradesh was conquered by the <a>Turkic</a><a>Delhi Sultanate</a>  in the 13th century. After the collapse of the Delhi Sultanate at the end of the 14th century, independent regional kingdoms re-emerged, including the <a>Tomara</a> kingdom of <a>Gwalior</a> and the Muslim Sultanate of <a>Malwa</a>, with its capital at <a>Mandu</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Malwa Sultanate was conquered by the Sultanate of <a>Gujarat</a> in 1531. In the 1540s, most parts of the state fell to <a>Sher Shah Suri</a>, and subsequently to the Hindu king <a>Hemu</a>. Hemu, who had earlier served as the General of the Suri dynasty, operated from the <a>Gwalior Fort</a> during 1553–56 and became the ruler of Delhi as a Vikramaditya king winning 22 battles continuously from Bengal to Gujrat and defeating Akbar's forces in the <a>Battle of Delhi</a> on 7 October 1556. However, he chose Delhi as his capital after his formal Coronation and left Gwalior. After Hemu's defeat by <a>Akbar</a> at the <a>Second Battle of Panipat</a> in 1556, most of Madhya Pradesh came under the <a>Mughal</a> rule. Gondwana and Mahakoshal remained under the control of Gond kings, who acknowledged Mughal supremacy but enjoyed virtual autonomy.

</p>
<p>
The Mughal control weakened considerably after the death of Emperor <a>Aurangzeb</a> in 1707. Between 1720 and 1760, the <a>Marathas</a> took control of most of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the establishment of semi-autonomous states under the nominal control of the <a>Peshwa</a> of <a>Pune</a>: the <a>Holkars</a> of <a>Indore</a> ruled much of Malwa, <a>Pawars</a> ruled <a>Dewas</a> and <a>Dhar</a>, the <a>Bhonsles</a> of <a>Nagpur</a> dominated Mahakoshal-Gondwana area, while the <a>Scindias</a> of <a>Gwalior</a> controlled the northern parts of the state. The most notable Maratha rulers of the region were <a>Mahadji Shinde</a>, <a>Ahilyabai Holkar</a> and <a>Yashwantrao Holkar</a>. Besides these, there were several other <a>small states</a>, including <a>Bhopal</a>, <a>Orchha</a>, and <a>Rewa</a>. The Bhopal state, which paid tribute to both the Marathas and the <a>Nizam of Hyderabad</a>, was founded by <a>Dost Mohammed Khan</a>, a former General in the Mughal army.

</p>
<p>
After the <a>Third Anglo-Maratha War</a>, the <a>British</a> took control of the entire region. All the sovereign states in the region became <a>princely states</a> of <a>British India</a>, governed by the <a>Central India Agency</a>. The Mahakoshal region became a British province: the <a>Saugor and Nerbudda Territories</a>. In 1861, the British merged the <a>Nagpur Province</a> with the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories to form the <a>Central Provinces</a>.

</p>
<p>
During the <a>1857 uprising</a>, rebellions happened in the northern parts of the state, led by leaders like <a>Tatya Tope</a>. However, these were crushed by the British and the princes loyal to them. The state witnessed a number of anti-British activities and protests during the <a>Indian independence movement</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> Several notable leaders such as <a>Chandra Shekhar Azad</a>, <a>B. R. Ambedkar</a>, <a>Shankar Dayal Sharma</a>, <a>Atal Bihari Vajpayee</a> and <a>Arjun Singh</a> were born in what is now Madhya Pradesh.

</p>
<p>
After the independence of India, Madhya Pradesh was created in 1950 from the former British <a>Central Provinces and Berar</a> and the <a>princely states</a> of <a>Makrai</a> and Chhattisgarh, with <a>Nagpur</a> as the capital of the state. The new states of <a>Madhya Bharat</a>, <a>Vindhya Pradesh</a>, and <a>Bhopal</a> were formed out of the Central India Agency. In 1956, the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh, and the <a>Marathi</a>-speaking southern region <a>Vidarbha</a>, which included Nagpur, was ceded to <a>Bombay state</a>. <a>Jabalpur</a> was chosen to be the capital of the state but at the last moment, due to political interference, <a>Bhopal</a> was made the state capital.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> In November 2000, as part of the Madhya Pradesh Reorganization Act, the southeastern portion of the state split off to form the new state of <a>Chhattisgarh</a>.

<h3 id="Location_in%20India">Location in India</h3>
<p>
Madhya Pradesh literally means "Central Province", and is located in the geographic heart of India in between the latitude of 21.6°N–26.30°N and longitude of 74°9'E–82°48'E. The state straddles the <a>Narmada River</a>, which runs east and west between the <a>Vindhya</a> and <a>Satpura</a> ranges; these ranges and the Narmada are the traditional boundaries between the north and south of India. The highest point in Madhya Pradesh is <a>Dhupgarh</a>, with an elevation of 1,350 m (4,429 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state is bordered on the west by <a>Gujarat</a>, on the northwest by <a>Rajasthan</a>, on the northeast by <a>Uttar Pradesh</a>, on the east by <a>Chhattisgarh</a>, and on the south by <a>Maharashtra</a>.

<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<p>
Madhya Pradesh also has three major seasons – Summer, Monsoon, and Winter. During summer (March–June), the temperature in the entire state ranges above 29.4°C. In general, the eastern parts of Madhya Pradesh are hotter than the western parts. The regions like Gwalior, Morena and Datia record temperature of over 42°C in the month of May. The humidity is relatively very low and the region usually experiences frequent mild dust storms. The south-west Monsoon usually breaks out in mid June and the entire state receive a major share of its rainfall between June and September. The south and south-east regions tend to experience a higher rainfall whereas the parts of north-west receive less. Mandla, Balaghat, Sidhi, Jabalpur and other extreme eastern parts receive more than 150 cm rainfall. The districts of western Madhya Pradesh receive less than 80 cm rainfall.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The winter season starts from the month of November. The temperature remains low in the northern parts of the state in comparison to the southern parts. The daily maximum temperature in most of the northern part in the month of January remains between 15 and 18°C. The climate is generally dry and pleasant with a clear sky. The average rainfall is about 1,194 mm (47.0 in). The southeastern districts have the heaviest rainfall, some places receiving as much as 2,150 mm (84.6 in), while the western and northwestern districts receive 1,000 mm (39.4 in) or less.

</p>
<h3 id="Ecology">Ecology</h3>
<p>
According to the 2011 figures, the recorded forest area of the state is 94,689 km<sup>2</sup> (36,560 sq mi) constituting 30.7% of the geographical area of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> It constitutes 12.3% of the forest area of India. Legally this area has been classified into "Reserved Forest" (65.3%), "Protected Forest" (32.8%) and "Unclassified Forest" (0.2%). Per capita forest area is 2,400 m<sup>2</sup> (0.59 acres) as against the national average of 700 m<sup>2</sup> (0.17 acres). The forest cover is less dense in the northern and western parts of the state, which contain the major urban centres. Variability in climatic and <a>edaphic</a> conditions brings about significant difference in the forest types of the state. In January 2019 1.5 million volunteers in the state planted 66 million trees in 12 hours along the <a>Narmada river</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Narmada</a> is the longest river in Madhya Pradesh. It flows westward through a rift valley, with the Vindhya ranges sprawling along its northern bank and the Satpura range of mountains along the southern. Its tributaries include the Banjar, the <a>Tawa</a>, the <a>Machna</a>, the <a>Shakkar</a>, the <a>Denwa</a> and the <a>Sonbhadra</a> rivers. The <a>Tapti River</a> runs parallel to Narmada, and also flows through a rift valley. The Narmada–Tapti systems carry an enormous volume of water and provide drainage for almost a quarter of the land area of Madhya Pradesh. The Narmada river is considered very sacred and is worshipped throughout the region. It is the main source of water and acts as a lifeline to the state.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Vindhyas</a> form the southern boundary of the Ganges basin, with the western part of the Ganges basin draining into the <a>Yamuna</a> and the eastern part directly into the Ganges itself. All the rivers, which drain into the Ganges, flow from south to north, with the <a>Chambal</a>, <a>Shipra</a>, <a>Kali Sindh</a>, <a>Parbati</a>, <a>Kuno</a>, <a>Sind</a>, <a>Betwa</a>, <a>Dhasan</a> and <a>Ken</a> rivers being the main tributaries of the Yamuna. Shipra River is one of the most sacred rivers of Hinduism. It is the site of the <a>Simhastha Kumbh Mela</a>, which is held every 12 years. The land drained by these rivers is agriculturally rich, with the natural vegetation largely consisting of grass and <a>dry deciduous forest</a> types, largely thorny. The eastern part of the Ganges basin consists of the <a>Son</a>, the <a>Tons</a> and the <a>Rihand</a> Rivers. Son, which arises in the Maikal hills around <a>Amarkantak</a>, is the largest tributary that goes into the Ganges on the south bank and that does not arise from the <a>Himalayas</a>. Son and its tributaries contribute the bulk of the monsoon flow into the Ganges, because the north bank tributaries are all snow fed. The forests in their basins are much richer than the thorn forests of the northwestern part of Madhya Pradesh.

</p>
<p>
After the formation of Chhattisgarh State, the major portion of <a>Mahanadi</a> basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only 154 km<sup>2</sup> basin area of Hasdeo River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Satpuras</a>, in the <a>Gawilgarh</a> and <a>Mahadeo Hills</a>, also contain a watershed, which is south facing. The <a>Wainganga</a>, the <a>Wardha</a>, the Pench, the <a>Kanhan</a> rivers, discharge an enormous volume of water into the <a>Godavari river</a> system. The Godavari basin consists of <a>sub-tropical</a>, semi-moist forests, mainly in the valley of the Indrawati. There are many important multi-state irrigation projects in development, including the <a>Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects</a>.

<h3 id="Languages">Languages</h3>
<p>
The official language of the state is <a>Hindi</a>, which is spoken by over two-thirds of the population and is used for all government business.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> In urban areas Standard Hindi is the main language, while <a>Urdu</a> is spoken by Muslims. In rural areas however, most speak varieties counted as dialects of Hindi in the census, although most are quite distinct. In the west are <a>Malvi</a> and <a>Nimadi</a> in the <a>Malwa</a> and <a>Nimar</a> regions, which are more closely related to the <a>Rajasthani languages</a>. In <a>Bundelkhand</a> in the north and <a>Baghelkhand</a> in the east are spoken <a>Bundeli</a> and <a>Bagheli</a> which are eastern varieties of the Hindi languages, similar to <a>Awadhi</a> or <a>Chhattisgarhi</a>. In the southeast is spoken Chhattisgarhi and <a>Powari</a> is the language of the far south, both Eastern Hindi languages. Most speakers of these languages consider them to be dialects of Hindi and so report their language as 'Hindi' on the census.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Marathi</a> is another significant language. Due to <a>Maratha</a> rule over much of what is now Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh is home to the largest number of Marathis outside Maharashtra. Although large numbers of Marathis can be found in urban centres like Indore, the highest concentrations are in the southern areas of the state adjoining Maharashtra. Marathi is the most-spoken language in Burhanpur district, while it is a major minority language in the southern parts of Mahakoshal especially Betul, Chhindwara and Balaghat districts.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are several languages spoken by the Adivasis. The various <a>Bhil languages</a> are Indo-Aryan languages spoken by 50 lakh Bhils of western Madhya Pradesh. Although many, especially in the eastern parts of their range, have adopted the regional languages as mother tongue, the languages are still strong in the far-western hills especially Barwani, Jhabua and Alirajpur districts where they are in the majority. <a>Bhili</a>, the <a>Bareli languages</a> and <a>Bhilali</a> are the major varieties spoken in the state.

</p>
<p>
<a>Gondi</a> is the second-largest Adivasi language, spoken by 11 lakh Gonds in the state. A <a>Dravidian language</a> related to <a>Telugu</a>, it is mainly spoken in the southern Satpura highlands of Mahakoshal, where it is spoken with the regional languages. Some in the remoter valleys of the Satpuras speak a poorly-described Dravidian dialect called <a>Bharia</a>. Smaller minorities of Gondi speakers can be found in Khandwa and Dewas districts in the west as well as Anuppur, Sidhi and Singrauli districts in the east. Elsewhere in the state, the Gonds have almost totally abandoned their original language.

</p>
<p>
<a>Korku</a>, a <a>Munda language</a>, has over 4 lakh speakers in the central highlands of the state. In the far-southeast of Burhanpur can be found some speakers of the language isolate <a>Nihali</a> who live among the Korku. All speakers of tribal languages face significant pressure to switch to the dominant regional languages while their own tongues are considered 'backward' and 'rural'.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The following languages are taught in schools in Madhya Pradesh under the Three Language Formula:<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
First language: Any <a>Scheduled Language</a>
</p>
<p>
Second language: Hindi, Urdu or English

</p>
<p>
Third language: Another Scheduled Language, <a>Arabic</a>, <a>Persian</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>Russian</a>
</p>
<h3 id="Religion">Religion</h3>
<p>

Hinduism is the main religion and is followed by 90.9% of the population.
</p>
<p>
According to the census of 2011, 90.9% of residents followed <a>Hinduism</a>, while minorities are <a>Muslim</a> (6.6%), <a>Jain</a> (0.8%), <a>Buddhists</a> (0.3%), Christians (0.3%), and <a>Sikhs</a> (0.2%). Madhya Pradesh is home to several pilgrimage sites including <a>Amarkantak</a> at the source of the Narmada and the Ghats of <a>Omkareshwar</a>, also on the Narmada. Temples can be found throughout the state. Buddhism and Jainism were once prominent religions in the state, especially in the central plateau near Raisen and Bhopal. Malwa is still home to a significant Jain minority. Jains are particularly concentrated in the urban centres of the Malwa region. Islam arrived with Muslim rule in the 14th century, although its influence was and is limited to major urban centres. Islam is a major religion in Bhopal and Burhanpur, and Bhopal is home to many prominent Islamic shrines. Buddhism in modern times is mainly practiced by Marathis in the south. Most respondents who answered 'Other' self-identified as following Adivasi religions such as Koya Punem of the Gonds.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
