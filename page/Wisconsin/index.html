<b>Wisconsin</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>w</span><span>ɪ</span><span>ˈ</span><span>s</span><span>k</span><span>ɒ</span><span>n</span><span>s</span><span>ɪ</span><span>n</span></span>/</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span></span>) is a <a>state</a> in the <a>upper</a><a>Midwestern United States</a> , bordered by <a>Minnesota</a> to the west, <a>Iowa</a> to the southwest, <a>Illinois</a> to the south, <a>Lake Michigan</a> to the east, <a>Michigan</a> to the northeast, and <a>Lake Superior</a> to the north. Wisconsin is the <a>25th-largest state by total area</a> and the <a>20th-most populous</a>.

</p>
<p>
Three of its largest cities are situated on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, these include the largest, <a>Milwaukee</a>, as well as <a>Green Bay</a> and <a>Kenosha</a>, the third and fourth most populated Wisconsin cities respectively. The state capital, <a>Madison</a>, is currently the second most populated and fastest growing city in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Wisconsin is divided into <a>72 counties</a> and as of the <a>2020 census</a> had a population of nearly 5.9 million.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Wisconsin's geography</a> is diverse, having been greatly impacted by glaciers during the <a>Ice Age</a> with the exception of the <a>Driftless Area</a>. The <a>Northern Highland</a> and <a>Western Upland</a> along with a part of the <a>Central Plain</a> occupies the western part of the state, with lowlands stretching to the shore of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin is third to <a>Ontario</a> and Michigan in the length of its <a>Great Lakes</a> coastline. The northern portion of the state is home to the <a>Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest</a>.

</p>
<p>
At the time of European contact the area was inhabited by <a>Algonquian</a> and <a>Siouan</a> nations, and today is home to <a>eleven</a> federally recognized <a>tribes</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> During the 19th and early 20th centuries many European settlers entered the state, most of whom emigrated from Germany<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> and <a>Scandinavia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> Wisconsin remains a center of <a>German American</a> and <a>Scandinavian American</a> culture,<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> particularly in respect to its <a>cuisine</a>, with foods such as <a>bratwurst</a> and <a>Kringle</a>. 

</p>
<p>
The state is one of the nation's leading <a>dairy producers</a> and is known as "America's Dairyland"; it is particularly famous for <a>its cheese</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> The state is also famous for <a>its beer</a>, particularly and historically <a>in Milwaukee</a>, most notably as the headquarters of the <a>Miller Brewing Company</a>.

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
The word <i>Wisconsin</i> originates from the name given to the <a>Wisconsin River</a> by one of the <a>Algonquian</a>-speaking <a>Native American</a> groups living in the region at the time of <a>European contact</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> French explorer <a>Jacques Marquette</a> was the first <a>European</a> to reach the <a>Wisconsin River</a>, arriving in 1673 and calling the river <i>Meskousing</i> (likely ᒣᔅᑯᐤᓯᣙ <i>meskowsin</i>) in his journal.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> Subsequent <a>French</a> writers changed the spelling from <i>Meskousing</i> to <i>Ouisconsin</i>, and over time this became the name for both the Wisconsin River and the surrounding lands. English speakers <a>anglicized</a> the spelling from <i>Ouisconsin</i> to <i>Wisconsin</i> when they began to arrive in large numbers during the early 19th century. The legislature of <a>Wisconsin Territory</a> made the current spelling official in 1845.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Algonquian</a> word for Wisconsin and its original meaning have both grown obscure. While interpretations vary, most implicate the river and the red sandstone that lines its banks. One leading theory holds that the name originated from the <a>Miami</a> word <i>Meskonsing</i>, meaning "it lies red", a reference to the setting of the Wisconsin River as it flows through the reddish sandstone of the <a>Wisconsin Dells</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> Other theories include claims that the name originated from one of a variety of <a>Ojibwa</a> words meaning "red stone place", "where the waters gather", or "great rock".<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>

<p>
Wisconsin has been home to a wide variety of cultures over the past 14,000 years. The first people arrived around 10,000 BCE during the <a>Wisconsin Glaciation</a>. These early inhabitants, called <a>Paleo-Indians</a>, hunted now-extinct <a>ice age animals</a> such as the <a>Boaz mastodon</a>, a prehistoric <a>mastodon</a> skeleton unearthed along with spear points in southwest Wisconsin.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> After the ice age ended around 8000 BCE, people in the subsequent <a>Archaic period</a> lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering food from wild plants. Agricultural societies emerged gradually over the <a>Woodland period</a> between 1000 BCE to 1000 CE. Toward the end of this period, Wisconsin was the heartland of the "<a>Effigy Mound</a> culture", which built thousands of animal-shaped mounds across the landscape.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> Later, between 1000 and 1500 CE, the <a>Mississippian</a> and <a>Oneota</a> cultures built substantial settlements including the fortified village at <a>Aztalan</a> in southeast Wisconsin.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> The Oneota may be the ancestors of the modern <a>Ioway</a> and <a>Ho-Chunk</a> nations who shared the Wisconsin region with the <a>Menominee</a> at the time of European contact.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> Other Native American groups living in Wisconsin when Europeans first settled included the <a>Ojibwa</a>, <a>Sauk</a>, <a>Fox</a>, <a>Kickapoo</a>, and <a>Pottawatomie</a>, who migrated to Wisconsin from the east between 1500 and 1700.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>

<p>
The first European to visit what became Wisconsin was probably the French explorer <a>Jean Nicolet</a>. He canoed west from <a>Georgian Bay</a> through the <a>Great Lakes</a> in 1634, and it is traditionally assumed that he came ashore near <a>Green Bay</a> at <a>Red Banks</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup><a>Pierre Radisson</a>  and <a>Médard des Groseilliers</a> visited Green Bay again in 1654–1666 and <a>Chequamegon Bay</a> in 1659–1660, where they traded for fur with local Native Americans.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> In 1673, Jacques Marquette and <a>Louis Jolliet</a> became the first to record a journey on the <a>Fox-Wisconsin Waterway</a> all the way to the <a>Mississippi River</a> near <a>Prairie du Chien</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup><a>Frenchmen</a>  like <a>Nicholas Perrot</a> continued to ply the <a>fur trade</a> across Wisconsin through the 17th and 18th centuries, but the French made no permanent settlements in Wisconsin before <a>Great Britain</a> won control of the region following the <a>French and Indian War</a> in 1763. Even so, French traders continued to work in the region after the war, and some, beginning with <a>Charles de Langlade</a> in 1764, settled in Wisconsin permanently, rather than returning to British-controlled <a>Canada</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>

<p>
The British gradually took over Wisconsin during the <a>French and Indian War</a>, taking control of Green Bay in 1761 and gaining control of all of Wisconsin in 1763. Like the French, the British were interested in little but the fur trade. One notable event in the fur trading industry in Wisconsin occurred in 1791, when two free African Americans set up a fur trading post among the Menominee at present day <a>Marinette</a>. The first permanent settlers, mostly <a>French Canadians</a>, some Anglo-<a>New Englanders</a> and a few <a>African American</a> freedmen, arrived in Wisconsin while it was under British control. <a>Charles Michel de Langlade</a> is generally recognized as the first settler, establishing a trading post at Green Bay in 1745, and moving there permanently in 1764.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> Settlement began at <a>Prairie du Chien</a> around 1781. The French residents at the trading post in what is now Green Bay, referred to the town as "La Baye".  However, British fur traders referred to it as "Green Bay", because the water and the shore assumed green tints in early spring. The old French title was gradually dropped, and the British name of "Green Bay" eventually stuck. The region coming under British rule had virtually no adverse effect on the French residents as the British needed the cooperation of the French fur traders and the French fur traders needed the goodwill of the British. During the French occupation of the region licenses for fur trading had been issued scarcely and only to select groups of traders, whereas the British, in an effort to make as much money as possible from the region, issued licenses for fur trading freely, both to British and to French residents. The fur trade in what is now Wisconsin reached its height under British rule, and the first self-sustaining farms in the state were established as well. From 1763 to 1780, Green Bay was a prosperous community which produced its own foodstuff, built graceful cottages and held dances and festivities.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>

<p>
Wisconsin became a territorial possession of the United States in 1783 after the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>. In 1787, it became part of the <a>Northwest Territory</a>. As territorial boundaries subsequently developed, it was then part of <a>Indiana Territory</a> from 1800 to 1809, <a>Illinois Territory</a> from 1809 to 1818, and <a>Michigan Territory</a> from 1818 to 1836. However, the British remained in control until after the <a>War of 1812</a>, the outcome of which finally established an American presence in the area.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> Under American control, the economy of the territory shifted from fur trading to lead mining. The prospect of easy mineral wealth drew <a>immigrants</a> from throughout the U.S. and Europe to the lead deposits located at <a>Mineral Point</a>, <a>Dodgeville</a>, and nearby areas. Some miners found shelter in the holes they had dug, and earned the nickname "badgers", leading to Wisconsin's identity as the "Badger State".<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> The sudden influx of white miners prompted tension with the local Native American population. The <a>Winnebago War</a> of 1827 and the <a>Black Hawk War</a> of 1832 culminated in the forced <a>removal of Native Americans</a> from most parts of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Following these conflicts, <a>Wisconsin Territory</a> was created by an act of the <a>United States Congress</a> on April 20, 1836. By fall of that year, the best prairie groves of the counties surrounding what is now Milwaukee were occupied by farmers from the <a>New England</a> states.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Erie Canal</a> facilitated the travel of both <a>Yankee</a> settlers and European immigrants to Wisconsin Territory. Yankees from <a>New England</a> and <a>upstate New York</a> seized a dominant position in law and politics, enacting policies that marginalized the region's earlier Native American and French-Canadian residents.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Yankees also speculated in real estate, platted towns such as Racine, Beloit, Burlington, and Janesville, and established schools, civic institutions, and <a>Congregationalist</a> churches.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> At the same time, many <a>Germans</a>, <a>Irish</a>, <a>Norwegians</a>, and other immigrants also settled in towns and farms across the territory, establishing <a>Catholic</a> and <a>Lutheran</a> institutions.

</p>
<p>
The growing population allowed Wisconsin to gain statehood on May 29, 1848, as the 30th state. Between 1840 and 1850, Wisconsin's non-Indian population had swollen from 31,000 to 305,000. More than a third of residents (110,500) were foreign born, including 38,000 Germans, 28,000 British immigrants from England, Scotland, and Wales, and 21,000 Irish. Another third (103,000) were <a>Yankees</a> from New England and western New York state. Only about 63,000 residents in 1850 had been born in Wisconsin.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Nelson Dewey</a>, the first <a>governor of Wisconsin</a>, was a <a>Democrat</a>. Dewey oversaw the transition from the territorial to the new state government.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> He encouraged the development of the state's infrastructure, particularly the construction of new roads, railroads, canals, and harbors, as well as the improvement of the <a>Fox</a> and <a>Wisconsin Rivers</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> During his administration, the <a>State Board of Public Works</a> was organized.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> Dewey, an <a>abolitionist</a>, was the first of many Wisconsin governors to advocate against the spread of <a>slavery</a> into new states and territories.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>

<p>
Politics in early Wisconsin were defined by the greater national debate over <a>slavery</a>. A free state from its foundation, Wisconsin became a center of northern <a>abolitionism</a>. The debate became especially intense in 1854 after <a>Joshua Glover</a>, a runaway slave from <a>Missouri</a>, was captured in <a>Racine</a>. Glover was taken into custody under the Federal <a>Fugitive Slave Law</a>, but a mob of abolitionists stormed the prison where Glover was held and helped him escape to Canada. In a trial stemming from the incident, the <a>Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> ultimately declared the Fugitive Slave Law unconstitutional.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> The <a>Republican Party</a>, founded on March 20, 1854, by anti-slavery expansion activists in <a>Ripon, Wisconsin</a>, grew to dominate state politics in the aftermath of these events.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> During the <a>Civil War</a>, around 91,000 troops from Wisconsin fought for the <a>Union</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>

<p>
Wisconsin's economy also diversified during the early years of statehood. While lead mining diminished, agriculture became a principal occupation in the southern half of the state. Railroads were built across the state to help transport grains to market, and industries like <a>J.I. Case & Company</a> in Racine were founded to build agricultural equipment. Wisconsin briefly became one of the nation's leading producers of wheat during the 1860s.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> Meanwhile, the lumber industry dominated in the heavily forested northern sections of Wisconsin, and sawmills sprang up in cities like <a>La Crosse</a>, <a>Eau Claire</a>, and <a>Wausau</a>. These economic activities had dire environmental consequences. By the close of the 19th century, intensive agriculture had devastated soil fertility, and lumbering had deforested most of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> These conditions forced both wheat agriculture and the lumber industry into a precipitous decline.

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Chase_Stone_Barn_-_Green_Grass.jpg/220px-Chase_Stone_Barn_-_Green_Grass.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Beginning in the 1890s, farmers in Wisconsin shifted from wheat to dairy production in order to make more sustainable and profitable use of their land. Many immigrants carried cheese-making traditions that, combined with the state's suitable geography and dairy research led by <a>Stephen Babcock</a> at the <a>University of Wisconsin</a>, helped the state build a reputation as "America's Dairyland".<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> Meanwhile, conservationists including <a>Aldo Leopold</a> helped re-establish the state's forests during the early 20th century,<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> paving the way for a more renewable lumber and <a>paper milling</a> industry as well as promoting recreational tourism in the northern woodlands. Manufacturing also boomed in Wisconsin during the early 20th century, driven by an immense immigrant workforce arriving from Europe. Industries in cities like Milwaukee ranged from brewing and food processing to heavy machine production and tool-making, leading Wisconsin to rank 8th among U.S. states in total product value by 1910.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>

<p>
The early 20th century was also notable for the emergence of <a>progressive</a> politics championed by <a>Robert M. La Follette</a>. Between 1901 and 1914, Progressive Republicans in Wisconsin created the nation's first comprehensive statewide <a>primary election</a> system,<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> the first effective <a>workplace injury compensation</a> law,<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> and the first state <a>income tax</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> making taxation proportional to actual earnings. The progressive <a>Wisconsin Idea</a> also promoted the statewide expansion of the University of Wisconsin through the <a>UW-Extension</a> system at this time.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> Later, UW economics professors <a>John R. Commons</a> and Harold Groves helped Wisconsin create the first <a>unemployment compensation</a> program in the United States in 1932.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the immediate aftermath of World War II, citizens of Wisconsin were divided over issues such as creation of the <a>United Nations</a>, support for the European recovery, and the growth of the Soviet Union's power. However, when Europe divided into Communist and capitalist camps and the Communist revolution in China succeeded in 1949, public opinion began to move towards support for the protection of democracy and capitalism against Communist expansion.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wisconsin took part in several political extremes in the mid to late 20th century, ranging from the <a>anti-communist</a> crusades of Senator <a>Joseph McCarthy</a> in the 1950s to the radical antiwar protests at UW-Madison that culminated in the <a>Sterling Hall bombing</a> in August 1970. The state undertook <a>welfare reform</a> under Republican Governor <a>Tommy Thompson</a> during the 1990s.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> The state's economy also underwent further transformations towards the close of the 20th century, as heavy industry and manufacturing declined in favor of a <a>service economy</a> based on medicine, education, agribusiness, and tourism.

</p>
<p>
Two U.S. Navy battleships, <a>BB-9</a> and <a>BB-64</a>, were named for the state.

In 2011, Wisconsin became the focus of some controversy when newly elected governor <a>Scott Walker</a> proposed, passed, and enacted the <a>2011 Wisconsin Act 10</a>, which made large changes in the areas of collective bargaining, compensation, retirement, health insurance, and sick leave of public sector employees, among other changes.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> A <a>series of major protests</a> by union supporters took place that year in response to the changes, and Walker survived <a>a recall election held the next year</a>, becoming the first governor in United States history to do so.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> Walker enacted other bills promoting conservative governance, such as a <a>right-to-work law</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> abortion restrictions,<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> and legislation removing certain gun controls.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup>

Wisconsin is bordered by the <a>Montreal River</a>; <a>Lake Superior</a> and <a>Michigan</a> to the north; by <a>Lake Michigan</a> to the east; by <a>Illinois</a> to the south; and by <a>Iowa</a> to the southwest and <a>Minnesota</a> to the northwest. A border dispute with <a>Michigan</a> was settled by two cases, both <a>Wisconsin v. Michigan</a>, in 1934 and 1935. The state's boundaries include the <a>Mississippi River</a> and <a>St. Croix River</a> in the west, and the <a>Menominee River</a> in the northeast.

</p>
<p>
With its location between the <a>Great Lakes</a> and the Mississippi River, Wisconsin is home to a wide variety of geographical features. The state is divided into five distinct regions. In the north, the <a>Lake Superior Lowland</a> occupies a belt of land along Lake Superior. Just to the south, the <a>Northern Highland</a> has massive mixed hardwood and coniferous forests including the 1,500,000 acres (6,100 km<sup>2</sup>) <a>Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest</a>, as well as thousands of glacial lakes, and the state's highest point, <a>Timms Hill</a>. In the middle of the state, the <a>Central Plain</a> has some unique <a>sandstone</a> formations like the <a>Dells of the Wisconsin River</a> in addition to rich farmland. The <a>Eastern Ridges and Lowlands</a> region in the southeast is home to many of Wisconsin's largest cities. The ridges include the <a>Niagara Escarpment</a> that stretches from <a>New York</a>, the <a>Black River Escarpment</a> and the <a>Magnesian Escarpment</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the southwest, the <a>Western Upland</a> is a rugged landscape with a mix of forest and farmland, including many bluffs on the <a>Mississippi River</a>. This region is part of the <a>Driftless Area</a>, which also includes portions of <a>Iowa</a>, <a>Illinois</a>, and <a>Minnesota</a>. This area was not covered by <a>glaciers</a> during the most recent ice age, the <a>Wisconsin Glaciation</a>. Overall, 46% of Wisconsin's land area is covered by forest. <a>Langlade County</a> has a soil rarely found outside of the county called <a>Antigo silt loam</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wisconsin has sister-state relationships with Germany's <a>Hesse</a>, Japan's <a>Chiba Prefecture</a>, Mexico's <a>Jalisco</a>, China's <a>Heilongjiang</a>, and <a>Nicaragua</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>

<p>
Most of Wisconsin is classified as warm-summer <a>humid continental climate</a> (<a>Köppen</a><i>Dfb</i> ), while southern and southwestern portions are classified as hot-summer <a>humid continental climate</a> (Köppen <i>Dfa</i>). The highest temperature ever recorded in the state was in the Wisconsin Dells, on July 13, 1936, where it reached 114 °F (46 °C). The lowest temperature ever recorded in Wisconsin was in the village of <a>Couderay</a>, where it reached −55 °F (−48 °C) on both February 2 and 4, 1996. Wisconsin also receives a large amount of regular snowfall averaging around 40 inches (100 cm) in the southern portions with up to 160 inches (410 cm) annually in the Lake Superior <a>snowbelt</a> each year.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of Wisconsin was 5,822,434 on July 1, 2019, a 2.4% increase since the <a>2010 United States census</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup> This includes a natural increase since the last census of 150,659 people (i.e., 614,771 births minus 464,112 deaths) and an decrease due to net migration of 12,755 people. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 59,251 people, and migration from within the U.S. resulted in a net decrease of 72,006 people.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The table below shows the racial composition of Wisconsin's population as of 2020.

</p>
<p>
According to the 2016 <a>American Community Survey</a>, 6.5% of Wisconsin's population were of <a>Hispanic or Latino</a> origin (of any race): <a>Mexican</a> (4.7%), <a>Puerto Rican</a> (0.9%), <a>Cuban</a> (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (0.7%).<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup> The five largest ancestry groups were: <a>German</a> (40.5%), <a>Irish</a> (10.8%), <a>Polish</a> (8.8%), <a>Norwegian</a> (7.7%), and <a>English</a> (5.7%).<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> German is the most common ancestry in every county in the state, except Menominee, Trempealeau, and Vernon.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> Wisconsin has the highest percentage of residents of Polish ancestry of any state.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Since its founding, Wisconsin has been ethnically heterogeneous. Following the period of French fur traders, the next wave of settlers were miners, many of whom were <a>Cornish</a>, who settled the southwestern area of the state. The next wave was dominated by "Yankees", migrants of <a>English descent</a> from <a>New England</a> and <a>upstate New York</a>; in the early years of statehood, they dominated the state's heavy industry, finance, politics, and education. Between 1850 and 1900, the immigrants were mostly <a>Germans</a>, <a>Scandinavians</a> (the largest group being <a>Norwegian</a>), <a>Irish</a>, and <a>Poles</a>. In the 20th century, a number of <a>African Americans</a> and <a>Mexicans</a> settled in <a>Milwaukee</a>; and after the end of the <a>Vietnam War</a> came an influx of <a>Hmongs</a>.

</p>
<p>
The various ethnic groups settled in different areas of the state. Although German immigrants settled throughout the state, the largest concentration was in Milwaukee. Norwegian immigrants settled in lumbering and farming areas in the north and west. Irish, Italian, and Polish immigrants settled primarily in urban areas.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup><a>Menominee County</a>  is the only county in the eastern United States with a Native American majority.

</p>
<p>
African Americans came to Milwaukee, especially from 1940 on. 86% of Wisconsin's African-American population live in four cities: <a>Milwaukee</a>, <a>Racine</a>, <a>Beloit</a>, <a>Kenosha</a>, with Milwaukee home to nearly three-fourths of the state's black Americans. In the <a>Great Lakes</a> region, only Detroit and <a>Cleveland</a> have a higher percentage of African-American residents.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
33% of Wisconsin's Asian population is <a>Hmong</a>, with significant communities in <a>Milwaukee</a>, <a>Wausau</a>, <a>Green Bay</a>, <a>Sheboygan</a>, <a>Appleton</a>, <a>Madison</a>, <a>La Crosse</a>, <a>Eau Claire</a>, <a>Oshkosh</a>, and <a>Manitowoc</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Of the residents of Wisconsin, 71.7% were born in Wisconsin, 23.0% were born in a different US state, 0.7% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 4.6% were foreign born.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

<p>
Wisconsin's court system has four levels: municipal courts, circuit courts, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. Municipal courts typically handle cases involving <a>local ordinance</a> matters. The <a>circuit courts</a> are Wisconsin's <a>trial courts</a>, they have <a>original jurisdiction</a> in all civil and criminal cases within the state. Challenges to circuit court rulings are heard by the <a>Wisconsin Court of Appeals</a>, consisting of sixteen judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. As the state's highest appellate court, the <a>Wisconsin Supreme Court</a> may hear both appeals from lower courts and original actions. In addition to deciding cases, the <a>Supreme Court</a> is responsible for administering the state's court system and regulating the practice of law in Wisconsin.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup>

<p>
Wisconsin collects personal <a>income taxes</a> (based on five <a>income brackets</a>) which range from 4% to 7.65%. The state <a>sales</a> and <a>use tax</a> rate is 5.0%. Fifty-nine counties have an additional sales/use tax of 0.5%.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup><a>Milwaukee County</a>  and four surrounding counties have an additional temporary 0.1% tax that helps fund the <a>Miller Park</a> baseball stadium, which was completed in 2001.

</p>
<p>
The most common property tax assessed on Wisconsin residents is the real <a>property tax</a>, or their residential property tax. Wisconsin does not impose a property tax on vehicles, but does levy an annual registration fee. Property taxes are the most important tax revenue source for Wisconsin's local governments, as well as major methods of funding school districts, vocational technical colleges, special purpose districts and tax incremental finance districts. Equalized values are based on the full market value of all taxable property in the state, except for agricultural land. In order to provide property tax relief for farmers, the value of agricultural land is determined by its value for agricultural uses, rather than for its possible development value. Equalized values are used to distribute state aid payments to counties, municipalities, and technical colleges. Assessments prepared by local assessors are used to distribute the property tax burden within individual municipalities.

</p>
<p>
Wisconsin does not assess a tax on <a>intangible property</a>. Wisconsin does not collect <a>inheritance taxes</a>. Until January 1, 2008, Wisconsin's <a>estate tax</a> was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws; therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are no <a>toll roads</a> in Wisconsin; highway construction and maintenance are funded in part by <a>motor fuel tax</a> revenues, and the remaining balance is drawn from the State General Fund. Non-highway road construction and maintenance are funded by local governments (municipalities or <a>counties</a>).

During the <a>Civil War</a>, Wisconsin was a <a>Republican</a> state; in fact it is the state that gave birth to the Republican Party, although ethno-religious issues in the late 19th century caused a brief split in the coalition. The <a>Bennett Law</a> campaign of 1890 dealt with foreign language teaching in schools. Many Germans switched to the <a>Democratic Party</a> because of the <a>Republican Party's</a> support of the law.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wisconsin's political history encompasses, on the one hand, <a>"Fighting Bob" La Follette</a> and the <a>Progressive movement</a>; and on the other, the Republican and anti-Communist <a>Joe McCarthy</a>. From the early 20th century, the <a>Socialist Party of America</a> had a base in Milwaukee. The phenomenon was referred to as "<a>sewer socialism</a>" because the elected officials were more concerned with public works and reform than with revolution (although revolutionary socialism existed in the city as well). Its influence faded in the late 1950s, largely because of the <a>red scare</a> and racial tensions.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> The first Socialist mayor of a large city in the United States was <a>Emil Seidel</a>, elected mayor of Milwaukee in 1910; another Socialist, <a>Daniel Hoan</a>, was mayor of Milwaukee from 1916 to 1940; and a third, <a>Frank P. Zeidler</a>, from 1948 to 1960. Succeeding Frank Zeidler, the last of Milwaukee's Socialist mayors, (<a>Henry Maier</a>), a former Wisconsin State Senator and member of the Democratic Party was elected mayor of Milwaukee in 1960. Maier remained in office for 28 years, the longest-serving mayor in Milwaukee history. Socialist <a>newspaper editor</a><a>Victor Berger</a>  was repeatedly elected as a U.S. Representative, although he was prevented from serving for some time because of his opposition to the First World War.

Through the first half of the 20th century, Wisconsin's politics were dominated by <a>Robert La Follette</a> and his sons, originally of the <a>Republican Party</a>, but later of the revived <a>Progressive Party</a>. Since 1945, the state has maintained a close balance between Republicans and <a>Democrats</a>. Recent leading Republicans include former Governor <a>Tommy Thompson</a> and Congressman <a>Jim Sensenbrenner</a>; prominent Democrats include Senators <a>Herb Kohl</a> and <a>Russ Feingold</a>, the only <a>Senator</a> to vote against the <a>Patriot Act</a> in 2001, and Congressman <a>David Obey</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup>

In 2020, Wisconsin leaned back in the Democratic party's direction as Joe Biden won the state by an even narrower margin of 0.7%. Biden's win was largely carried by Milwaukee and Dane counties with the rural areas of the state being carried by Trump.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup>

<p>
Wisconsin has leaned <a>Democratic</a> in recent presidential elections, although <a>Donald Trump</a> managed to win the state in <a>2016</a> by a narrow margin of 0.8%. This marked the first time Wisconsin voted for a Republican presidential candidate since <a>1984</a>, when every state except Minnesota and Washington D.C. went Republican. In <a>2012</a>, Republican presidential candidate <a>Mitt Romney</a> chose Wisconsin Congressman <a>Paul Ryan</a>, a native of <a>Janesville</a>, as his running mate against incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama and Vice President <a>Joe Biden</a>. Obama nevertheless carried Wisconsin by a margin of 53% to 46%. Both the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections were quite close, with Wisconsin receiving heavy doses of national advertising, in accord with its status as a "swing", or pivot, state. <a>Al Gore</a> carried the presidential vote in 2000 by 5,700 votes, and <a>John Kerry</a> won Wisconsin in 2004 by 11,000 votes. <a>Barack Obama</a> carried the state in 2008 by 381,000 votes (56%).

<p>
Republicans had a stronghold in the <a>Fox Valley</a>, but elected a Democrat, <a>Steve Kagen</a>, of <a>Appleton</a>, for the 8th Congressional District in 2006. However, Kagen survived only two terms and was replaced by Republican Reid Ribble in the Republican Party's sweep of Wisconsin in November 2010, the first time the Republican Party had taken back both chambers of the state legislature and the governorship in the same election. The City of Milwaukee heads the list of Wisconsin's Democratic strongholds, which also includes Madison and the state's Native American <a>reservations</a>. Wisconsin's largest Congressional district, the 7th, had voted Democratic since 1969. Its representative, David Obey, chaired the powerful House Appropriations Committee.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup> However, Obey retired and the once-Democratic seat was taken by Republican <a>Sean Duffy</a> in November 2010. The 2010 elections saw a huge Republican resurgence in Wisconsin. Republicans took control of the governor's office and both houses of the state legislature. Republican <a>Ron Johnson</a> defeated Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator <a>Russ Feingold</a> and Republicans took two previously Democratic-held House seats, creating a 5–3 Republican majority House delegation.

At the statewide level, Wisconsin is competitive, with control regularly alternating between the two parties. In 2006, Democrats gained in a national sweep of opposition to the Bush administration, and the Iraq War. The retiring GOP 8th District Congressman, Mark Green, of Green Bay, ran against the incumbent Governor <a>Jim Doyle</a>. Green lost by 8% statewide, making Doyle the first Democratic governor to be re-elected in 32 years. The Republicans lost control of the state Senate. Although Democrats gained eight seats in the state Assembly, Republicans retained a five-vote majority. In 2008, Democrats regained control of the State Assembly by a 52–46 margin, marking the first time since 1986 that the governor and state legislature were both Democratic.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
With the election of <a>Scott Walker</a> in 2010, Republicans won both chambers of the legislature and the governorship, the first time all three changed partisan control in the same election. His first year in office saw the introduction of the <a>2011 Wisconsin Act 10</a>, which removed collective bargaining rights for state employees. On February 14, 2011, the <a>Wisconsin State Capitol</a><a>erupted with protests</a>  when the Legislature took up a bill that would end most collective bargaining rights for state employees, except for wages, to address the $3.6 billion deficit. The protests attracted tens of thousands of people each day,<sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup> and garnered international attention. The Assembly passed the bill 53–42 on March 10 after the State Senate passed it the night before, and sent it to the Governor for his signature.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup> In response to the <a>bill</a>, enough signatures were gathered to force a <a>recall election</a> against <a>Governor Walker</a>. <a>Tom Barrett</a>, the mayor of Milwaukee and Walker's 2010 opponent, won the Democratic primary and faced Walker again. Walker won the election by 53% to 46% and became the first governor in United States history to retain his seat after a recall election.

Following the 2014 general election on November 4, 2014, the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, State Attorney General and State Treasurer were all Republicans, while the Secretary of State was a Democrat.<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> However, Walker was defeated for a third term in <a>2018</a> by Democrat <a>Tony Evers</a>. Democratic U.S. Senator <a>Tammy Baldwin</a> was also elected to a second term and Democrats won all constitutional statewide offices on the ballot including Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, and State Treasurer, the first time this happened in Wisconsin since 1982. Later however, in April 2019, conservative judge <a>Brian Hagedorn</a> defeated his liberal opponent <a>Lisa Neubauer</a> by 6,100 votes.

The <a>Milwaukee Art Museum</a>, with its <i><a>brise soleil</a></i> designed by <a>Santiago Calatrava</a>, is known for its interesting architecture. <a>Monona Terrace</a> in Madison, a convention center designed by Taliesin architect Anthony Puttnam, is based on a 1930s design by Wisconsin native <a>Frank Lloyd Wright</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup> Wright's home and studio in the 20th century was at <a>Taliesin</a>, south of Spring Green. Decades after Wright's death, Taliesin remains an architectural office and school for his followers.

<h3 id="Alcohol_culture">Alcohol culture</h3>
<p>
Drinking has long been considered a significant part of Wisconsin culture, and the state ranks at or near the top of national measures of per-capita alcohol consumption, consumption of alcohol per state, and proportion of drinkers. Consumption per-capita per-event, however, ranks low among the nation; number of events (number of times alcohol is involved) is significantly higher or highest, but consumption at each event smaller, marking Wisconsin's consumption as frequent and moderate.<sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup> Factors such as cultural identification with the state's heritage of German immigration, the long-standing presence of major breweries in Milwaukee, and a cold climate are often associated with the prevalence of drinking in Wisconsin.

</p>
<p>
In Wisconsin, the legal drinking age is 21, except when accompanied by a parent, guardian, or spouse who is at least 21 years old. Age requirements are waived for possessing alcohol when employed by a brewer, brewpub, beer and/or liquor wholesaler, or producer of alcohol fuel. The minimum legal age to purchase alcohol is 21, with no exceptions.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup> The Absolute Sobriety law states that any person not of legal drinking age (currently 21) may not drive after consuming alcohol.<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup>

On September 30, 2003, the <a>state legislature</a>, reluctant to lower a DUI offense from BAC 0.10 to 0.08, did so only as a result of federal government pressure.<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup> The <a>Wisconsin Tavern League</a> opposes raising the alcoholic beverage tax. The <i><a>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a></i> series "Wasted in Wisconsin" examined this situation.<sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup>

The varied landscape of Wisconsin makes the state a popular vacation destination for outdoor recreation. Winter events include skiing, ice fishing and <a>snowmobile derbies</a>. Wisconsin is situated on two Great Lakes and has many inland lakes of varied size; the state contains 11,188 square miles (28,980 km<sup>2</sup>) of water, more than all but three other states—<a>Alaska</a>, <a>Michigan</a>, and Florida.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Outdoor activities are popular in Wisconsin, especially hunting and fishing. One of the most prevalent game animals is the <a>whitetail deer</a>. Each year, in Wisconsin, well over 600,000 deer-hunting licenses are sold.<sup><a href="#ref_167">[167]</a></sup> In 2008, the <a>Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources</a> projected the pre-hunt deer population to be between 1.5 and 1.7 million.

Wisconsin is represented by major league teams in three sports: football, baseball, and basketball. <a>Lambeau Field</a>, located in <a>Green Bay, Wisconsin</a>, is home to the <a>National Football League</a>'s <a>Green Bay Packers</a>. The Packers have been part of the NFL since the league's second season in 1921 and hold the record for the most NFL titles, earning the city of Green Bay the nickname "Titletown USA". The Packers are the smallest city franchise in the NFL and the only one owned by shareholders statewide. The franchise was founded by "Curly" Lambeau who played and coached for them. The Green Bay Packers are one of the most successful small-market professional sports franchises in the world and have won 13 NFL championships, including the first two AFL-NFL Championship games (<a>Super Bowls</a><a>I</a>  and <a>II</a>), <a>Super Bowl XXXI</a> and <a>Super Bowl XLV</a>. The state's support of the team is evidenced by the 81,000-person waiting list for season tickets to Lambeau Field.<sup><a href="#ref_168">[168]</a></sup>

The <a>Milwaukee Brewers</a>, the state's only major league baseball team, play in <a>American Family Field</a> in Milwaukee, the successor to <a>Milwaukee County Stadium</a> since 2001. In 1982, the Brewers won the <a>American League</a> Championship, marking their most successful season. The team switched from the American League to the National League starting with the 1998 season. Before the Brewers, Milwaukee had two prior Major League teams. The first team, also called the Brewers, played only one season in the newly founded American League in 1901 before moving to St. Louis and becoming the Browns, who are now the <a>Baltimore Orioles</a>. Milwaukee was also the home of the <a>Braves</a> franchise when they moved from Boston from 1953 to 1965, winning the <a>World Series</a> in 1957 and the National League pennant in 1958, before they moved to Atlanta.<sup><a href="#ref_169">[169]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Milwaukee Bucks</a> of the <a>National Basketball Association</a> play home games at the <a>Fiserv Forum</a>. The Bucks won the NBA Championship in 1971 and 2021.<sup><a href="#ref_170">[170]</a></sup>

<p>
Wisconsin also has many college sports programs, including the <a>Wisconsin Badgers</a>, of the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the <a>Panthers</a> of the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. The <a>Wisconsin Badgers football</a> former head coach <a>Barry Alvarez</a> led the Badgers to three <a>Rose Bowl</a> championships, including back-to-back victories in 1999 and 2000. The Badger men's basketball team won the national title in <a>1941</a> and made trips to college basketball's <a>Final Four</a> in <a>2000</a>, <a>2014</a>, and <a>2015</a>. The Badgers claimed a historic dual championship in 2006 when both the <a>women's</a> and <a>men's</a> hockey teams won national titles.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Marquette Golden Eagles</a> of the <a>Big East Conference</a>, the state's other major collegiate program, is known for its <a>men's basketball team</a>, which, under the direction of <a>Al McGuire</a>, won the NCAA National Championship in <a>1977</a>. The team returned to the Final Four in <a>2003</a>.

</p>
<p>
Many other schools in the University of Wisconsin system compete in the <a>Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference</a> at the <a>Division III</a> level. The conference is one of the most successful in the nation, claiming 107 NCAA national championships in 15 different sports as of March 30, 2015.<sup><a href="#ref_174">[174]</a></sup>
</p>
