<b>Wairarapa</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˌ</span><span>w</span><span>aɪ</span><span>r</span><span>ə</span><span>ˈ</span><span>r</span><span>æ</span><span>p</span><span>ə</span></span>/</a></span></span>; <small>Māori pronunciation: </small><span><a>[ˈwaiɾaɾapa]</a></span>), a geographical region of <a>New Zealand</a>, lies in the south-eastern corner of the <a>North Island</a>, east of metropolitan <a>Wellington</a> and south-west of the <a>Hawke's Bay Region</a>.  It is lightly populated, having several rural service towns, with <a>Masterton</a> being the largest.  It is named after its largest lake, <a>Lake Wairarapa</a>.

</p>
<p>
The region is commonly referred to as <b>The Wairarapa</b>, particularly when used after a preposition (e.g., locals will say they live "in the Wairarapa", and travel "to" and "from the Wairarapa").<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h2>
<p>
Wairarapa is shaped like a rectangle, about 130 kilometres (81 mi) long (from Palliser Bay north to Woodville) and 65 kilometres (40 mi) wide (from the Tararua Range east to the coast). The Ngāti Kahungunu tribe's boundary for the region is similar. Their tribal area begins at Pōrangahau and ends at Turakirae. It is the southernmost of their three rohe (homelands) running down the eastern North Island from Wairoa. For the Rangitāne tribe, Wairarapa is part of a wider homeland that includes Manawatu and Horowhenua.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The north–south divide was reinforced in 1989, when local authority boundaries changed. The new Tararua District Council covers northern Wairarapa and southern Hawke's Bay. Central and southern Wairarapa was divided into three district councils: Masterton, Carterton and South Wairarapa.  <a>South Wairarapa District Council</a>, based in Martinborough, is the local government authority for areas south of Carterton, encompassing the towns of Greytown, <a>Featherston</a> and Martinborough and the rural areas down to the Hutt. It is separated from <a>Upper Hutt</a> and <a>Lower Hutt</a> cities by the <a>Rimutaka Ranges</a>. <a>Carterton District Council</a> based in Carterton is the fastest growing area in New Zealand and the <a>Masterton District Council</a> covers areas up to the Tararua District.

</p>
<p>
In terms of national politics, after the proportional representation electoral system was introduced in 1996, the Wairarapa electorate expanded to include southern Hawke's Bay.

</p>
<p>
The area from <a>Mount Bruce</a> north, extending through <a>Eketahuna</a>, <a>Pahiatua</a>, <a>Woodville</a>, <a>Dannevirke</a>, to just north of <a>Norsewood</a> is part of the <a>Tararua District</a> and is in the <a>Manawatū-Whanganui</a> region, because it is in the catchment of the headwaters of the <a>Manawatu River</a>. The river runs westward between the two mountain ranges (<a>Tararua Range</a> to the south and <a>Ruahine Range</a> to the north) via the <a>Manawatu Gorge</a>, to pass through <a>Palmerston North</a> and reach the west coast of the North Island.

</p>
<p>
The east coast contains settlements such as <a>Tinui</a>, <a>Castlepoint</a>, and <a>Riversdale Beach</a>, while the main southern rivers drain through or past <a>Lake Wairarapa</a> to discharge into <a>Palliser Bay</a> east of <a>Cook Strait</a>.

</p>
<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
The name <i>Wairarapa</i> means "glistening waters" in <a>te reo Māori</a>. According to some oral histories, the Polynesian explorer <a>Kupe</a> named the wetlands after touching down in the area several times. According to other oral histories, explorer Haunui named the wetlands after the way the lake appeared to glisten from the <a>Remutaka Ranges</a> to the west.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During British colonial times the region was also known colloquially as <i>The Wydrop</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Rangitane</a> and <a>Ngāti Kahungunu</a> were the resident Māori tribes (<i><a>iwi</a></i>) when European explorers arrived in the area in the 1770s.

</p>
<p>
European settlement began in the early 1840s, initially on large grazing <a>runs</a> leased from <a>Māori</a>, and with closer settlement from the 1850s.

</p>
<p>
On 23 January 1855 the strongest <a>earthquake</a> recorded in New Zealand hit the region; it reached magnitude 8.2 on the <a>Richter Scale</a> and caused five deaths among the then sparse population.

</p>
<h2 id="Economy">Economy</h2>
<p>
The agricultural industries, including forestry, cropping, sheep, beef and dairy farming, are major land users.  The area around <a>Martinborough</a>, in the south, is notable for its vineyards and wine, as are the outskirts of Masterton and Carterton. Beer has been brewed at Mangatainoka, near <a>Pahiatua</a>, since 1889. <a>Deer</a> farming is growing in importance.

</p>
<h3 id="Transport">Transport</h3>
<p>
The region is well served by different transport modes. The State Highway 2, via Rimutaka Hill Road connects the region to Wellington in the south and the Manawatu in the north. The <a>Wairarapa railway line</a> connects the region via the <a>Rimutaka Tunnel</a> to Wellington, and connects with the <a>Palmerston North - Gisborne Line</a> at Woodville. A commuter rail passenger service, the <a>Wairarapa Connection</a> from <a>Masterton</a> to Wellington is operated by <a>Tranz Metro</a>.

</p>
<p>
Many residents, especially in the southern towns such as <a>Featherston</a> and <a>Greytown</a>, commute to work in <a>Wellington</a>, either by train or over the <a>Rimutaka Ranges</a> by car.

</p>
<h2 id="Wildlife">Wildlife</h2>
<p>
Many of New Zealand's endangered native birds can be seen at the <a>Pukaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre</a>, which is just south of <a>Eketahuna</a>.
