<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
The name <i>Emilia-Romagna</i> is a legacy of <a>Ancient Rome</a>. <i>Emilia</i> derives from the <i><a>via Aemilia</a></i>, the Roman road connecting <a>Piacenza</a> to <a>Rimini</a>, completed in 187 BC and named after the consul <a>Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><i>Romagna</i>  derives from <i>Romània</i>, the name of the <a>Eastern Roman Empire</a> applied to <a>Ravenna</a> by the <a>Lombards</a> when the <a>western Empire</a> had ceased to exist and Ravenna was <a>an outpost of the east (540–751)</a>.

<h3 id="Prehistory_and%20antiquity">Prehistory and antiquity</h3>
<p>
Before the Romans took control of present-day Emilia-Romagna, it had been part of the <a>Etruscan</a> world and subsequently that of the <a>Gauls</a>. During the first thousand years of Christianity, trade flourished, as did culture and religion, thanks to the region's numerous <a>monasteries</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Early_origins">Early origins</h3>
<p>
The history of Emilia-Romagna dates back to Roman times when the region of Emilia was ruled by imperial judges linked to the nearby regions of either <a>Liguria</a> or <a>Tuscany</a>. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 6th century, the Lombards, a Germanic tribe, founded the <a>kingdom of Lombardy</a> in northern and central Italy. This kingdom, which included the region known as Emilia, flourished until the Lombard dynasty was overthrown by the Frankish king Charlemagne in 774. From the 6th to 8th centuries, the region of Romagna was under Byzantine rule and Ravenna was the capital of the Exarchate of Italy within the Eastern Roman Empire. In the 8th century, this region became a province of the <a>Papal States</a> when Pepin, the son of Charlemagne, donated the land to the Pope in 754.

</p>
<h3 id="Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</h3>
<p>
During the 10th century, northern Italy became part of the Holy Roman Empire under the control of the Germanic leader Otto I. The Holy Roman emperors had varying degrees of control over northern Italy until the close of the Middle Ages. In the 12th century, the papacy extended its political influence and city states began to form in opposition to the Holy Roman emperors.

</p>
<p>
The northern cities, supported by the Pope, formed the <a>Lombard League</a> and reduced the influence of the ruling Hohenstaufen dynasty over their lands. Division between imperial partisans and their opponents created factions called the Guelphs and the Ghibelines which would divide the cities for centuries. For the next few centuries both Emilia and Romagna were ruled by papal legates or representatives of the Pope.

</p>
<p>
The <a>University of Bologna</a>—arguably the oldest university in Europe,  established in AD 1088—and its bustling towns kept trade and intellectual life alive. Local nobility like the <a>Este</a> of Ferrara, the <a>Malatesta</a> of Rimini, the <a>Popes of Rome</a>, the <a>Farnese</a> of Parma and Piacenza, and the <a>Duchy of Modena and Reggio</a>, jostled for power and influence.

</p>
<p>
The <a>House of Este</a> gained a notable profile for its political and military might and its patronage of the arts: it left behind a vast heritage of splendid Renaissance palaces, precious paintings and literary masterpieces, such as the works of <a>Ludovico Ariosto</a>, <a>Torquato Tasso</a> and <a>Matteo Maria Boiardo</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Under_Austrian%20and%20French%20control">Under Austrian and French control</h3>
<p>
Many regions in northern Italy, that were under Austrian control or influence, including Emilia, came under French control during the Napoleonic era.
After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, there was a growing movement for Italian national unity and independence. In 1848, a revolution in Vienna initiated uprisings against Austrian rule. The following decades saw uprisings in several regions and, in 1861, the Kingdom of Italy was established. During this <a>Italian Unification</a>, the territories of Emilia and Romagna would be incorporated into the new nation.

</p>
<h3 id="Late_modern%20and%20contemporary">Late modern and contemporary</h3>
<p>
In the 16th century, most of what would become Emilia-Romagna has been seized by the Papal States, but the territories of Parma, Piacenza, and Modena remained independent until Emilia-Romagna became part of the <a>Italian kingdom</a> between 1859 and 1861.

</p>
<p>
After the First world war, Emilia-Romagna was at the centre of the so-called <a>Biennio Rosso</a>, a period of left-wing agitations that paved the way for <a>Benito Mussolini</a>'s coup d'état in 1922 and the birth of the Fascist regime in Italy. Mussolini, a native of Emilia-Romagna, sponsored the rise of many hierarchs coming from his same region, such as <a>Italo Balbo</a>, <a>Dino Grandi</a> and <a>Edmondo Rossoni</a>.

</p>
<p>
Towards the end of the <a>Second World War</a>, Emilia-Romagna was <a>occupied by Germany</a> and has been the theatre of numerous <a>Nazi war crimes</a>, such as the <a>Marzabotto massacre</a> in which 770 innocent civilians were brutally executed by German troops.

</p>
<p>
During the <a>Cold war era</a>, Bologna, traditionally a <a>left-wing</a> city, was particularly hit by political street violence and <a>terrorism</a>; in 1980 a <a>far-right terrorist</a> group <a>detonated a bomb</a> at the city's main railway station, killing 85 people and wounding more than 200.

</p>
<p>
After the referendum of 2006, seven municipalities of <a>Montefeltro</a> were detached from the <a>Province of Pesaro and Urbino</a> (<a>Marche</a>) to join that of <a>Rimini</a> on 15 August 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> The municipalities are <a>Casteldelci</a>, <a>Maiolo</a>, <a>Novafeltria</a>, <a>Pennabilli</a>, <a>San Leo</a>, <a>Sant'Agata Feltria</a> and <a>Talamello</a>.

</p>
<p>
On 20 and 29 May, 2012 two <a>powerful earthquakes</a> struck the central area of the region, killing 27 people and causing substantial damages to the region's artistic heritage as well as to numerous manufacturing facilities. The 5.8 magnitude earthquake left 14,000 people temporarily homeless.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>
The region of Emilia-Romagna consists of nine provinces and covers an area of 22,446 km<sup>2</sup> (8,666 sq. mi.), ranking sixth in Italy. Nearly half of the region (48%) consists of plains while 27% is hilly and 25% mountainous. The region's section of the <a>Apennines</a> is marked by areas of <a>flysch</a>, <a>badland</a> erosion (<a>calanques</a>) and <a>caves</a>. The mountains stretch for more than 300 km (186.41 mi) from the north to the south-east, with only three peaks above 2,000 m – <a>Monte Cimone</a> (2,165 m), <a>Monte Cusna</a> (2,121 m) and <a>Alpe di Succiso</a> (2,017 m).

</p>
<p>
The plain was formed by the gradual retreat of the sea from the <a>Po basin</a> and by the detritus deposited by the rivers. Almost entirely <a>marshland</a> in ancient times, its history is characterised by the hard work of its people to reclaim and reshape the land in order to achieve a better standard of living.

</p>
<p>
The <a>geology</a> varies, with <a>lagoons</a> and saline areas in the north and many <a>thermal springs</a> throughout the rest of the region as a result of groundwater rising towards the surface at different periods of history. All the rivers rise locally in the Apennines except for the Po, which has its source in the <a>Alps</a> in <a>Piedmont</a>. The northern border of Emilia-Romagna follows the path of the river for 263 km (163.42 mi).

</p>
<p>
The region has a temperate broadleaved and mixed forests and the vegetation may be divided into belts: the <a>Common oak</a>-<a>European hornbeam</a> belt (<a>Padan plain</a> and adriatic coast) which is now covered (apart from the Mesóla forest in <a>Province of Ferrara</a>) with fruit orchards and fields of <a>wheat</a> and <a>sugar beet</a>, the <a>Pubescent oak</a>-<a>European hop-hornbeam</a> belt on the lower slopes up to 900 m, the <a>European beech</a>-<a>Silver fir</a> belt between 1,000 and 1,500 m and the final mountain <a>heath</a> belt. Emilia-Romagna has two Italian National Parks, the <a>Foreste Casentinesi National Park</a> and the <a>Appennino Tosco-Emiliano National Park</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Land_use">Land use</h3>
<p>
Emilia-Romagna has been a highly populated area since ancient times. Inhabitants over the centuries have radically altered the <a>landscape</a>, building cities, reclaiming wetlands, and establishing large agricultural areas. All these transformations in past centuries changed the aspect of the region, converting large natural areas to cultivation, up until the 1960s. The trend then changed, and agricultural lands began giving way to residential and industrial areas. The increase of urban-industrial areas continued at very high rates until the end of the 2010s. In the same period, hilly and mountainous areas saw an increase in the registration of semi-natural areas, because of the abandonment of agricultural lands.

</p>
<p>
<a>Land use</a> changes can have strong effects on ecological functions. Human interactions such as agriculture, forestation and deforestation affect <a>soil function</a>, e.g. food and other biomass production, storing, filtering and transformation, habitat and gene pool.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the Emilia-Romagna plain, which represents half of the region and where three quarters of the population of the region live, the agricultural land area has been reduced by 157 km<sup>2</sup> while urban and industrial areas have increased to over 130 km<sup>2</sup> between 2003 and 2008. The impact of <a>land use</a> and particularly of the urbanisation of the Emilia-Romagna plain during this period has had some strong consequences in the economical and ecological assessment of the region. The loss of arable land is equivalent to a permanent loss of the capacity to feed 440,000 persons per year from resources grown within the region.  The increased <a>water runoff</a> due to <a>soil sealing</a> requires adaptation measures for river and irrigation canals such as the building of retention basins, at a total cost estimated in the order of billions of euros.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2000 there were 103,700 farm holdings and in 2010 there were 73,470, or a -29.2% loss in holdings for the region. The total utilised agricultural area (UAA) was 1,114,590 hectares (2,754,200 acres) in 2000 and 1,064,210 hectares (2,629,700 acres) in 2014 for a loss of 4.5%, indicating a downturn of smaller farm ownership. During this same timeframe there was a 14.5% decrease in the farm labor workforce.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>

<p>
The Regional Government (<i>Giunta Regionale</i>) is presided by the President of the Region (<i>Presidente della Regione</i>), who is elected for a five-year term. The Regional Government is composed of the President and the Ministers (<i>Assessori</i>), of which there are currently twelve including the Vice President and the Under-Secretary for the President's office.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Apart from the <a>province of Piacenza</a>, Emilia-Romagna was historically a stronghold of the <a>Italian Communist Party</a>, forming the Italian "Red Quadrilateral"<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> or sometimes "<a>Red Belt</a>" called with <a>Tuscany</a>, <a>Umbria</a> and <a>Marche</a>. This is probably due to the strength of the anti-fascist resistance around the time of World War II as well as a strong tradition of <a>anti-clericalism</a> dating from the 19th century, when part of the region belonged to the <a>Papal States</a>. The strength of the anti-fascist resistance is one of the main factors, along with the effectiveness of trade-unionism, that led to the dominance of the PCI in the region.

</p>
<p>
Emilia-Romagna has since World War II been a left-wing stronghold, nowadays led by the <a>Democratic Party</a>, since its creation in 2007.

<h2 id="Demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>
<a>ISTAT</a> estimates the population of Emilia-Romagna was 4,459,577 on January 1, 2019.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> The population density, which was equal to 200 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup> in 2019, is close to the national average. The population of this region is traditionally evenly distributed, with no dominant metropolis but rather a line of medium-sized cities along the <a>Via Emilia</a>, where two thirds of the population and the majority of the industrial production are concentrated. The coast of <a>Romagna</a> is also densely populated due to the booming seaside tourism in recent decades. In the peripheral areas of the Apennine Mountains and the agricultural plains around Ferrara and Piacenza, the population is less dense.

</p>
<h3 id="Cities%2C_towns%20and%20metropolitan%20areas">Cities, towns and metropolitan areas</h3>
<p>
The region has nine cities with populations exceeding one hundred thousand: Bologna, Parma, Modena, Reggio Emilia, Ravenna, Rimini, Ferrara, Forlì and Piacenza. These cities rank among the 50 most populous in Italy. The regional capital, Bologna, has about 400,000 inhabitants and lies at the heart of a <a>metropolitan area</a> of about one million residents.

<p>
Between 1876 and 1976, about 1.2 million people emigrated from Emilia-Romagna to other countries. As of 2008<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, there were 119,369 people from this region living outside Italy, particularly in <a>Argentina</a>, <a>Switzerland</a>, <a>France</a>, the <a>United Kingdom</a> and <a>Brazil</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> As of 2008<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, the Italian National Institute of Statistics (<a>ISTAT</a>) estimated that 365,687 foreign-born immigrants lived in Emilia-Romagna, equal to 8.5% of the total regional population.

The <a>Sillaro</a> river (<a>Emilian</a>: <i>Séllar</i> in Emilian), near the town of <a>Castel San Pietro Terme</a>, is the border between Emilia and Romagna.

Emilia-Romagna today is considered one of the richest European regions and the third wealthiest Italian region by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> These results have been achieved by developing a very well balanced economy that comprises Italy's biggest agricultural sector as well as a long-standing tradition in automobile, motor and mechanics manufacturing and a strong banking and insurance industry.

<p>
In spite of the depth and variety of industrial activities in the region, agriculture has not been eclipsed. Emilia-Romagna is among the leading regions in the country, with farming contributing 5.8% of the gross regional product. The agricultural sector has aimed for increased competitiveness by means of structural reorganisation and high-quality products, and this has led to the success of marketed brands. <a>Cereals</a>, <a>potatoes</a>, <a>maize</a>, <a>tomatoes</a> and <a>onions</a> are the most important products, along with <a>fruit</a> and <a>grapes</a> for the production of <a>wine</a> (of which the best known are Emilia's <a>Lambrusco</a>, Bologna's <a>Pignoletto</a>, Romagna's <a>Sangiovese</a> and white <a>Albana</a>). <a>Cattle</a> and <a>hog</a> breeding are also highly developed. 
Farm <a>cooperatives</a> have been working along these lines in recent years. With their long tradition in the region there are now about 8,100 cooperatives, generally in the agricultural sector and mainly located in the provinces of <a>Bologna</a> (2,160) and <a>Forlì-Cesena</a> (1,300).<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Industry in the region presents a varied and complex picture and is located along the Via Emilia. The food industry (e.g. <a>Barilla Group</a>) is particularly concentrated in <a>Parma</a>, <a>Modena</a> and <a>Bologna</a> as is the mechanical and automotive industry (e.g. <a>Ferrari</a>, <a>Ducati</a>, <a>Lamborghini</a>, <a>De Tomaso</a>, <a>Maserati</a>, <a>Pagani</a>, <a>Sacmi</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> The <a>ceramic</a> sector is concentrated in <a>Faenza</a> and <a>Sassuolo</a>. <a>Tourism</a> is increasingly important, especially along the Adriatic coastline and the cities of art. The regional economy is more geared to export markets than other regions in the country: the main exports are from mechanical engineering (53%), the extraction of non-metallic minerals (13%) and the <a>clothing industry</a> (10%).<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The region of Emilia-Romagna has a very good system of transport, with 574 km of motorways, 1,053 km of railways and airports in Bologna, Forlì, Parma and Rimini. The main motorway crosses the region from north-west (Piacenza) to the south-east (Adriatic coast), connecting the main cities of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, and from here further to Ravenna, Rimini and the Adriatic coast.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

Emilia-Romagna is considered one of the richest regions of Italy with regard to its gastronomic and wine-making tradition. The region is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. <a>Bologna</a> is notable for pasta dishes like <i><a>tortellini</a></i>, <i><a>lasagne</a></i>, <i><a>gramigna</a></i> and <i><a>tagliatelle</a></i> which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations.  The <a>Romagna</a> subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like <i><a>garganelli</a></i>, <i><a>strozzapreti</a></i>, <i><a>sfoglia lorda</a></i> and <i><a>tortelli alla lastra</a></i>. In the <a>Emilia</a> subregion, except <a>Piacenza</a> which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of <a>Lombardy</a>, rice is eaten to a lesser extent. <i><a>Polenta</a></i>, a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna. The celebrated <a>balsamic vinegar</a> is made only in the Emilian cities of <a>Modena</a> and <a>Reggio Emilia</a>, following legally binding traditional procedures.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup><a>Parmigiano Reggiano</a>  (Parmesan Cheese) is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while <a>Grana Padano</a> variety is produced in the rest of the region.

<p>
Although the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area which produces eels and clams, the region produces more meat products, especially pork-based, including Parma's <i><a>prosciutto</a></i>, <i><a>culatello</a></i> and <i><a>Salame Felino</a></i>, Piacenza's <i><a>pancetta</a></i>, <i><a>coppa</a></i> and salami, Bologna's <i><a>mortadella</a></i> and <i><a>salame rosa</a></i>, Modena's <i><a>zampone</a></i>, <i><a>cotechino</a></i> and <i><a>cappello del prete</a></i>  and <a>Ferrara</a>'s <i><a>salama da sugo</a></i>. <a>Reggio Emilia</a> is the origin of the fresh egg-made pasta <i><a>cappelletti</a></i> (similar to Bologna's tortellini but differing in size), the typical <i><a>erbazzone</a></i> a spinach and <i><a>Parmigiano Reggiano</a></i> salted cake, and <i><a>Gnocco Fritto</a></i>, mixed flour stripes fried in boiling oil, eaten in combination with ham or salami. <i><a>Crescentina</a></i> is a thin round bread that originates in the Apennines around Modena, and is usually filled with <i>cunza</i> (a spread made from pork lard and flavoured with garlic and rosemary) or with cold cuts, cheese and salty dressings or sweet spreads. Piacenza and Ferrara are also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include <i><a>zuppa inglese</a></i> (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and <a>Alchermes</a> liqueur) and <i><a>panpepato</a></i> (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds). An exhaustive list of the most important regional wines should include <a>Sangiovese</a> from Romagna, <a>Lambrusco</a> from <a>Reggio Emilia</a> or <a>Modena</a>, <a>Cagnina di Romagna</a>, <a>Gutturnio</a> and <a>Trebbiano</a> from <a>Piacenza</a>.

<h3 id="Music">Music</h3>
<p>
Emilia-Romagna gave birth to one of the most important composers in the history of music, <a>Giuseppe Verdi</a>, as well as <a>Arturo Toscanini</a>, one of the most acclaimed conductors of the 20th century, and the operatic tenor <a>Luciano Pavarotti</a>.

</p>
<p>
