<p>
Present-day Pickens of Pickens County was previously <a>Cherokee</a> Territory. During the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>, the Cherokee sided with the <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. When Great Britain was defeated in the war, the Cherokee were forced to surrender their land. In 1791, the state legislature established Washington District that comprises present-day <a>Greenville</a>, <a>Anderson</a>, <a>Oconee</a>, and <a>Pickens</a> Counties. In 1798 Washington District was divided into Greenville and Pendleton districts. The Pendleton district eventually became Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens County. Pendleton District was divided in 1828 into Anderson and Pickens. A courthouse was established on the banks of the <a>Keowee River</a> where the town of <b>Pickens Court House</b> was developed. The <a>Hagood-Mauldin House</a> was built <i>circa</i> 1856 and is one of the historic structures of Pickens County. In 1868, the Pickens District was divided for a final time, into Pickens and Oconee counties. Pickens Court House relocated to its present-day site and was renamed to Pickens.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Pickens Railway</a> was established in 1898 as a shortline railroad from <a>Easley</a> to Pickens.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> From 1955 until 1987, <a>Sangamo-Weston Inc.</a> operated a capacitor manufacturing facility just outside Pickens. Until they were banned in the US, Sangamo discharged a significant amount of <a>polychlorinated biphenyls</a> (PCBs) into a tributary of the Twelve Mile River which feeds into <a>Lake Hartwell</a>. Sangamo also dumped contaminated waste in six locations in the vicinity of Pickens. In two of these locations, the waste was burned, forming more dangerous <a>dioxins</a>. According to the <i><a>Spartanburg Herald-Journal</a></i>, contamination was discovered at the "Breazeale site", southwest of town. Schlumberger paid $11.8 million to federal and state agencies for injuries to natural resources caused by the contamination.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>

Pickens is located at <link></link><span><a><span><span><span>34°52′54″N</span><span>82°42′27″W</span></span></span><span>﻿ / ﻿</span><span><span>34.88167°N 82.70750°W</span><span>﻿ / <span>34.88167; -82.70750</span></span></span></a></span> (34.881700, -82.707477).<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the <a>United States Census Bureau</a>, the town had a total area of 2.5 square miles (6.4 km<sup>2</sup>), of which 2.5 square miles (6.3 km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km<sup>2</sup>) (0.81%) is water.

</p>
<p>
Pickens also has several small mountains that surround the city. <a>Glassy Mountain</a>, located east of Pickens, is a small mountain that can be reached by several small private roads. Glassy Mountain is an excellent example of a piedmont monadnock, which are rare in South Carolina.  Sixty-five acres of the mountain are part of the South Carolina Heritage Trust, and contain varied and rare plant species. Perhaps one of the most famous mountains in the area is <a>Table Rock State Park</a>, located just to the north of Pickens, but still in the Pickens area, which has been a symbol for Pickens and can be seen throughout Pickens and nearby cities such as <a>Easley</a> and <a>Greenville</a>. In addition to Table Rock Mountain, the park contains Pinnacle Mountain, the highest mountain contained entirely within the state of South Carolina.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
