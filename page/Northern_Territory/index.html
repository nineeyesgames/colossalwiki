<p>
The <b>Northern Territory</b> (<b>NT</b>; formally the <b>Northern Territory of Australia</b><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>) is an <a>Australian territory</a> in the central and central northern regions of <a>Australia</a>. The Northern Territory shares its borders with <a>Western Australia</a> to the west (<a>129th meridian east</a>), <a>South Australia</a> to the south (<a>26th parallel south</a>), and <a>Queensland</a> to the east (<a>138th meridian east</a>). To the north, the territory looks out to the <a>Timor Sea</a>, the <a>Arafura Sea</a> and the <a>Gulf of Carpentaria</a>, including <a>Western New Guinea</a> and other islands of the <a>Indonesian</a> archipelago.

</p>
<p>
The NT covers 1,349,129 square kilometres (520,902 sq mi), making it the third-largest Australian federal division, and <a>the 11th-largest country subdivision in the world</a>. It is sparsely populated, with a population of only 247,000<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> as of September 2021<sup><a>[update]</a></sup> – fewer than half as many people as in <a>Tasmania</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> The largest population center is the capital city of <a>Darwin</a>.

</p>
<p>
The archaeological history of the Northern Territory may have begun more than 60,000 years ago when <a>humans</a> first settled this region of the <a>Sahul</a> Continent. Reportedly<sup>[<i><a><span>according to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> the <a>Makassan traders</a> began a relationship  with the indigenous people of the Northern Territory around the trading of  <a>trepang</a> from at least the 18th century. The coast of the territory was first seen by Europeans in the 17th century.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The British were the first Europeans to attempt to settle the coastal regions. After three failed attempts to establish a settlement (1824–28, 1838–49, and 1864–66), success was achieved in 1869 with the establishment of a settlement at <a>Port Darwin</a>.

</p>
<p>
The economy is based largely on mining and petroleum, which during 2018–2019 contributed 23% of the <a>gross state product</a>, or $5.68 billion, accounting for 92.4% of exports.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The territory’s population is concentrated in coastal regions and along the <a>Stuart Highway</a>. Besides the capital of Darwin, the major settlements are (in order of size) <a>Palmerston</a>, <a>Alice Springs</a>, <a>Katherine</a>, <a>Nhulunbuy</a> and <a>Tennant Creek</a>. Residents of the Northern Territory are often known simply as "Territorians" and fully as "Northern Territorians", or more informally as "Top Enders" and "Centralians".

<p>
Humans have lived in the present area of the Northern Territory since at least 48.4 to 68.7 thousand years ago <sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> and for at least the last five centuries of that time, extensive seasonal trade links are said to have existed between the <a>Indigenous</a> peoples of this area and what is now <a>Indonesia</a>.

</p>
<p>
With the coming of the British, there were four early attempts to settle the harsh environment of the northern coast, of which three failed in starvation and despair. The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial <a>New South Wales</a> from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of <a>North Australia</a>. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911. Under the administration of colonial South Australia, the <a>overland telegraph</a> was constructed between 1870 and 1872.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
From its establishment in 1869 the Port of Darwin was the major Territory supply for many decades.

</p>
<p>
A railway was built between <a>Palmerston</a> and <a>Pine Creek</a> between 1883 and 1889. The economic pattern of cattle raising and mining was established so that by 1911 there were 513,000 cattle. <a>Victoria River Downs</a> was at one time the largest <a>cattle station</a> in the world. Gold was found at Grove Hill in 1872 and at <a>Pine Creek</a>, Brocks Creek, Burundi, and copper was found at <a>Daly River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 1 January 1911, a decade after federation, the Northern Territory, alongside the <a>Australian Capital Territory</a>, was separated from South Australia and transferred to federal control. <a>Alfred Deakin</a> opined at this time "To me the question has been not so much commercial as national, first, second, third and last. Either we must accomplish the peopling of the northern territory or submit to its transfer to some other nation."<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Letters_Patent_Northern_Territory.jpg/220px-Letters_Patent_Northern_Territory.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
In late 1912 there was growing sentiment that the name "Northern Territory" was unsatisfactory.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> The names "Kingsland" (after <a>King George V</a> and to correspond with <a>Queensland</a>), "Centralia" and "Territoria" were proposed with Kingsland becoming the preferred choice in 1913. However, the name change never went ahead.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
For a brief time between 1927 and 1931 the Northern Territory was divided into <a>North Australia</a> and <a>Central Australia</a> at the <a>20th parallel of South latitude</a>. Soon after this time, parts of the Northern Territory were considered in the <a>Kimberley Plan</a> as a possible site for the establishment of a <a>Jewish Homeland</a>, understandably considered the "Un<a>promised Land</a>".<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During World War II, most of the Top End was placed under military government. This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The <a>Bombing of Darwin</a> occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin's World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.

</p>
<p>
<a>Indigenous Australians</a> had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the <a>strike and walk off</a> by the <a>Gurindji people</a> at <a>Wave Hill Cattle Station</a> in 1966. The <a>Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights</a> (NTCAR) supported the strikers and provided publicity.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>  The federal government of <a>Gough Whitlam</a> set up <a>the Woodward Royal Commission</a> in February 1973, which set to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. <a>Justice Woodward</a>'s first report in July 1973 recommended that a <a>Central Land Council</a> and a <a>Northern Land Council</a> be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. In response to the report of the Royal Commission a Land Rights Bill was drafted, but the Whitlam Government was dismissed before it was passed.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The <i><a>Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976</a></i> was eventually passed by the <a>Fraser</a> government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977).<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical <a>Cyclone Tracy</a>. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (approximately A$6.85 billion as of 2018<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>,<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights was disestablished in 1976.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1978 the territory was granted <a>responsible government</a>, with a Legislative Assembly headed by a <a>chief minister</a>. The territory also publishes official notices in its own <i><a>Government Gazette</a></i>. The <a>administrator of the Northern Territory</a> is an official acting as the Queen's <i>indirect</i> representative in the territory.

</p>
<p>
During 1995–96 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with <a>legal voluntary euthanasia</a>, until the Federal Parliament overturned <a>the legislation</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> Before the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr <a>Philip Nitschke</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
There are many very small settlements scattered across the territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the <a>Stuart Highway</a>, known to locals simply as "the track".

</p>
<p>
The Northern Territory is home to two spectacular natural rock formations, <a>Uluru</a> (Ayers Rock) and <a>Kata Tjuta</a> (The Olgas), which are sacred to the local Aboriginal people and which have become major tourist attractions.

</p>
<p>
The northern portion of the territory is principally <a>tropical savannas</a>, composed of several distinct <a>ecoregions</a> – <a>Arnhem Land tropical savanna</a>, <a>Carpentaria tropical savanna</a>, <a>Kimberley tropical savanna</a>, <a>Victoria Plains tropical savanna</a>, and <a>Mitchell Grass Downs</a>. The southern portion of the territory is covered in <a>deserts and xeric shrublands</a>, including the <a>Great Sandy-Tanami desert</a>, <a>Simpson Desert</a>, and <a>Central Ranges xeric scrub</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In the northern part of the territory lies <a>Kakadu National Park</a>, which features extensive <a>wetlands</a> and native wildlife. To the north of that lies the <a>Arafura Sea</a>, and to the east lies <a>Arnhem Land</a>, whose regional centre is <a>Maningrida</a> on the Liverpool River delta.
There is an extensive series of river systems in the Northern Territory. These rivers include: the <a>Alligator Rivers</a>, <a>Daly River</a>, <a>Finke River</a>, <a>McArthur River</a>, <a>Roper River</a>, <a>Todd River</a> and <a>Victoria River</a>. The Hay River is a river south-west of Alice Springs, with the Marshall River, Arthur Creek, Camel Creek and Bore Creek flowing into it.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>
The Northern Territory has two distinctive climate zones.

</p>
<p>
The northern end, including Darwin, has a tropical climate with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (October to April) and dry season (May to September). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as 14 °C (57 °F), but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.

</p>
<p>
The wet season is associated with <a>tropical cyclones</a> and <a>monsoon</a> rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when <a>thunderstorms</a> are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than 1,570 mm (62 in) of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from 1,800 to 2,100 mm (71 to 83 in).

</p>
<p>
The central region is the <a>desert</a> centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and <a>Uluru</a> (Ayers Rock), and is <a>semi-arid</a> with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Seasons are more distinct in central Australia, with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost is recorded a few times a year. The region receives less than 250 mm (9.8 in) of rain per year.

</p>
<p>
The highest temperature recorded in the territory was 48.3 °C (118.9 °F) at <a>Finke</a> on 1 and 2 January 1960. The lowest temperature was −7.5 °C (18.5 °F) at Alice Springs on 17 July 1976.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>

The Northern Territory Parliament is one of the three <a>unicameral</a> parliaments in the country. Based on the <a>Westminster System</a>, it consists of the <a>Northern Territory Legislative Assembly</a> which was created in 1974, replacing the <a>Northern Territory Legislative Council</a>. It also produces the <i><a>Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette</a></i>.

</p>

The Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.

</p>
<p>
While this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated <a>devolution</a> of powers from the <a>Commonwealth Government</a>, rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The <a>Monarch</a> is represented by the <a>Administrator of the Northern Territory</a>, who performs a role similar to that of a <a>state governor</a>.

</p>
<p>
Twenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member <a>electorates</a>.

</p>
<p>
For some years there has been <a>agitation for full statehood</a>. A <a>referendum</a> of voters in the Northern Territory was held on the issue in 1998, which resulted in a 'no' vote. This was a shock to both the Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments, as opinion polls showed most Territorians supported statehood. But under the Australian Constitution, the federal government may set the terms of entry to full statehood. The Northern Territory was offered three senators, rather than the twelve guaranteed to original states. (Because of the difference in populations, equal numbers of Senate seats would mean a Territorian's vote for a senator would have been worth more than 30 votes in <a>New South Wales</a> or <a>Victoria</a>.) Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister <a>Shane Stone</a>, it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>

The <a>chief minister</a> is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a <i><a>premier</a></i>). The chief minister is appointed by the <a>administrator</a>, who in normal circumstances appoints the leader of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The current chief minister is <a>Michael Gunner</a> of the <a>Australian Labor Party</a>. He replaced <a>Adam Giles</a> on 31 August 2016.

<p>
The Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978 under its own <a>administrator</a> appointed by the <a>Governor-General of Australia</a>. The federal government, not the NT government, advises the governor-general on the appointment of the administrator, but by convention consults first with the Territory government. The current administrator is <a>Vicki O'Halloran</a>.

Indigenous Australians own some 49% of the land. The life expectancy of Aboriginal Australians is well below that of non-Indigenous Australians in the Northern Territory, a fact that is mirrored elsewhere in Australia. ABS statistics suggest that Indigenous Australians die about 11 years earlier than the average non-Indigenous Australian. There are Aboriginal communities in many parts of the territory, the largest ones being the <a>Pitjantjatjara</a> near <a>Uluru</a>, the <a>Arrernte</a> near Alice Springs, the <a>Luritja</a> between those two, the <a>Warlpiri</a> further north, and the <a>Yolngu</a> in eastern <a>Arnhem Land</a>.

<h3 id="Primary_and%20secondary">Primary and secondary</h3>
<p>
A Northern Territory school education consists of six years of primary schooling, including one transition year, three years of middle schooling, and three years of secondary schooling. In the beginning of 2007, the Northern Territory introduced Middle School for Years 7–9 and High School for Years 10–12. Northern Territory children generally begin school at age five. On completing secondary school, students earn the <a>Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training</a> (NTCET). Students who successfully complete their secondary education also receive a tertiary entrance ranking, or ATAR score, to determine university admittance.

</p>
<p>
Northern Territory schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the Department of Education.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Private fee-paying schools include schools run by the Catholic Church and independent schools, some elite ones similar to English <a>public schools</a>. Some Northern Territory Independent schools are affiliated with <a>Protestant</a>, <a>Lutheran</a>, <a>Anglican</a>, <a>Greek Orthodox</a> or <a>Seventh-day Adventist Churches</a>, but include non-church schools and an Indigenous school.

</p>
<p>
As of 2009, the Northern Territory had 151 public schools, 15 Catholic schools and 21 independent schools. 39,492 students were enrolled in schools around the territory with 29,175 in public schools, and 9,882 in independent schools. The Northern Territory has about 4,000 full-time teachers.

<p>
The Northern Territory's economy is largely driven by <a>mining</a>, which is concentrated on energy producing <a>minerals</a>, petroleum and energy and contributes around $2.5 billion to the <a>gross state product</a> and employs over 4,600 people. Mining accounts for 14.9% of the gross state product in 2014–15 compared to just 7% nationally.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In recent years, largely due to the effect of major infrastructure projects and mine expansions, construction has overtaken mining as the largest single industry in the territory. Construction, mining and manufacturing, and government and community services, combine to account for about half of the territory's gross state product (GSP), compared to about a third of national gross domestic product (GDP).<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The economy has grown considerably over the past decade, from a value of $15 billion in 2004–05 to over $22 billion in 2014–15. In 2012–13 the territory economy expanded by 5.6%, over twice the level of national growth, and in 2014–15 it grew by 10.5%, four times the national growth rate.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Between 2003 and 2006 the gross state product had risen from $8.67 billion to $11.476 billion, an increase of 32.4%. During the three years to 2006–2007 the Northern Territory gross state product grew by an average annual rate of 5.5%. Gross state product per capita in the Northern Territory ($72,496) is higher than any Australian state or territory and is also higher than the gross domestic product per capita for Australia ($54,606).

</p>
<p>
The Northern Territory's exports were up 12.9% or $681 million in 2012–13. The largest contributor to the territory's exports was: mineral fuels (largely LNG), crude materials (mainly mineral ores) and food and live animals (primarily live cattle). The main international markets for territory exports are Japan, China, Indonesia, the United States and Korea.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Imports to the Northern Territory totalled $2,887.8 million which consisted of mainly machinery and equipment manufacturing (58.4%) and petroleum, coal, chemical and associated product manufacturing (17.0%).<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The principal mining operations are bauxite at Gove Peninsula where the production is estimated to increase 52.1% to $254 million in 2007–08, manganese at Groote Eylandt, production is estimated to increase 10.5% to $1.1 billion which will be helped by the newly developed mines include Bootu Creek and Frances Creek, gold which is estimated to increase 21.7 per cent to $672 million at the Union Reefs plant and uranium at Ranger Uranium Mine.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Tourism">Tourism</h3>
<p>
Tourism is an important economic driver for the territory and a significant industry in regional areas.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> Iconic destinations such as <a>Uluru</a> and <a>Kakadu</a> make the Northern Territory a popular destination for domestic and international travellers. Diverse <a>landscapes</a>, <a>waterfalls</a>, wide open spaces, <a>aboriginal culture</a> and wild and untamed <a>wildlife</a> provides the opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves in the natural wonder that the Northern Territory offers. In 2015, the territory received a total of about 1.6 million domestic and international visitors contributing an estimated $2.0 billion to the local economy. Holiday visitors made up the majority of total visitation (about 792,000 visitors).

</p>
<p>
Tourism has strong links to other sectors in the economy including accommodation and food services, retail trade, recreation and culture, and transport.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>

The Northern Territory is the most sparsely populated state or territory in Australia.

</p>
<p>
The NT has a connected network of sealed roads, including two National Highways, linking with adjoining States and connecting the major Territory population centres, and other important centres such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), <a>Kakadu</a> and Litchfield National Parks. The Stuart Highway, once known as "The Track", runs north to south, connecting Darwin and Alice Springs to <a>Adelaide</a>. Some of the sealed roads are single lane bitumen. Many unsealed (dirt) roads connect the more remote settlements.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Adelaide–Darwin railway</a>, a new <a>standard gauge</a> railway, connects Adelaide via <a>Alice Springs</a> with Darwin, replacing earlier <a>narrow gauge railways</a> which had a gap between Alice Springs and <a>Birdum</a>. <a>The Ghan</a> passenger train runs from Darwin to Adelaide, stopping at <a>Katherine</a>, <a>Tennant Creek</a>, <a>Alice Springs</a> and <a>Kulgera</a> in the NT.

</p>
<p>
The Northern Territory was one of the few remaining places in the world with no speed restrictions on select public roads, until 21 November 2016. On 1 January 2007 a default speed limit of 110 km/h was introduced on roads outside of urban areas (Inside urban areas of 40, 50 or 60 km/h). Speeds of up to 130 km/h are permitted on some major highways, such as the Stuart Highway.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> On 1 February 2014, the speed limit was removed on a 204 km portion of the Stuart Highway for a one-year trial period.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> The maximum speed limit was changed to 130 km/h on 21 November 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><a>Darwin International Airport</a>  is the major domestic and international airport for the territory. Several smaller airports are also scattered throughout the territory and are served by smaller airlines; including <a>Alice Springs Airport</a>, <a>Ayers Rock Airport</a>, <a>Katherine Airport</a> and <a>Tennant Creek Airport</a>.
