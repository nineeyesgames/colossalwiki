<p>
The <b>Department of Antioquia</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small><span><a>[anˈtjokja]</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span> ) is one of the 32 <a>departments of Colombia</a>, located in the central Northwestern part of Colombia with a narrow section that borders the <a>Caribbean Sea</a>. Most of its territory is <a>mountainous</a> with some <a>valleys</a>, much of which is part of the <a>Andes</a> mountain range. Antioquia has been part of many territorial divisions of former countries created within the present-day territory of Colombia. Prior to adoption of the <a>Colombian Constitution of 1886</a>, <a>Antioquia State</a> had its own sovereign government.

</p>
<p>
The department covers an area of 63,612 km<sup>2</sup> (24,427 sq mi), and has a population of 5,819,358 (2006 estimate); 6.6 million (2010 estimate). Antioquia borders the <a>Córdoba Department</a> and the <a>Caribbean Sea</a> to the north; <a>Chocó</a> to the west; the departments of <a>Bolivar</a>, <a>Santander</a>, and <a>Boyaca</a> to the east; and the departments of <a>Caldas</a> and <a>Risaralda</a> to the south.

</p>
<p>
<a>Medellín</a> is Antioquia's capital city, and the second-largest city in the country. Other important towns are <a>Santa Fe de Antioquia</a>, the old capital located on the <a>Cauca River</a>, and <a>Puerto Berrío</a> on the <a>Magdalena</a>.

<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
Antioquia is the <a>sixth-largest Department of Colombia</a>. It is predominantly mountainous, crossed by the <a>Cordillera Central</a> and the <a>Cordillera Occidental</a> of the <a>Andes</a>. The <a>Cordillera Central</a> divides to form the <a>Aburrá valley</a>, in which the capital, <a>Medellín</a>, is located. The <a>Cordillera Central</a> forms the plateaus of <a>Santa Rosa de Osos</a> and <a>Rionegro</a>.

</p>
<p>
While 80% of the department's territory is mountainous, Antioquia also has lowlands in <a>Bajo Cauca</a>, <a>Magdalena Medio</a>, and eastern <a>Sonsón</a>, as well as coastline on the <a>Caribbean Sea</a>, in <a>Urabá</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> This area has a tropical climate and is of high strategic importance due to its location.

</p>
<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<h3 id="Native_people%20of%20Antioquia">Native people of Antioquia</h3>
<p>
Before Spanish colonization, different indigenous tribes inhabited this part of modern Colombia. Their origin is uncertain, as specialists believe that some came from the Caribbean island, and others that they originated among peoples along the interior <a>Amazon River</a>. 

</p>
<p>
Antioquia was primarily populated by the <a>Carib people</a>. Some scattered groups of <a>Muisca</a> were said to be present in the <a>Darién</a> region (in modern-day <a>Panama</a>), a coastal region in the far north of Antioquia. But, no historical records refer to Muisca in Antioquia.

</p>
<p>
The Carib occupying territory in Antioquia were known by classifications of smaller groups, called <i>families</i>.  Some of the most prominent native families in the region include the Catía, Nutabe, and <a>Tahamíe</a>, who all inhabited the central region of Antioquia.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Quimbaya</a> occupied southern Antioquia.

</p>
<p>
The historic Quimbaya, Carib and Muisca tribes were the most prominent groups encountered by the <a>conquistadors</a> upon their arrival in Antioquia. The Quimbaya had a lot to do with the development of the department.

</p>
<p>
The Spaniards had a turbulent history of encounters with the Carib. Although the tribe was numerous and known for its warring culture, the various peoples of this family became dominated or exterminated by the Spaniards in the process of <a>conquest</a> and <a>colonization</a>. As did all Native Americans, they suffered extremely high mortality due to newly introduced infectious Eurasian diseases, to which they had no <a>immunity</a>.

</p>
<p>
In some cases the surviving natives dispersed to evade the Spanish, and some committed suicide to escape being enslaved or subjected to forced labor. Many survivors fled to the modern <a>department of Chocó</a>. In Antioquia, the natives disappeared almost completely. At present, the autochthon population of the department of Antioquia scarcely reaches 0.5% of the total population.

</p>
<h3 id="Basque_influence%20in%20Antioquia">Basque influence in Antioquia</h3>
<p>
A debate, centered around the apparently significant Jewish origin of Antioquians, took place from mid-nineteenth century to the twentieth century. Others, later pointed to Basque origins as a way to understand the population's idiosyncrasies. Prominent among these, were two American historians: Everett Hagen and Leonard Kasdan. Hagen looked at the telephone directory in Medellin in 1957 and found that 15% of the surnames were of Basque origin, finding then that employers in the percentage of surnames was up to 25%, which led him to conclude that Basque settlers were very important in explaining the increased industrial development of Antioquia in the Colombian context. These ideas were supported by representatives of developmental theories, who sought to justify business growth based on "the character of social groups."

</p>
<p>
The use of <a>Basque language</a> (Euskera) terminology in the present territory of Colombia goes back to the early exploration in 1499, during the <a>third voyage of Columbus</a>, it is said that from that time the territory experienced a strong presence of <a>Basques</a>, including prominent figures such as the pilot and geographer <a>Juan de la Cosa</a>, nicknamed <i>"el vizcaino"</i>. (Some sources claim that he was not a native of the <a>Basque Country</a>, but was born in <a>Santoña</a>, Cantabria).<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
More Basque colonists reached this area and began to settled in the region. The Colombian department of Antioquia has been considered a major route of the Basque-<a>Navarre</a> immigration, mainly during the colonial era. Hundreds of Basques migrated as settlers sponsored by the Spanish colonization companies.

</p>
<p>
People who were interested in investigating the presence of the Basque people in the department of Antioquia and Colombia have been troubled by the question that relates to the use and retention of the Basque language in their current territories.

</p>
<p>
It is estimated, for example, for smaller Antioquia, a region where hundreds of Spaniards arrived, of which a good portion were Basque, some limited aspects of the culture and traditions were brought by Basque settlers, though without any mention of their particular language, thus tracking the use of Basque in the current Antioquia and Colombia. However, this is partly due to the Basque language always having been an outcast, which apparently left no written evidence in Antioquia.

</p>
<p>
In this regard, it is hardly likely that the Spanish crown—in order to maintain the monopoly of overseas companies, to maintain policies that restrict citizens not belonging to the then Spanish rule—would allow its colonies to speak languages other than Spanish.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Those Basques invited to participate in the colonization companies, and foreigners in general, had to learn the official language, i.e., Spanish, hence the dominance of Spanish.

</p>
<p>
Despite these restrictions, it is still possible to trace the history of Colombia's present references to the ancient language of the Basques. A reference that has very ancient use of <a>Euskara</a> in Colombian territory, occurred in relation to <a>Lope de Aguirre</a>, a native of <a>Gipuzkoa</a> nicknamed "The Madman". Aguirre's rebellion defied the Spanish Empire, carrying out acts against the subjects of the Spanish crown. <a>Pedro de Ursúa</a>, a Navarrese faithful to the Spanish king, who was also the founder of <a>Pamplona</a> in eastern Colombia, said that he could persuade the soldiers to be told of Aguirre's revolt, if they spoke in Euskara.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
After the <a>Spanish Civil War</a>, many Basque families migrated to Colombia. A number of these families were Basque-speakers and wrote works in Euskara and, likewise, translated from Spanish to Basque literary works of Colombian authors.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The current Spanish dialect in Antioquia, closely observed, has obvious influences from Basque. Basque influence is evident in words such <i>coscorria</i> (useless, inept) and 'tap' (tap), to name only a few cases.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Basque also influenced the pronunciation of the letter <a>'s' apico-alveolar</a> (transitional between 's' and 'sh'), so in the Antioquia, and the letter "ll" (double L) pronounced as an affricative, not to overlook the <a>inclusion</a> of the letter "a" before certain initial Rs: <i>arrecostarse</i> instead of <i>recostarse</i>, <i>arrecoger</i> instead of <i>recoger</i> and <i>arrecordarse</i> instead of <i>recordarse</i>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Spaniards_in%20Antioquia">Spaniards in Antioquia</h3>
<p>
The first Spaniard known to have visited the territory now known as Antioquia was <a>Rodrigo de Bastidas</a>, who explored the area around the future site of <a>Darién</a> in 1500. Ten years later, <a>Alonso de Ojeda</a> founded <a>San Sebastián de Urabá</a>, 2 km from the present-day town of <a>Necoclí</a>. It was later destroyed by the natives. The first Spanish military incursion into Antioquia, however, was not made until 1537. An expedition commanded by <a>Francisco César</a> traveled through the lands of chief Dabeiba, arriving at the <a>Cauca River</a>. They were said to have taken important treasures from the indigenous people's tombs. In response, the warriors of chief Nutibara harassed the Spaniards continually, and forced them to return to <a>Urabá</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1541, the conquistador <a>Jorge Robledo</a> departed from the site of the future (1542) Spanish town of Arma, a little below Aguadas in the North of Caldas, to lead an expedition north on the Cauca River.

</p>
<p>
Farther north, Robledo would found the city of <a>Santa Fe de Antioquia</a>, which in 1813 was declared the capital of the sovereign and independent state of Antioquia, and remained the seat of the governate until 1826, when Medellin was designated the capital.

</p>
<p>
Other Spaniards who settled Antioquia came from Extremadura, Catalonia, Andalusia, and the Canary Islands. The Extremadurans and Catalans influenced the pronunciation of the letter 's' as an apico-alveolar, like Basques. Andalusians and Canarians influenced <i><a>seseo</a></i> in the Spanish dialect.

</p>
<h3 id="Toponymy">Toponymy</h3>
<p>
The reason behind the chosen name for the department is not historically clear. The most accepted<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> explanation is that the name for the, then <a>Greek</a>-<a>Syrian</a> (now <a>Turkish</a>), <a>Hellenistic</a> city of <a>Antioch on the Orontes</a> (<a>Greek</a>: <span>Antiochia</span>, Αντιοχεία, <a>Arabic</a>: Antākiyyah, today <a>Antakya</a>) was used since the region known as the Coffee Zone in Colombia, in which many towns and cities are named after cities in the Middle East, has a very strong <a>Judeo</a>-<a>Arabic</a> influence, both demographically and culturally. Additionally, the city in mention played a significant role in the development of early <a>Christian</a> communities thus religiously important for Roman Catholic Spaniard conquerors. Others state that it is named after some of the many other Hellenistic ancient cities in the Middle East named <a>Antiochia</a>, which were founded as well by some of the <a>Antiochus</a> Kings during the Seleucid Empire (312–63 BC).

</p>
<h3 id="16th_to%20the%2021st%20centuries">16th to the 21st centuries</h3>
<p>
Due to its geographical isolation (as it is located among mountains), Antioquia suffered supply problems. Its topography did not allow for much agriculture, so the city became dependent upon trade, especially of gold and gin for the colonization of new land. Much of this trade was due to reforms passed after a 1785 visit from <a>Juan Antonio Mon y Velarde</a>, an inspector of the Spanish Crown. The Antioquia became colonizers and traders.

</p>
<p>
The department was hard hit by the <a>Colombian conflict</a>, with 30,000 people missing between 1997 and 2005.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<i><a>The Wall Street Journal</a></i> and Citi announced in the year 2013 that <a>Medellín</a>, the capital of the Department of Antioquia, is the winner of the City of the Year competition, a global program developed in partnership with the <a>Urban Land Institute</a> to recognize the most innovative urban centers. Medellín was ranked above the other finalists, <a>Tel Aviv</a> and <a>New York City</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>
