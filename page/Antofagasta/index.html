<b>Antofagasta</b> (<small>Spanish pronunciation: </small><span><a>[antofaˈɣasta]</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span> ) is a <a>port city</a> in northern <a>Chile</a>, about 1,100 kilometres (700 mi) north of <a>Santiago</a>.  It is the capital of <a>Antofagasta Province</a> and <a>Antofagasta Region</a>.  According to the 2015 census, the <a>city</a> has a population of 402,669.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After the <a>Spanish American wars of independence</a>, <a>Bolivia</a> claimed Antofagasta as part its territory. Despite having an overwhelmingly Chilean population Chile <a>recognised Bolivian sovereignty of Antofagasta in 1866</a>. In 1879 Chile recanted its recognition of Bolivian sovereignty citing a Bolivian breach of the <a>latest boundary treaty</a>. Antofagasta was captured by Chile in February 14 1879 triggering the <a>War of the Pacific</a> (1879–83). Chilean sovereignty was officially recognised by Bolivia under the terms of the 1904 <a>Treaty of Peace and Friendship</a>.

</p>
<p>
The city of Antofagasta is closely linked to mining activity, being a port and the chief service hub for one of Chile's major mining areas. While <a>silver</a> and <a>saltpeter</a> mining have been historically important for Antofagasta, since the mid-19th century <a>copper mining</a> is by far the most important mining activity for Antofagasta fueling a steady growth in the areas of construction, retail, hotel accommodations, population growth, and a remarkable skyline development until the end of the <a>2000s commodities boom</a> in 2013.

</p>
<p>
Antofagasta has the highest <a>GDP per capita</a> of Chile, US$37,000 and the 3rd place for <a>Human Development Index</a> just after <a>Metropolitana de Santiago Region</a> and <a>Magallanes and Antártica Chilena Region</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>
Currently there are several theories to explain the origin of the name Antofagasta.  A clear consensus regarding the true origin of the word has not yet been determined.

</p>
<p>
It is probably a compound word that comes from the southern <a>Cacan</a><i>anto</i>  (or <i>hattun</i>, which means "big"), <i>faya</i> (or <i>haya</i>, which means "<a>dry lake</a>") and <i>gasta</i> (meaning "<a>pueblo</a>"), being a <a>toponymy</a> meaning "Town of the great salt lake".

</p>
<p>
According to other theories, it may be a compound word from the <a>Quechua</a> word <i>anta</i> (meaning "copper") and <i>Pakay</i> (meaning "hidden"), being a toponymy meaning "Copper Cache"; it could also be related to the <a>Chango language</a>, <i>Antofagasti</i> (meaning "Sun Gate"), what the changos called the current natural monument "<a>La Portada</a>". However, it is said the name Antofagasta is due to a decision by Manuel <a>Mariano Melgarejo</a>, who renamed the city in honor of a <i><a>estancia</a></i> that he had in <a>Antofagasta de la Sierra</a>, in 1870.

</p>
<p>
In Chile, Antofagasta is known as <i>La Perla del Norte</i> ("The Pearl of the North"), for its historical and economic importance.

</p>

<p>
<a>Bolivia</a> created the "Departamento del Litoral", during the government of <a>Andrés de Santa Cruz</a>, in 1837, which was divided into two provinces: <i>La Mar</i> (with capital Cobija) and <i>Atacama</i> (with its capital in <a>San Pedro de Atacama</a>) and 1868, Antofagasta would be the capital of the <a>province of Mejillones</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
On 18 September 1866, José Santos Ossa and Francisco Puelma achieved the award of the concession of <a>nitrate</a> lands, following a request taken to the <a>Bolivian government</a>. The exploring of the Chilean miners found rich deposits of <a>saltpeter</a> (<a>nitratine</a>) in the field of <a>Salar del Carmen</a>, to the east of the present Antofagasta. Agreed to form the "<i>Sociedad Exploradora del Desierto de Atacama</i>" (Explorer Society of Atacama Desert). After the formation of the company, began to fill with what was called "<i>La Chimba</i>". On 19 March 1868, the "Melbourne Clark Company" was established, after the integration of Chilean and British capital.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
After the tsunami in <a>Iquique</a> and the <a>1868 Arica earthquake</a>, it was necessary to give legal recognition to the <i>Chimba</i> as a mining town. On 27 August 1868, Bolivia's President <a>Mariano Melgarejo</a> instructed the Prefect of the Department of Litoral, the official founding of <i>La Chimba</i>, in the area bounded by the commissioners and Jose Santos Hilario Ruiz Prada.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> On 22 October 1868, the population was officially established and the port under the name <i>La Chimba</i>, as stated in the foundation charter. Later the city was renamed <i>Antofagasta</i>. The first official map of the population and the port of Antofagasta was designed by Jose Santos Prada on 14 September 1869. This document set out the grounds of the Melbourne Clark Company, plus 17 blocks and the Main Square.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
On 8 May 1872, Antofagasta was designated by the <a>Bolivian Government</a> as <i>Puerto Mayor</i>, opening trade worldwide. Next year, on 25 January 1872, following a session led by the prefect of the <a>Provincial Department of Mejillones</a>, Manuel Buitrago founded the Municipality of Antofagasta under Bolivian Law of Municipalities, which formed the body of "Municipal Agents", composed of two Germans, one Englishman and six Chileans.

</p>
<p>
On 27 November 1873, the "Compañía de Salitres y Ferrocarril de Antofagasta" (CSFA), a Chilean mining company, signed a contract with the government of Bolivia, in which taxes were removed from mineral exploitation for 15 years. This contract was not ratified by the Congress of Bolivia, which was then analyzed negotiations with Chile.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>

<p>
In 1873 Bolivia signed a <a>secret treaty of defensive alliance</a> with Peru. This would be used as an argument 5 years later in Chile, when it unleashed the <a>War of the Pacific</a>. The secret alliance forbade Bolivia from signing a border treaty with Chile, without consulting with <a>Peru</a>. However, in 1874 Chile and Bolivia signed a border treaty, which replaced the previous <a>treaty of 1866</a>. One of its points was not to impose new taxes on individuals, industries and Chilean capital for 25 years.

</p>
<p>
For Bolivia, the contract of 1873 between the government and CSFA was not yet in force, because, according to the Bolivian constitution, all contracts with the Bolivian government had to be approved by the congress.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the Bolivian version of events, the contract with the saltpeter company was incomplete so the congress, to approve the contract, decided to enforce a tax of 10 cents, which did not violate <a>the treaty of 1874</a>, since the contract was not yet in force at that date.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> Bolivia suspended the tax in deference to the government of Chile, but following a note from the Chilean foreign minister, it reactivated the tax law, then cancelled and closed the "Compañía de Salitres". Faced with a looming conflict with Chile, Bolivia decided to claim support under the agreement signed with Peru, and the treaty became effective with the Chilean occupation of Antofagasta, on 14 February 1879.

</p>
<p>
According to the Chilean version of events, the tax of 10 cents violated the treaty of 1874 since according to this, new taxes should not have been imposed on Chilean companies operating in Bolivia. At the breaking of the boundary treaty by Bolivia, and the cancellation of the contract of the CSFA, Chile seized Antofagasta, then in Bolivian territory, whose sovereignty had been ratified before 1866. After the war, <a>a pact of truce</a> was signed between Bolivia and Chile in 1884, which stated that the territory between the <a>Loa River</a> and parallel 23 would be under the administration of Chile, while Bolivia would be allowed access to the ports of <a>Arica</a> and Antofagasta. However, both treaties left outstanding issues to be clarified in two subsequent treaties, the <i><a>Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Bolivia</a></i> in 1904 and the 1929 <i><a>Treaty of Lima</a></i> in Peru.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
The <i>Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Chile and Bolivia</i>, signed on 20 October 1904, and promulgated on 21 March 1905, established in perpetuity border between Chile and Bolivia. The territory of Antofagasta was definitely within Chile's borders but in return Chile agreed to build a railroad that would link the cities of <a>Arica</a> and <a>La Paz</a>, Bolivia was granted free movement of commerce through Chilean territory.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1905, the city of Antofagasta began construction of sewers, because of existing outbreaks of <a>bubonic</a> plague and <a>smallpox</a>. The same year was ordered, so unsatisfactory, the closure of public places, in order to prevent the spread of disease.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
On 1 February 1906, the railway <a>workers union</a> of the "<a>Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia</a>" called for a readjustment of working hours, which was rejected. For this reason, on 6 February, from more than 3,000 workers went on strike, marching in protest to the Plaza Colon (main square). The army opened fire on protesters, killing 58 people. The event is known as the "Massacre of Plaza Colon".<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1912, the British community (<i>La Colonia Britanica</i>) erected a clock tower, replicating <a>Big Ben</a>, in Plaza Colón to celebrate the republic's centenary.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>

<p>
In 1937, the Municipality of Antofagasta made a national call for the composition of Antofagasta's anthem. Antonio Rendic, famous physician and poet of the city, and Juan Bautista Quagliotto, musician, claimed the right to compose the lyrics and music, respectively. On 2 February 1948, the Mayor Juan de Dios Carmona proposed in an open session in the hall of the Municipality, the establishment of <i>14 February</i> as the day of the celebration of Antofagasta, despite not being the real founding date. Later, after the popular approval, the council approved the date.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1956 the Universidad del Norte (now the <a>Catholic University of the North</a>) was founded, due to support from the <a>Catholic University of Valparaíso</a>. On 9 October, of the same year began the negotiations for the creation of the "Centro Universitario Zona Norte" (University Center North Zone), part of the <a>University of Chile</a>. In 1968 the Antofagasta center of the <a>University of Chile</a> was inaugurated, after a university reform agreement which meant the autonomy of the <i>University Center North Zone</i>. Finally in 1981, merging the offices of the <a>University of Chile</a> and <i>Technical State University</i>, giving rise to the <a>University of Antofagasta</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
On 18 June 1991, a mudslide devastated much of the city, undermining land, damaged 2,464 houses and destroyed 493 buildings. Material damage was estimated at approximately $70,000,000. The disaster left 92 dead, 16 missing and about 20,000 homeless.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> On 30 July 1995, the city was hit by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the <a>Richter Scale</a>, with an intensity VII to VIII on the <a>Mercalli Scale</a>. Although it took a toll of three deaths and a hundred injuries, structural damage was minor for the magnitude of the event.

The construction industry has had remarkable growth as seen in the many recently constructed tall buildings, the extension of the urban area to the north of the city, and different urban projects as the renovation of the entire Costanera Avenue, and walkways of the city center. In <a>economic development</a>, settled many retail chains and supermarkets as well as various high-quality hotel chains, which promoted <a>business tourism</a> to attract capital and trading partners in mining and port activity.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Similarly, the city was awarded the installation of the <i>Casino Enjoy Antofagasta</i>.

</p>
<p>
In the municipal elections of 2008, the first female mayor of the city, Dra. Marcela Hernando, was elected, who retired from her political party to run as an independent. This allowed her to have diverse support from all sectors of the population of Antofagasta.

</p>
<p>
Experts estimated in 2010 that by 2020 the city would reach a population of 500,000.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>

<p>
The urban area of Antofagasta begins abruptly, breaking the monotony of the <a>desert</a> and is located in the coastal plains, south of <a>Mejillones Peninsula</a> and north of "<i>Cerro Coloso</i>". The <a>Tropic of Capricorn</a> passes in the north of the city, outside the urban area, which is located the <a>Cerro Moreno International Airport</a>. The <a>Tropic of Capricorn Monument</a> was opened on 21 December 2000 in celebration of this. Designed by the architect Eleonora Roman, it was created to point the Tropic of Capricorn and to work as a Solar Calendar.

</p>
<p>
Antofagasta was declared a partial common in the border area 20 July 1999, by Supreme Decree No. 1166 of the <a>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>

<p>
The town of Antofagasta has a <a>cold desert climate</a> (<a>Köppen</a><i>BWk</i> ) with abundant sunshine and strong maritime influence.

</p>
<p>
The marked aridity and <a>water scarcity</a> are regulated by the <a>Humboldt Current</a>, addition to the high humidity and morning fog known as "Camanchaca". Furthermore, the <a>Pacific anticyclone</a> generates winds from the south and southwest.

</p>
<p>
The average annual temperature is 16.8 °C (62.2 °F).<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> The average daily low temperature in the warmest month, January, is 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) while the average daily high temperature is 23.2 °C (73.8 °F).<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> The coldest month, July, sees an average low temperature of 11.8 °C (53.2 °F) and an average high temperature of 16.5 °C (61.7 °F).<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> The highest temperature recorded is 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) in January 1998 and the lowest recorded is 3.0 °C (37.4 °F) in September 1978.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Atacama Desert coast is subject to a climate of extreme aridity, and therefore generates a low average annual rainfall of 3.4 mm (0.13 in) (1970–2000), and the Town of Antofagasta itself receives an annual average of less than 0.1 mm (0.00 in) of rainfall per year, earning it the record as the world's driest town.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> However, the sporadic occurrence of heavy rainfall, together with the geomorphologic situation of the city, make it susceptible to be affected by mud flows and landslides. Between 1916 and 1999, the city was affected by floods or landslides on seven occasions: 1925, 1930, twice in 1940, 1982, 1987 and 1991, of which the most important episodes in 1940 and 1991.
