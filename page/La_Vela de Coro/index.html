<b>La Vela de Coro</b> is the port of <a>Coro</a>, Venezuela. Coro and its port form a conurbation, although Coro is in the municipality of <a>Miranda</a> and La Vela is in a separate municipality, <a>Colina</a>.
The twin settlements were founded by the Spanish in the 16th century. 

</p>
<p>
Like Coro, La Vela is notable for its architecture. In 1993 a <a>World Heritage Site</a> was designated to protect historic districts of both settlements. Because of its proximity to the <a>Dutch Caribbean</a>, the local architecture reflects <a>Dutch</a> influences as well as the <a>Spanish Colonial</a> inheritance which is typical of Venezuela.

<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
During the reign of <a>Charles V</a>, Coro became the first <a>German colony in the Americas</a>. In 1528 Charles V, who was in debt to German bankers, gave a charter to the <a>Welsers</a>, a banking family from Augsburg, to exploit the territory known as the <a>Venezuela Province</a>. <a>Bartholomeus VI. Welser</a> was beheaded in 1546 and the charter was revoked.

<h3 id="La_Vela%20and%20the%20Venezuelan%20flag">La Vela and the Venezuelan flag</h3>
<p>
La Vela played an important role in the history of the <a>Flag of Venezuela</a>. The first version of this <a>tricolour flag</a> was unfurled on Venezuelan soil at La Vela when <a>Francisco de Miranda</a> landed there in August 1806.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> Miranda was seeking independence from Spain for its American colonies. He and his troops marched on and captured Coro, but found no support from the city residents. Having only a couple of hundred soldiers, Miranda had to withdraw when the Spanish began moving their forces to confront him.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> Miranda sailed to <a>Trinidad</a>, then a British colony, where his <a>corvette</a> the "Leander" was auctioned to meet some of the costs of the expedition.

</p>
<p>
While the expedition was a failure in military terms, it is celebrated in connection with the flag.
Previously, in Venezuela "Flag Day" was celebrated on March 12 marking the flag's unfurling in <a>Haiti</a> (when Miranda was on his way to Venezuela). In 2006, it was designated August 3 in honor of the disembarkation of Miranda in La Vela de Coro in 1806.
A walkway, the Paseo "Generalísimo Francisco de Miranda", was constructed to mark the 200th anniversary of Miranda's landing.

The two urban areas of "Coro and its port" cover a total of 18.40 ha; 7.85 ha in Coro, and 10.55 ha in the Port of La Vela. As at 2019 the boundaries of the buffer zones are under discussion.

Buildings of interest in La Vela include:

<ul><li>the old <i>aduana</i> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Custom_house">customs house</a>)</li><li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bas%C3%ADlica_de_Nuestra_Se%C3%B1ora_de_Guadalupe_(Coro)&action=edit&redlink=1">Basílica de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe (Coro)</a><span> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas%C3%ADlica_de_Nuestra_Se%C3%B1ora_de_Guadalupe_(Coro)">es</a>]</span>)</li></ul>
<h3 id="Threats_to%20the%20site">Threats to the site</h3>
<p>
The buildings of La Vela include examples of traditional mud building techniques, a type of construction which often poses conservation problems, because of, for example, its vulnerability to water damage and other natural impacts.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> The climate in this region of Venezuela is classed as <a>semi-arid</a>, but the site was damaged by heavy rain in 2004/2005. There were also concerns about the site being affected by inappropriate development. These factors resulted in its inclusion on the list of <a>World Heritage in Danger</a> in 2005. As at 2019 it is still on the list, although <a>UNESCO</a> has acknowledged progress with corrective measures.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
Among other recommendations, UNESCO has requested the implementation of a comprehensive drainage plan.
Also, modifications to the buffer zone at La Vela have been proposed. These would reduce the overall area protected, but would include a coastal walk to protect the visual relationship of the property with the coastline.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
