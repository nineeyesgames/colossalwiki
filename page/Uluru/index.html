It lies 335 km (208 mi) southwest of the nearest large town: <a>Alice Springs</a>.

</p>
<p>
Uluru is sacred to the <a>Pitjantjatjara</a>, the <a>Aboriginal people</a> of the area, known as the <a>Aṉangu</a>. The area around the formation is home to an abundance of springs, <a>waterholes</a>, rock caves, and <a>ancient paintings</a>. Uluru is listed as a <a>UNESCO</a><a>World Heritage Site</a> . Uluru and <a>Kata Tjuta</a>, also known as the Olgas, are the two major features of the <a>Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park</a>.

</p>
<p>
Uluru is one of Australia's most recognisable natural <a>landmarks</a> and has been a popular destination for tourists since the late 1930s. It is also one of the most important indigenous sites in Australia.

<h2 id="Name">Name</h2>
<p>
The local <a>Aṉangu</a>, the <a>Pitjantjatjara</a> people, call the landmark <i>Uluṟu</i> (<small>Pitjantjatjara: </small><span><a>[ʊlʊɻʊ]</a></span>). This word is a <a>proper noun</a>, with no further particular meaning in the <a>Pitjantjatjara dialect</a>, although it is used as a local family name by the senior traditional owners of Uluru.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 19 July 1873, the <a>surveyor</a><a>William Gosse</a>  sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then <a>Chief Secretary of South Australia</a>, <a>Sir Henry Ayers</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> Since then, both names have been used.

</p>
<p>
In 1993, a <a>dual naming</a> policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name (in the <a>Pitjantjatjara</a>, <a>Yankunytjatjara</a> and other local languages) and the English name. On 15 December 1993, it was renamed "Ayers Rock / Uluru" and became the first official dual-named feature in the Northern Territory. The order of the dual names was officially reversed to "Uluru / Ayers Rock" on 6 November 2002 following a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>
<p>
The <a>sandstone</a> formation stands 348 m (1,142 ft) high, rising 863 m (2,831 ft) above sea level with most of its bulk lying underground, and has a total perimeter of 9.4 km (5.8 mi).<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> Both Uluru and the nearby <a>Kata Tjuta</a> formation have great cultural significance for the local Aṉangu people, the traditional inhabitants of the area, who lead walking tours to inform visitors about the bush, food, local flora and fauna, and the Aboriginal dreamtime stories of the area.

</p>
<p>
Uluru is also very notable for appearing to change colour at different times of the day and year, most notably, when it glows red at dawn and sunset.

</p>
<p>
Kata Tjuta, also called Mount Olga or the Olgas, lies 25 km (16 mi) west of Uluru. Special viewing areas with road access and parking have been constructed to give tourists the best views of both sites at dawn and dusk.

<p>
Uluru is an <a>inselberg</a>, meaning "island mountain".<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> An inselberg is a prominent isolated residual knob or hill that rises abruptly from and is surrounded by extensive and relatively flat erosion lowlands in a hot, dry region.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> Uluru is also often referred to as a <a>monolith</a>, although this is an ambiguous term that is generally avoided by geologists.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The remarkable feature of Uluru is its homogeneity and lack of <a>jointing</a> and parting at <a>bedding</a> surfaces, leading to the lack of development of <a>scree</a> slopes and soil. These characteristics led to its survival, while the surrounding rocks were eroded.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of mapping and describing the geological history of the area, geologists refer to the rock <a>strata</a> making up Uluru as the Mutitjulu <a>Arkose</a>, and it is one of many <a>sedimentary formations</a> filling the <a>Amadeus Basin</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Composition">Composition</h3>
<p>
Uluru is dominantly composed of coarse-grained <a>arkose</a> (a type of sandstone characterised by an abundance of <a>feldspar</a>) and some <a>conglomerate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Average composition is 50% feldspar, 25–35% <a>quartz</a> and up to 25% rock fragments; most feldspar is <a>K-feldspar</a> with only minor <a>plagioclase</a> as <a>subrounded</a> grains and highly altered inclusions within K-feldspar.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The grains are typically 2–4 millimetres (0.079–0.157 in) in diameter, and are angular to subangular; the finer sandstone is <a>well sorted</a>, with sorting decreasing with increasing <a>grain size</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The rock fragments include subrounded <a>basalt</a>, invariably replaced to various degrees by <a>chlorite</a> and <a>epidote</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The minerals present suggest derivation from a predominantly <a>granite</a> source, similar to the <a>Musgrave Block</a> exposed to the south.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> When relatively fresh, the rock has a grey colour, but weathering of iron-bearing minerals by the process of <a>oxidation</a> gives the outer surface layer of rock a red-brown rusty colour.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Features related to deposition of the sediment include <a>cross-bedding</a> and <a>ripples</a>, analysis of which indicated deposition from broad shallow high energy <a>fluvial</a> channels and sheet flooding, typical of <a>alluvial fans</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Age_and%20origin">Age and origin</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/UluruRockWater.jpg/220px-UluruRockWater.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to be of about the same age as the <a>conglomerate</a> at <a>Kata Tjuta</a>, and to have a similar origin despite the rock type being different, but it is younger than the rocks exposed to the east at <a>Mount Conner</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> and unrelated to them. The strata at Uluru are nearly vertical, <a>dipping</a> to the south west at 85°, and have an exposed thickness of at least 2,400 m (7,900 ft). The strata dip below the surrounding plain and no doubt extend well beyond Uluru in the subsurface, but the extent is not known.

</p>
<p>
The rock was originally sand, deposited as part of an extensive <a>alluvial fan</a> that extended out from the ancestors of the <a>Musgrave</a>, Mann and <a>Petermann Ranges</a> to the south and west, but separate from a nearby fan that deposited the sand, pebbles and cobbles that now make up Kata Tjuta.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The similar mineral composition of the Mutitjulu Arkose and the <a>granite</a> ranges to the south is now explained. The ancestors of the ranges to the south were once much larger than the eroded remnants we see today. They were thrust up during a <a>mountain building</a> episode referred to as the <a>Petermann Orogeny</a> that took place in late <a>Neoproterozoic</a> to early <a>Cambrian</a> times (550–530 <a>Ma</a>), and thus the Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to have been deposited at about the same time.

</p>
<p>
The arkose <a>sandstone</a> which makes up the formation is composed of grains that show little sorting based on grain size, exhibit very little rounding and the <a>feldspars</a> in the rock are relatively fresh in appearance. This lack of sorting and grain rounding is typical of arkosic sandstones and is indicative of relatively rapid erosion from the granites of the growing mountains to the south. The layers of sand were nearly horizontal when deposited, but were tilted to their near vertical position during a later episode of mountain building, possibly the <a>Alice Springs Orogeny</a> of <a>Palaeozoic</a> age (400–300 <a>Ma</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>

<p>
Historically, 46 species of native <a>mammals</a> are known to have been living near Uluru; according to recent surveys there are currently 21. Aṉangu acknowledge that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape. Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as <a>malleefowl</a>, <a>common brushtail possum</a>, <a>rufous hare-wallaby</a> or mala, <a>bilby</a>, <a>burrowing bettong</a>, and the <a>black-flanked rock-wallaby</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>mulgara</a> is mostly restricted to the transitional sand plain area, a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru to the northern boundary of the park and into Ayers Rock Resort. This area also contains the <a>marsupial mole</a>, <a>woma python</a>, and <a>great desert skink</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>bat</a> population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta. Most of the bats forage for aerial <a>prey</a> within 100 m (330 ft) or so from the rock face. The park has a very rich <a>reptile</a> fauna of high conservation significance, with 73 species having been reliably recorded. Four species of <a>frogs</a> are <a>abundant</a> at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains. The great desert skink is listed as vulnerable.

</p>
<p>
Aṉangu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on Aṉangu land elsewhere. Hunting is largely confined to the <a>red kangaroo</a>, <a>bush turkey</a>, <a>emu</a>, and <a>lizards</a> such as the <a>sand goanna</a> and <a>perentie</a>.

</p>
<p>
Of the 27 mammal species found in the park, six are introduced: the <a>house mouse</a>, <a>camel</a>, <a>fox</a>, cat, dog, and <a>rabbit</a>. These species are distributed throughout the park, but their densities are greatest near the rich water run-off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta.

</p>
<p>
Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park <a>flora</a> represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia. A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region. Many rare and <a>endemic</a> plants are found in the park.

</p>
<p>
The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall. Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce. Plants are an important part of <i><a>Tjukurpa</a></i>, and ceremonies are held for each of the major plant foods. Many plants are associated with <a>ancestral</a> beings.

</p>
<p>
Flora in Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park can be broken into these categories:

</p>
<ul><li><i>Punu</i> – trees</li><li><i>Puti</i> – shrubs</li><li><i>Tjulpun-tjulpunpa</i> – flowers</li><li><i>Ukiri</i> – grasses</li></ul>
<p>
Trees such as the <a>mulga</a> and <a>centralian bloodwood</a> are used to make tools such as spearheads, <a>boomerangs</a>, and bowls. The red <a>sap</a> of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds.

</p>
<p>
Several rare and endangered species are found in the park. Most of them, like <a>adder's tongue ferns</a>, are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the formation, which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion.

</p>
<p>
Since the first Europeans arrived, 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park, representing about 6.4% of the total park flora. Some, such as perennial buffel grass (<i><a>Cenchrus ciliaris</a></i>), were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion. It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water- and nutrient-rich drainage lines. A few others, such as burrgrass, were brought in accidentally, carried on cars and people.

</p>
<h2 id="Climate_and%20five%20seasons">Climate and five seasons</h2>
<p>
The park has a hot desert climate and receives an average rainfall of 284.6 mm (11.2 in) per year.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> The average high temperature in summer (December–January) is 37.8 °C (100.0 °F), and the average low temperature in winter (June–July) is 4.7 °C (40.5 °F). Temperature extremes in the park have been recorded at 46 °C (115 °F) during summer and −5 °C (23 °F) during winter. <a>UV</a> levels are extreme between October and March, averaging between 11 and 15 on the <a>UV index</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>
According to the Aṉangu, traditional landowners of Uluru:<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are a number of differing accounts given, by outsiders, of Aboriginal ancestral stories for the origins of Uluru and its many cracks and fissures. One such account, taken from Robert Layton's (1989) <i>Uluru: An Aboriginal history of Ayers Rock</i>,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> reads as follows:

</p>
<p>
Two other accounts are given in Norbert Brockman's (1997) <i>Encyclopedia of Sacred Places</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The first tells of serpent beings who waged many wars around Uluru, scarring the rock. The second tells of two tribes of ancestral spirits who were invited to a feast, but were distracted by the beautiful Sleepy Lizard Women and did not show up. In response, the angry hosts sang evil into a mud sculpture that came to life as the dingo. There followed a great battle, which ended in the deaths of the leaders of both tribes. The earth itself rose up in grief at the bloodshed, becoming Uluru.

</p>
<p>
The Commonwealth Department of Environment's webpage advises:<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
It is sometimes reported that those who take rocks from the formation will be cursed and suffer misfortune. There have been many instances where people who removed such rocks attempted to mail them back to various agencies in an attempt to remove the perceived curse.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>

Archaeological findings to the east and west indicate that humans settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="European_arrival%20(1870s)">European arrival (1870s)</h3>
<p>
Europeans arrived in the Australian <a>Western Desert</a> in the 1870s. Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the <a>Australian Overland Telegraph Line</a>. In separate expeditions, <a>Ernest Giles</a> and <a>William Gosse</a> were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near <a>Kings Canyon</a> and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers' Rock, in honour of the <a>Chief Secretary of South Australia</a>, Sir <a>Henry Ayers</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="European_colonisation">European colonisation</h3>
<p>
Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for <a>pastoralism</a>. In the late 19th century, pastoralists attempted to establish themselves in areas adjoining the Southwestern/Petermann Reserve and interaction between Aṉangu and white people became more frequent and more violent. Due to the effects of grazing and drought, bush food stores became depleted. Competition for these resources created conflict between the two groups, resulting in more frequent police patrols. Later, during the depression in the 1930s, Aṉangu became involved in <a>dingo</a> scalping with 'doggers' who introduced the Aṉangu to European foods and ways.

<p>
Between 1918 and 1921, large adjoining areas of South Australia, Western Australia, and the <a>Northern Territory</a> were declared as <a>Aboriginal reserves</a>, government-run settlements where the Aboriginal people were forced to live. In 1920, part of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve (commonly known as the South-Western or Petermann Reserve) by the Australian government under the <i><a>Aboriginals Ordinance 1918</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Tourism_(1936%E2%80%931960s)">Tourism (1936–1960s)</h3>
<p>
The first tourists arrived in the Uluru area in 1936. Permanent European settlement of the area began in the 1940s under Aboriginal welfare policy and to promote tourism at Uluru. This increased tourism prompted the formation of the first vehicular tracks in 1948 and tour bus services began early in the 1950s. In 1958, the area that would become the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park was excised from the Petermann Reserve; it was placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board and named the Ayers Rock–Mount Olga National Park. The first <a>ranger</a> was Bill Harney, a well-recognised central Australian figure.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> By 1959, the first motel leases had been granted and Eddie Connellan had constructed an airstrip close to the northern side of Uluru.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> Following a 1963 suggestion from the Northern Territory Reserves Board, a chain was laid to assist tourists in climbing the landmark.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> The chain was removed in 2019.

</p>
<h3 id="Aboriginal_ownership%20since%201985">Aboriginal ownership since 1985</h3>
<p>
On 26 October 1985, the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru to the local Pitjantjatjara people, with one of the conditions being that the Aṉangu would lease it back to the National Parks and Wildlife agency for 99 years and that it would be jointly managed. An agreement originally made between the community and Prime Minister <a>Bob Hawke</a> that the climb to the top by tourists would be stopped was later broken.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Aboriginal community of <a>Mutitjulu</a>, with a population of approximately 300, is located near the eastern end of Uluru. From Uluru it is 17 km (11 mi) by road to the tourist town of <a>Yulara</a>, population 3,000, which is situated just outside the national park.

</p>
<p>
On 8 October 2009, the Talinguru Nyakuntjaku viewing area opened to public visitation. The <span><a>A$</a>21 million</span> project about 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) on the east side of Uluru involved design and construction supervision by the Aṉangu traditional owners, with 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) of roads and 1.6 kilometres (1 mi) of walking trails being built for the area.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>

<p>
The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts. It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation-related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park. In 1975, a reservation of 104 square kilometres (40 sq mi) of land beyond the park's northern boundary, 15 kilometres (9 mi) from Uluru, was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated <a>airport</a>, to be known as <a>Yulara</a>. The camp ground within the park was closed in 1983 and the motels closed in late 1984, coinciding with the opening of the Yulara resort. In 1992, the majority interest in the Yulara resort held by the Northern Territory Government was sold and the resort was renamed Ayers Rock Resort.

</p>
<p>
Since the park was listed as a <a>World Heritage Site</a>, annual visitor numbers rose to over 400,000 visitors by the year 2000.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits. It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs.

<p>
On 11 December 1983, the Prime Minister of Australia, <a>Bob Hawke</a>, promised to hand back the land title to the Aṉangu traditional custodians and caretakers and agreed to the community's 10-point plan which included forbidding the climbing of Uluru. The government, however, set access to climb Uluru and a 99-year lease, instead of the previously agreed upon 50-year lease, as conditions before the title was officially given back to the Aṉangu on 26 October 1985.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The local Aṉangu do not climb Uluru because of its great spiritual significance. They request that visitors do not climb the rock, partly due to the path crossing a sacred traditional <a>Dreamtime</a><a>track</a> , and also due to a sense of responsibility for the safety of visitors. Until October 2019, the visitors guide said "the climb is not prohibited, but we prefer that, as a guest on Aṉangu land, you will choose to respect our law and culture by not climbing."<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to a 2010 publication, just over one-third of all visitors to the park climbed Uluru; a high percentage of these were children.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> A chain handhold added in 1964 and extended in 1976 made the hour-long climb easier,<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> but it remained a steep, 800 m (0.5 mi) hike to the top, where it can be quite windy.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> It was recommended that individuals drink plenty of water while climbing, and that those who were <a>unfit</a>, or who suffered from <a>vertigo</a> or medical conditions restricting exercise, did not attempt it. Climbing Uluru was generally closed to the public when high winds were present at the top. There were at least 37 deaths relating to recreational climbing since such incidents began being recorded.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> About one-sixth of visitors made the climb between 2011 and 2015.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The traditional owners of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park (Nguraritja) and the Federal Government's <a>Director of National Parks</a> share decision-making on the management of Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park. Under their joint Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park Management Plan 2010–20, issued by the Director of National Parks under the <i><a>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a></i>, clause 6.3.3 provides that the Director and the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa Board of Management should work towards closure of the climb and, additionally, that it was to be closed upon any of three conditions being met: there were "adequate new visitor experiences", less than 20 per cent of visitors made the climb, or the "critical factors" in decisions to visit were "cultural and natural experiences".<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> Despite cogent evidence that the second condition was met by July 2013, the climb remained open.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Several controversial incidents on top of Uluru in 2010, including a <a>striptease</a>, golfing, and nudity, led to renewed calls for banning the climb.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> On 1 November 2017, the Uluṟu–Kata Tjuṯa National Park board voted unanimously to prohibit climbing Uluru.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> As a result, there was a surge in climbers and visitors after the ban was announced.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> The ban took effect on the 26 October 2019, and the chain was then removed.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>

<p>
The Aṉangu request that visitors do not photograph certain sections of Uluru, for reasons related to traditional <i><a>Tjukurpa</a></i> (Dreaming) beliefs. These areas are the sites of gender-linked <a>rituals or ceremonies</a> and are forbidden ground for Aṉangu of the opposite sex to those participating in the rituals in question. The photographic restriction is intended to prevent Aṉangu from inadvertently violating this <a>taboo</a> by encountering photographs of the forbidden sites in the outside world.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In September 2020, Parks Australia alerted Google Australia to the user-generated images from the Uluru summit that have been posted on the Google Maps platform and requested that the content be removed in accordance with the wishes of Aṉangu, Uluru's traditional owners, and the national park's Film and Photography Guidelines. Google agreed to the request.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> Currently, the only photos of Uluru are photos at the surface.

<h3 id="Waterfalls">Waterfalls</h3>
<p>
During heavy rain, waterfalls cascade down the sides of Uluru, a rare phenomenon that only 1% of all tourists get to see.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> Large rainfall events occurred in 2016<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> and the summer of 2020-21.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
