<b>Maine</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>m</span><span>eÉª</span><span>n</span></span>/</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span></span>) is a <a>state</a> in the <a>New England</a> region of the <a>United States</a>, bordered by <a>New Hampshire</a> to the west; the <a>Gulf of Maine</a> to the southeast; and the <a>Canadian provinces</a> of <a>New Brunswick</a> and <a>Quebec</a> to the northeast and northwest, respectively. Maine is the <a>12th-smallest by area</a>, the <a>9th-least populous</a>, the <a>13th-least densely populated</a>, and the most rural<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> of the <a>50 U.S. states</a>. It is also the <a>northeasternmost</a> among the <a>contiguous United States</a>, the northernmost state east of the <a>Great Lakes</a>, the only state whose name consists of a single syllable, and the only state to border only one other US state. The most populous city in Maine is <a>Portland</a>, while its capital is <a>Augusta</a>.

</p>
<p>
Maine has traditionally been known for its jagged, rocky <a>Atlantic Ocean</a> and bayshore coastlines; smoothly contoured mountains; heavily forested interior; picturesque waterways; and its <a>wild lowbush blueberries</a> and <a>seafood</a> cuisine, especially <a>lobster</a> and <a>clams</a>. In more recent years, coastal and <a>Down East Maine</a>, especially in <a>the vicinity of Portland</a>, have emerged as an important center for the <a>creative economy</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> which is also bringing <a>gentrification</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
For thousands of years after the glaciers retreated during the last <a>Ice Age</a>, <a>indigenous peoples</a> were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine. At the time of European arrival, several <a>Algonquian</a>-speaking peoples inhabited the area. The first European settlement in the area was by the French in 1604 on <a>Saint Croix Island</a>, founded by <a>Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons</a>. The first English settlement was the short-lived <a>Popham Colony</a>, established by the <a>Plymouth Company</a> in 1607. A number of English settlements were established along the coast of Maine in the 1620s, although the rugged climate and conflict with the local <a>indigenous people</a> caused many to fail.

</p>
<p>
As Maine entered the 18th century, only a half dozen European settlements had survived. <a>Loyalist</a> and <a>Patriot</a> forces contended for Maine's territory during the <a>American Revolution</a>. During the <a>War of 1812</a>, the largely undefended eastern region of Maine was occupied by British forces with the goal of annexing it to <a>Canada</a> via the <a>Colony of New Ireland</a>, but returned to the United States following failed British offensives on the northern border, mid-Atlantic and south which produced a <a>peace treaty</a> that restored the pre-war boundaries. Maine was part of the <a>Commonwealth of Massachusetts</a> until 1820 when it voted to secede from Massachusetts to become a separate state. On March 15, 1820, under the <a>Missouri Compromise</a>, it was <a>admitted to the Union</a> as the 23rd state.

<h2 id="Name">Name</h2>
<p>
There is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name "Maine", but the most likely is that early explorers named it after the former <a>province of Maine</a> in <a>France</a>. Whatever the origin, the name was fixed for English settlers in 1665 when the English King's Commissioners ordered that the "Province of Maine" be entered from then on in official records.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> The state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing Franco-American Day, which stated that the state was named after the former French province of Maine.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Other theories mention earlier places with similar names or claim it is a <a>nautical</a> reference to the mainland.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Captain John Smith, in his "Description of New England" (1614)<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> laments the lack of exploration: "Thus you may see, of this 2000. miles more then halfe is yet vnknowne to any purpose: no not so much as the borders of the Sea are yet certainly discouered. As for the goodnes and true substances of the Land, wee are for most part yet altogether ignorant of them, vnlesse it bee those parts about the Bay of Chisapeack and Sagadahock: but onely here and there wee touched or haue seene a little the edges of those large dominions, which doe stretch themselues into the Maine, God doth know how many thousand miles;" 
Note that his description of the mainland of North America is "the Maine". The word "main" was a frequent shorthand for the word "mainland" (as in "The Spanish Main")<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Attempts to uncover the history of the name of Maine began with James Sullivan's 1795 "History of the District of Maine." He made the unsubstantiated claim that the Province of Maine was a compliment to the queen of <a>Charles I</a>, <a>Henrietta Maria</a>, who once "owned" the Province of Maine in France. Maine historians quoted this until the 1845 biography of that queen by Agnes Strickland<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> established that she had no connection to the province; further, King Charles I married <a>Henrietta Maria</a> in 1625, three years after the name Maine first appeared on the charter.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> A new theory put forward by Carol B. Smith Fisher in 2002 postulated that <a>Sir Ferdinando Gorges</a> chose the name in 1622 to honor the village where his ancestors first lived in <a>England</a>, rather than the province in France. "MAINE" appears in the <a>Domesday Book</a> of 1086 in reference to the county of <a>Dorset</a>, which is today <a>Broadmayne</a>, just southeast of <a>Dorchester</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The view generally held among British place name scholars is that Mayne in <a>Dorset</a> is <a>Brythonic</a>, corresponding to modern <a>Welsh</a> "maen", plural "main" or "meini".<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Some early spellings are: MAINE 1086, MEINE 1200, MEINES 1204, MAYNE 1236.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> Today the village is known as <a>Broadmayne</a>, which is primitive Welsh or Brythonic, "main" meaning rock or stone, considered a reference to the many large <a>sarsen stones</a> still present around Little Mayne farm, half a mile northeast of Broadmayne village.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The first known record of the name appears in an August 10, 1622, land charter to <a>Sir Ferdinando Gorges</a> and Captain <a>John Mason</a>, English <a>Royal Navy</a> veterans, who were granted a large tract in present-day Maine that Mason and Gorges "intend to name the <a>Province of Maine</a>". Mason had served with the <a>Royal Navy</a> in the <a>Orkney Islands</a>, where the chief island is called <a>Mainland</a>, a possible name derivation for these English sailors.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> In 1623, the <a>English</a> naval captain <a>Christopher Levett</a>, exploring the <a>New England</a> coast, wrote: "The first place I set my foote upon in New England was the <a>Isle of Shoals</a>, being Ilands [<i><a>sic</a></i>] in the sea, above two Leagues from the Mayne."<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> Initially, several tracts along the coast of New England were referred to as <i>Main</i> or <i>Maine</i> (<a>cf.</a> the <a>Spanish Main</a>). A reconfirmed and enhanced April 3, 1639, charter, from England's <a>King Charles<span></span>I</a>, gave Sir Ferdinando Gorges increased powers over his new province and stated that it "shall forever hereafter, be called and named the PROVINCE OR COUNTIE OF MAINE, and not by any other name or names whatsoever<span></span>..."<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> Maine is the only <a>U.S. state</a> whose name has only one syllable.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>

<p>
The original inhabitants of the territory that is now Maine were Algonquian-speaking Wabanaki peoples, including the <a>Passamaquoddy</a>, <a>Maliseet</a>, <a>Penobscot</a>, <a>Androscoggin</a>, and Kennebec. During the later <a>King Philip's War</a>, many of these peoples would merge in one form or another to become the <a>Wabanaki Confederacy</a>, aiding the <a>Wampanoag</a> of <a>Massachusetts</a> and the <a>Mahican</a> of <a>New York</a>. Afterwards, many of these people were driven from their natural territories, but most of Maine's tribes continued, unchanged, until the <a>American Revolution</a>. Before this point, however, most of these people were considered separate nations. Many had adapted to living in permanent, <a>Iroquois</a>-inspired settlements, while those along the coast tended to be semi-nomadicâtraveling from settlement to settlement on a yearly cycle. They would usually winter inland and head to the coasts by summer.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>European contact</a> with what is now called Maine may have started around 1200 CE when <a>Norwegians</a> are believed to have interacted with the native <a>Penobscot</a> in present-day <a>Hancock County</a>, most likely through trade. If confirmed, this would make Maine the site of the earliest European landfall in the entire US. About 200 years earlier, from the settlements in <a>Iceland</a> and <a>Greenland</a>, Norwegians <a>first identified America</a> and <a>attempted to settle</a> areas such as <a>Newfoundland</a>, but failed to establish a permanent settlement. Archeological evidence suggests that <a>Norwegians</a> in Greenland returned to North America for several <a>centuries</a> after the initial discovery to trade and collect timber, with the most relevant evidence being the <a>Maine Penny</a>, an 11th-century Norwegian coin found at a Native American dig site in 1954.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The first European confirmed settlement in modern-day Maine was in 1604 on <a>Saint Croix Island</a>, led by French explorer <a>Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Mons</a>. His party included <a>Samuel de Champlain</a>, noted as an explorer. The French named the entire area <a>Acadia</a>, including the portion that later became the state of Maine. The <a>Plymouth Company</a> established the first English settlement in Maine at the <a>Popham Colony</a> in 1607, the same year as the settlement at <a>Jamestown, Virginia</a>. The Popham colonists returned to <a>Britain</a> after 14 months.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The French established two <a>Jesuit</a> missions: one on <a>Penobscot Bay</a> in 1609, and the other on <a>Mount Desert Island</a> in 1613. The same year, <a>Claude de La Tour</a> established <a>Castine</a>. In 1625, <a>Charles de Saint-Ãtienne de la Tour</a> erected <a>Fort Pentagouet</a> to protect Castine. The coastal areas of eastern Maine first became the <a>Province of Maine</a> in a 1622 land patent. The part of western Maine north of the <a>Kennebec River</a> was more sparsely settled and was known in the 17th century as the <a>Territory of Sagadahock</a>. A second settlement was attempted in 1623 by English explorer and naval Captain <a>Christopher Levett</a> at a place called <a>York</a>, where he had been granted 6,000 acres (24Â km<sup>2</sup>) by <a>King Charles I</a> of England.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> It also failed.

</p>
<p>
The 1622 patent of the Province of Maine was split at the <a>Piscataqua River</a> into the <a>Province of New Hampshire</a> to the south and <a>New Somersetshire</a> to the north. A disputed 1630 patent split off the area around present-day Saco as <a>Lygonia</a>. Justifying its actions with a 1652 geographic survey that showed an overlapping patent, the <a>Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> had seized New Somersetshire and Lygonia by force by 1658. The <a>Territory of Sagadahock</a> between the <a>Kennebec River</a> and <a>St. Croix River</a> notionally became <a>Cornwall County, Province of New York</a> under a 1664 grant from <a>Charles II of England</a> to his <a>brother James</a>, at the time the <a>Duke of York</a>. Some of this land was claimed by <a>New France</a> as part of <a>Acadia</a>. All of the English settlements in the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the Province of New York became part of the <a>Dominion of New England</a> in 1686. All of present-day Maine was unified as <a>York County, Massachusetts</a> under a 1691 royal patent for the <a>Province of Massachusetts Bay</a>.

</p>
<p>
Central Maine was formerly inhabited by the <a>Androscoggin tribe</a> of the <a>Abenaki nation</a>, also known as Arosaguntacook. They were driven out of the area in 1690 during <a>King William's War</a>. They were relocated to <a>St. Francis</a>, Canada, which was destroyed by <a>Rogers' Rangers</a> in 1759, and is now <a>Odanak</a>. The other Abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats, particularly during <a>Dummer's War</a>, with the capture of <a>Norridgewock</a> in 1724 and the defeat of the <a>Pequawket</a> in 1725, which significantly reduced their numbers. They finally withdrew to <a>Canada</a>, where they were settled at <a>BÃ©cancour</a> and <a>Sillery</a>, and later at St. Francis, along with other refugee tribes from the south.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Maine was much fought over by the <a>French</a>, English, and allied natives during the 17th and 18th centuries, who conducted raids against each other, taking captives for ransom or, in some cases, adoption by <a>Native American</a> tribes. A notable example was the early 1692 <a>Abenaki</a><a>raid on York</a> , where about 100 English settlers were killed and another estimated 80 taken hostage.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> The <a>Abenaki</a> took captives taken during raids of <a>Massachusetts</a> in <a>Queen Anne's War</a> of the early 1700s to <a>Kahnewake</a>, a Catholic <a>Mohawk</a> village near <a>Montreal</a>, where some were adopted and others ransomed.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After the British defeated the French in Acadia in the 1740s, the territory from the <a>Penobscot River</a> east fell under the nominal authority of the <a>Province of Nova Scotia</a>, and together with present-day New Brunswick formed the Nova Scotia county of <a>Sunbury</a>, with its court of general sessions at Campobello. American and British forces contended for Maine's territory during the American Revolution and the War of 1812, with the British occupying eastern Maine in both conflicts via the <a>Colony of New Ireland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> The territory of Maine was confirmed as part of Massachusetts when the United States was formed following the <a>Treaty of Paris</a> ending the revolution, although the final border with <a>British North America</a> was not established until the <a>WebsterâAshburton Treaty</a> of 1842.

</p>
<p>
Maine was physically separate from the rest of Massachusetts. Long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to Maine residents and their allies in Massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the Massachusetts Assembly on permitting Maine to secede; the vote failed. Secessionist sentiment in Maine was stoked during the <a>War of 1812</a> when Massachusetts pro-British merchants opposed the war and refused to defend Maine from British invaders. In 1819, Massachusetts agreed to permit secession, sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year.

</p>
<h3 id="Statehood_and%20Missouri%20Compromise">Statehood and Missouri Compromise</h3>
<p>
Formal secession from Massachusetts and admission of Maine as the 23rd state occurred on March 15, 1820, as part of the <a>Missouri Compromise</a>, which geographically limited the spread of <a>slavery</a> and enabled the admission to statehood of <a>Missouri</a> the following year, keeping a balance between <a>slave</a> and free states.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Maine's original state capital was Portland, Maine's largest city, until it was moved to the more central Augusta in 1832. The principal office of the <a>Maine Supreme Judicial Court</a> remains in Portland.

</p>
<p>
The <a>20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, under the command of Colonel <a>Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain</a>, prevented the <a>Union Army</a> from being flanked at <a>Little Round Top</a> by the <a>Confederate Army</a> during the <a>Battle of Gettysburg</a>.

</p>
<p>
Four <a>U.S. Navy</a> ships have been named <a>USS <i>Maine</i></a>, most famously the <a>armored cruiser</a><a>USSÂ <i>Maine</i><span>(ACR-1)</span></a> , whose sinking by an explosion on February 15, 1898 precipitated the <a>SpanishâAmerican War</a>.

To the south and east is the Gulf of Maine, and to the west is the state of <a>New Hampshire</a>. The Canadian province of <a>New Brunswick</a> is to the north and northeast, and the province of <a>QuÃ©bec</a> is to the northwest. Maine is the northernmost state in New England and the largest, accounting for almost half of the region's entire land area. Maine is the only state to border exactly one other American state (New Hampshire).

</p>
<p>
Maine is the easternmost state in the United States both in its extreme points and in its geographic center. The town of <a>Lubec</a> is the easternmost organized settlement in the United States. Its Quoddy Head Lighthouse is also the closest place in the United States to Africa and Europe. <a>Estcourt Station</a> is Maine's northernmost point, as well as the northernmost point in New England. (For more information see <a>extreme points of the United States</a>.)

</p>
<p>
Maine's <a>Moosehead Lake</a> is the largest lake wholly in New England, since <a>Lake Champlain</a> is located between <a>Vermont</a>, New York and QuÃ©bec. A number of other Maine lakes, such as <a>South Twin Lake</a>, are described by <a>Thoreau</a> in <i>The Maine Woods</i> (1864). <a>Mount Katahdin</a> is the northern terminus of the <a>Appalachian Trail</a>, which extends southerly to <a>Springer Mountain</a>, <a>Georgia</a>, and the southern terminus of the new <a>International Appalachian Trail</a> which, when complete, will run to <a>Belle Isle</a>, <a>Newfoundland and Labrador</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Machias Seal Island</a> and <a>North Rock</a>, off the state's Downeast coast, are claimed by both Canada and the American town of <a>Cutler</a>, and are within one of <a>four areas between the two countries whose sovereignty is still in dispute</a>, but it is the only one of the disputed areas containing land. Also in this easternmost area in the <a>Bay of Fundy</a> is the <a>Old Sow</a>, the largest <a>tidal</a><a>whirlpool</a>  in the <a>Western Hemisphere</a>.

</p>
<p>
Maine is the least densely populated <a>U.S. state</a> east of the <a>Mississippi River</a>. It is called the <a>Pine Tree State</a>; over 80% of its total land is forested or unclaimed,<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup><a>the most forest cover of any U.S. state</a> . In the wooded areas of the interior lies much uninhabited land, some of which does not have formal political organization into local units (a rarity in New England). The <a>Northwest Aroostook</a><a>unorganized territory</a>  in the northern part of the state, for example, has an area of 2,668 square miles (6,910Â km<sup>2</sup>) and a population of 10, or one person for every 267 square miles (690Â km<sup>2</sup>).

</p>
<p>
Maine is in the <a>temperate broadleaf and mixed forests</a><a>biome</a> . The land near the southern and central Atlantic coast is covered by the mixed <a>oaks</a> of the <a>Northeastern coastal forests</a>. The remainder of the state, including the <a>North Woods</a>, is covered by the <a>New EnglandâAcadian forests</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Maine has almost 230 miles (400Â km) of ocean coastline (and 3,500 miles (5,600Â km) of tidal coastline).<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><a>West Quoddy Head</a>  in Lubec is the easternmost point of land in the 48 contiguous states. Along the famous rock-bound coast of Maine are lighthouses, beaches, fishing villages, and thousands of offshore islands, including the <a>Isles of Shoals</a> which straddle the New Hampshire border. There are jagged rocks and cliffs and many bays and inlets. Inland are lakes, rivers, forests, and mountains. This visual contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been summed up by American poet <a>Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> of <a>Rockland</a> and <a>Camden</a>, in "Renascence":

<p>
Geologists describe this type of landscape as a "drowned coast", where a rising sea level has invaded former land features, creating bays out of valleys and islands out of mountain tops.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> A rise in land elevation due to the melting of heavy glacier ice caused a slight rebounding effect of underlying rock; this land rise, however, was not enough to eliminate all the effect of the rising sea level and its invasion of former land features.

</p>
<p>
Much of Maine's geomorphology was created by extended glacial activity at the end of the <a>last ice age</a>. Prominent glacial features include <a>Somes Sound</a> and Bubble Rock, both part of Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island. Carved by glaciers, Somes Sound is considered to be the only <a>fjord</a> on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of 175 feet (50Â m). The extreme depth and steep drop-off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound. These features also have made it attractive for boat builders, such as the prestigious <a>Hinckley Yachts</a>.

</p>
<p>
Bubble Rock, a <a>glacial erratic</a>, is a large boulder perched on the edge of Bubble Mountain in <a>Acadia National Park</a>. By analyzing the type of granite, geologists discovered that glaciers carried Bubble Rock to its present location from near <a>Lucerne</a>, 30 miles (48Â km) away. The <a>Iapetus Suture</a> runs through the north and west of the state, being underlain by the ancient <a>Laurentian terrane</a>, and the south and east underlain by the <a>Avalonian terrane</a>.

<p>
Maine has a humid continental climate (<a>KÃ¶ppen climate classification</a><i>Dfb</i> ), with warm and sometimes humid summers, and long, cold and very snowy winters. Winters are especially severe in the Northern and Western parts of Maine, while coastal areas are moderated slightly by the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in marginally milder winters and cooler summers than inland regions. Daytime highs are generally in the 75â80Â Â°F (24â27Â Â°C) range throughout the state in July, with overnight lows in the high 50s<span></span>Â°F (around 15<span></span>Â°C). January temperatures range from highs near 30Â Â°F (â1Â Â°C) on the southern coast to overnight lows averaging below 0Â Â°F (â18Â Â°C) in the far north.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state's record high temperature is 105Â Â°F (41Â Â°C), set in July 1911, at North Bridgton.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>
Precipitation in Maine is evenly distributed year-round, but with a slight summer maximum in northern/northwestern Maine and a slight late-fall or early-winter maximum along the coast due to "<a>nor'easters</a>" or intense cold-season rain and snowstorms. In coastal Maine, the late spring and summer months are usually driestâa rarity across the Eastern United States. Maine has fewer days of thunderstorms than any other state east of the <a>Rockies</a>, with most of the state averaging fewer than twenty days of <a>thunderstorms</a> a year. <a>Tornadoes</a> are rare in Maine, with the state averaging fewer than four per year, although this number is increasing. Most severe thunderstorms and tornadoes occur in the Sebago Lakes & Foothills region of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> Maine rarely sees the effect of <a>tropical cyclones</a>, as they tend to pass well east and south or are greatly weakened by the time they reach Maine.

</p>
<p>
In January 2009, a new record low temperature for the state was set at <a>Big Black River</a> of â50Â Â°F (â46Â Â°C), tying the New England record.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Annual precipitation varies from 35.8Â in (909Â mm) in <a>Presque Isle</a> to 56.7Â in (1,441Â mm) in Acadia National Park.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of Maine was 1,344,212 on July 1, 2019, a 1.19% increase since the <a>2010 United States census</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> At the <a>2020 census</a>, 1,362,359 people lived in the state. The state's population density is 41.3 people per square mile, making it the <a>least densely populated state</a> east of the <a>Mississippi River</a>. As of 2010, Maine was also the most rural state in the Union, with only 38.7% of the state's population living within urban areas.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> As explained in detail under "Geography", there are large tracts of uninhabited land in some remote parts of the interior of the state, particularly in the <a>North Maine Woods</a>.

</p>
<p>
The mean population center of Maine is located in <a>Kennebec County</a>, just east of Augusta.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> The <a>Greater Portland metropolitan area</a> is the most densely populated with nearly 40% of Maine's population.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> This area spans three counties and includes many farms and wooded areas; the 2016 population of Portland proper was 66,937.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Maine has experienced a very slow rate of population growth since the 1990 census; its rate of growth (0.57%) since the 2010 census ranks 45th of the 50 states.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> The modest population growth in the state has been concentrated in the southern coastal counties; with more diverse populations slowly moving into these areas of the state. However, the northern, more rural areas of the state have experienced a slight decline in population in recent years.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the <a>2010 Census</a>, Maine has the highest percentage of non-Hispanic <a>whites</a> of any state, at 94.4% of the total population. In 2011, 89.0% of all births in the state were to non-Hispanic white parents.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> Maine also has the second-highest residential senior population.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The table below shows the racial composition of Maine's population as of 2016.

</p>
<p>
According to the 2016 <a>American Community Survey</a>, 1.5% of Maine's population were of <a>Hispanic or Latino</a> origin (of any race): <a>Mexican</a> (0.4%), <a>Puerto Rican</a> (0.4%), <a>Cuban</a> (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (0.6%).<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> The five largest ancestry groups were: <a>English</a> (20.7%), <a>Irish</a> (17.3%), <a>French</a> (15.7%), <a>German</a> (8.1%), and <a>American</a> (7.8%).<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
People citing that they are <a>American</a> are of overwhelmingly English descent, but have ancestry that has been in the region for so long (often since the 17th century) that they choose to identify simply as Americans.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Maine has the highest percentage of <a>French Americans</a> of any state. Most of them are of <a>Canadian</a> origin, but in some cases have been living there since prior to the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>. There are particularly high concentrations in the northern part of Maine in <a>Aroostook County</a>, which is part of a cultural region known as <a>Acadia</a> that goes over the border into <a>New Brunswick</a>. Along with the <a>Acadian</a> population in the north, many French came from <a>Quebec</a> as immigrants between 1840 and 1930.

</p>
<p>
The upper <a>Saint John River</a> valley area was once part of the so-called <a>Republic of Madawaska</a>, before the frontier was decided in the <a>Webster-Ashburton Treaty</a> of 1842. Over a quarter of the population of Lewiston, <a>Waterville</a>, and <a>Biddeford</a> are Franco-American. Most of the residents of the <a>Mid Coast</a> and <a>Down East</a> sections are chiefly of British heritage. Smaller numbers of various other groups, including <a>Irish</a>, <a>Italian</a> and <a>Polish</a>, have settled throughout the state since the late 19th and early 20th century <a>immigration</a> waves.

<ul><li>Since 2016, data for births of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans">White Hispanic</a> origin are not collected, but included in one <i>Hispanic</i> group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.</li></ul>
<h3 id="Language">Language</h3>
<p>
Maine does not have an official language,<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> but the most widely spoken language in the state is English. The 2000 Census reported 92.25% of Maine residents aged five and older spoke only English at home. French-speakers are the state's chief linguistic minority; census figures show that Maine has the highest percentage of people speaking French at home of any state: 5.28% of Maine households are French-speaking, compared with 4.68% in <a>Louisiana</a>, which is the second highest state.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> Although rarely spoken, Spanish is the third-most-common language in Maine, after English and French.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>

Maine's <a>agricultural</a> outputs include poultry, eggs, dairy products, cattle, wild blueberries, apples, <a>maple syrup</a>, and <a>maple sugar</a>. Aroostook County is known for its <a>potato</a> crops. <a>Commercial fishing</a>, once a mainstay of the state's economy, maintains a presence, particularly <a>lobstering</a> and <a>groundfishing</a>. While lobster is the main seafood focus for Maine, the harvest of both oysters and seaweed are on the rise. In 2015, 14% of the Northeast's total oyster supply came from Maine. In 2017, the production of Maine's seaweed industry was estimated at $20Â million per year. The shrimp industry of Maine is on a government-mandated hold. With an ever-decreasing Northern shrimp population, Maine fishermen are no longer allowed to catch and sell shrimp. The hold began in 2014 and is expected to continue until 2021.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> Western Maine aquifers and springs are a major source of bottled water.

</p>
<p>
Maine's industrial outputs consist chiefly of paper, lumber and wood products, electronic equipment, leather products, food products, textiles, and bio-technology. Naval shipbuilding and construction remain key as well, with <a>Bath Iron Works</a> in Bath and <a>Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</a> in Kittery.

</p>
<p>
Brunswick Landing, formerly <a>Naval Air Station Brunswick</a>, is also in Maine. Formerly a large support base for the U.S. Navy, the <a>BRAC</a> campaign initiated the Naval Air Station's closing, despite a government-funded effort to upgrade its facilities. The former base has since been changed into a civilian business park, as well as a new satellite campus for <a>Southern Maine Community College</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>

<p>
Maine is the number one U.S. producer of low-bush <a>blueberries</a> (<a>Vaccinium angustifolium</a>). Preliminary data from the <a>USDA</a> for 2012 also indicate Maine was the largest blueberry producer of the major blueberry producing states, with 91,100,000 lbs.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> This data includes both low (wild), and high-bush (cultivated) blueberries: <a>Vaccinium corymbosum</a>. The largest toothpick manufacturing plant in the United States used to be located in <a>Strong, Maine</a>. The Strong Wood Products plant produced 20Â million toothpicks a day. It closed in May 2003.

<p>
Tourism and outdoor recreation play a major and increasingly important role in Maine's economy. The state is a popular destination for sport <a>hunting</a> (particularly deer, moose and bear), <a>sport fishing</a>, <a>snowmobiling</a>, <a>skiing</a>, boating, <a>camping</a> and <a>hiking</a>, among other activities. Concomitantly with the tourist and recreation-oriented economy, Maine has developed a burgeoning <a>creative economy</a>, most notably centered in the <a>Greater Portland</a> vicinity.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Historically, Maine ports played a key role in national transportation. Beginning around 1880, Portland's rail link and <a>ice-free port</a> made it Canada's principal winter port, until the aggressive development of <a>Halifax</a>, Nova Scotia, in the mid-20th century. In 2013, 12,039,600 <a>short tons</a> passed into and out of Portland by sea,<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup> which places it 45th of U.S. water ports.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup><a>Portland International Jetport</a>  has been expanded, providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as <a>JetBlue</a> and <a>Southwest Airlines</a>.

</p>
<p>
Maine has very few large companies that maintain headquarters in the state, and that number has fallen due to consolidations and mergers, particularly in the <a>pulp and paper industry</a>. Some of the larger companies that do maintain headquarters in Maine include <a>Covetrus</a> in Portland, <a>Fairchild Semiconductor</a> in South Portland, <a>IDEXX Laboratories</a> in Westbrook, <a>Hannaford Bros. Co.</a> in Scarborough; <a>TD Bank</a> in Portland and <a>L.L.Bean</a> in Freeport. Maine is also the home of the <a>Jackson Laboratory</a>, the world's largest non-profit mammalian genetic research facility and the world's largest supplier of genetically purebred mice.

<p>
Maine has an <a>income tax</a> structure containing two brackets, 6.5 and 7.95 percent of personal income.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> Before July 2013 Maine had four brackets: 2, 4.5, 7, and 8.5 percent.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup> Maine's general <a>sales tax</a> rate is 5.5 percent. The state also levies charges of nine percent on lodging and prepared food and ten percent on short-term auto rentals.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> Commercial sellers of blueberries, a Maine staple, must keep records of their transactions and pay the state 1.5 cents per pound ($1.50 per 100 pounds) of the fruit sold each season. All <a>real</a> and tangible <a>personal property</a> located in the state of Maine is taxable unless specifically exempted by statute. The administration of property taxes is handled by the local assessor in incorporated cities and towns, while property taxes in the unorganized territories are handled by the State Tax Assessor.

<p>
Maine has a long-standing tradition of being home to many shipbuilding companies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Maine was home to many shipyards that produced wooden sailing ships. The main function of these ships was to transport either cargos or passengers overseas. One of these yards was located in <a>Pennellville Historic District</a> in what is now Brunswick, Maine. This yard, owned by the Pennell family, was typical of the many family-owned shipbuilding companies of the time period. Other such examples of shipbuilding families were the Skolfields and the Morses. During the 18th and 19th centuries, wooden shipbuilding of this sort made up a sizable portion of the economy.

Maine receives <a>passenger jet</a> service at its two largest airports, the <a>Portland International Jetport</a> in Portland, and the <a>Bangor International Airport</a> in Bangor. Both are served daily by many major <a>airlines</a> to destinations such as New York, <a>Atlanta</a>, and <a>Orlando</a>. <a>Essential Air Service</a> also subsidizes service to a number of smaller airports in Maine, bringing small <a>turboprop</a> aircraft to regional airports such as the <a>Augusta State Airport</a>, <a>Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport</a>, <a>Knox County Regional Airport</a>, and the <a>Northern Maine Regional Airport at Presque Isle</a>. These airports are served by regional providers such as <a>Cape Air</a> with Cessna 402s, and <a>CommutAir</a> with Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.

</p>
<p>
Many smaller airports are scattered throughout Maine, serving only <a>general aviation</a> traffic. The <a>Eastport Municipal Airport</a>, for example, is a city-owned public-use airport with 1,200 general aviation aircraft operations each year from single-engine and ultralight aircraft.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup>

The <a>Maine Constitution</a> structures Maine's state government, composed of three co-equal branchesâthe executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The state of Maine also has three Constitutional Officers (the Secretary of State, the State Treasurer, and the State Attorney General) and one Statutory Officer (the State Auditor).

</p>
<p>
The <a>legislative branch</a> is the <a>Maine Legislature</a>, a bicameral body composed of the <a>Maine House of Representatives</a>, with 151 members, and the <a>Maine Senate</a>, with 35 members. The Legislature is charged with introducing and passing laws.

</p>
<p>
The <a>executive branch</a> is responsible for the execution of the laws created by the Legislature and is headed by the <a>Governor of Maine</a> (currently <a>Janet Mills</a>). The Governor is elected every four years; no individual may serve more than two consecutive terms in this office. The current <a>attorney general of Maine</a> is <a>Aaron Frey</a>. As with other <a>state legislatures</a>, the Maine Legislature can by a two-thirds majority vote from both the House and Senate override a gubernatorial veto. Maine is one of seven states that do not have a lieutenant governor.

</p>
<p>
The <a>judicial branch</a> is responsible for interpreting state laws. The highest court of the state is the <a>Maine Supreme Judicial Court</a>. The lower courts are the District Court, <a>Superior Court</a> and Probate Court. All judges except for probate judges serve full-time, are nominated by the Governor and confirmed by the Legislature for terms of seven years. Probate judges serve part-time and are elected by the voters of each county for four-year terms.

In state <a>general elections</a>, Maine voters tend to accept <a>independent</a> and third-party candidates more frequently than most states. Maine has had two independent governors recently (<a>James B. Longley</a>, 1975â1979 and current U.S. Senator <a>Angus King</a>, 1995â2003). Maine state politicians, Democrats and Republicans alike, are noted for having more moderate views than many in the national wings of their respective parties.

In the 1930s, Maine was one of very few states which retained <a>Republican</a> sentiments. In the <a>1936 presidential election</a>, <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> received the <a>electoral votes</a> of every state other than Maine and <a>Vermont</a>; these were the only two states in the nation that never voted for Roosevelt in any of his presidential campaigns, though Maine was closely fought in <a>1940</a> and <a>1944</a>. In the 1960s, Maine began to lean toward the <a>Democrats</a>, especially in <a>presidential</a> elections. In <a>1968</a>, <a>Hubert Humphrey</a> became just the second Democrat in half a century to carry Maine, perhaps because of the presence of his running mate, Maine Senator <a>Edmund Muskie</a>, although the state voted Republican in every presidential election in the 1970s and 1980s.

<p>
Since 1969, two of Maine's four electoral votes have been awarded based on the winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except <a>Nebraska</a> gives all its electoral votes to the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. Maine split its electoral vote for the first time in 2016, with Donald Trump's strong showing in the more rural central and northern Maine allowing him to capture one of the state's four votes in the Electoral College.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup>

<p>
<a>Ross Perot</a> achieved a great deal of success in Maine in the presidential elections of <a>1992</a> and <a>1996</a>. In 1992, as an <a>independent candidate</a>, Perot came in second to Democrat <a>Bill Clinton</a>, despite the long-time presence of the <a>Bush family</a> summer home in <a>Kennebunkport</a>. In 1996, as the nominee of the <a>Reform Party</a>, Perot did better in Maine than in any other state.

</p>
<p>
Maine has voted for Democratic Bill Clinton twice, <a>Al Gore</a> in <a>2000</a>, <a>John Kerry</a> in <a>2004</a>, and <a>Barack Obama</a> in <a>2008</a> and <a>2012</a>. In <a>2016</a>, Republican <a>Donald Trump</a> won one of Maine's electoral votes with Democratic opponent <a>Hillary Clinton</a> winning the other three. Although Democrats have mostly carried the state in presidential elections in recent years, Republicans have largely maintained their control of the state's <a>U.S. Senate</a> seats, with Edmund Muskie, <a>William Hathaway</a> and <a>George J. Mitchell</a> being the only Maine Democrats serving in the U.S. Senate in the past fifty years.

</p>
<p>
In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made major gains in Maine. They captured the governor's office as well as majorities in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since the early 1970s. However, in the 2012 elections Democrats managed to recapture both houses of <a>Maine Legislature</a>.

</p>
<p>
Maine's U.S. senators are Republican <a>Susan Collins</a> and <a>Independent</a> Angus King. The governor is Democrat <a>Janet Mills</a>. The state's two members of the <a>United States House of Representatives</a> are Democrats <a>Chellie Pingree</a> and

An organized municipality has a form of elected local government which administers and provides local services, keeps records, collects licensing fees, and can pass locally binding <a>ordinances</a>, among other responsibilities of self-government. The governmental format of most organized towns and <a>plantations</a> is the town meeting, while the format of most cities is the council-manager form. As of 2013<sup><a>[update]</a></sup> the organized municipalities of Maine consist of 23 <a>cities</a>, 431 <a>towns</a>, and 34 <a>plantations</a>. Collectively these 488 organized municipalities cover less than half of the state's territory. Maine also has three<sup>[<i><a><span>contradictory</span></a></i>]</sup> Reservations: <a>Indian Island</a>, Indian Township Reservation, and Pleasant Point Indian Reservation.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup>

<p>
<a>Unorganized territory</a> (UT) has no local government. Administration, services, licensing, and ordinances are handled by the state government as well as by respective county governments who have townships within each county's bounds. The unorganized territory of Maine consists of more than 400 townships (towns are incorporated, townships are unincorporated), plus many coastal islands that do not lie within any municipal bounds. The UT land area is slightly over half the entire area of the State of Maine. Year-round residents in the UT number approximately 9,000 (about 1.3% of the state's total population), with many more people staying there only seasonally. Only four of <a>Maine's sixteen counties</a> (Androscoggin, Cumberland, Waldo and York) are entirely incorporated, although a few others are nearly so, and most of the unincorporated area is in the vast and sparsely populated <a>Great North Woods of Maine</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup>

<p>
Maine was a center of agriculture before it achieved statehood. Prior to colonization, <a>Wabanaki</a> nations farmed large crops of corn and other produce in southern Maine.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup> The state is a major producer of potatoes, wild blueberries, apples, maple syrup and sweet corn. Dairy products and chicken's eggs are other major industries.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>

<p>
Maine has many vegetable farms and other small, diversified farms. In the 1960s and 1970s, the book "Living the Good Life" by <a>Helen Nearing</a> and <a>Scott Nearing</a> caused many young people to move to Maine and engage in small-scale farming and homesteading. These <a>back-to-the-land</a> migrants increased the population of some counties.<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup>

A citizen of Maine is known as a "Mainer",<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup> though the term is often reserved for those whose roots in Maine go back at least three generations.<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup> The term "Downeaster" may be applied to residents of the northeast coast of the state. The term "Mainiac" is considered by some to be derogatory, but is embraced with pride by others,<sup><a href="#ref_129">[129]</a></sup> and is used for a variety of organizations and for events such as the YMCA Mainiac Sprint Triathlon & Duathlon.<sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup>
