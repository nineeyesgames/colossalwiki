<p>
Killarney featured prominently in early Irish history, with religious settlements playing an important part of its recorded history.  Its first significantly historical settlement was the monastery on nearby <a>Innisfallen Island</a> founded in 640 by <a>St. Finian the Leper</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> which was occupied for approximately 850 years.

</p>
<p>
Innisfallen (from Irish: <i>Inis Faithlinn</i>, meaning "Faithlinn's island") is an island in Lough Leane, one of the three Lakes of Killarney. It is home to the ruins of Innisfallen Abbey which was founded in 640 by St. Finian, and was occupied until the monks were dispossessed in 1594, by <a>Elizabeth I, Queen of England</a>. According to tradition, the <a>Irish High King</a><a>Brian Boru</a>  received his education at Innisfallen. 

</p>
<p>
<a>Aghadoe</a>, the local townland which overlooks present day Killarney, may have begun as a pagan religious site.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>  The site has also been associated with the 5th century missionary <a>St. Abban</a>, but 7th century <a>ogham</a> stones mark the first clear evidence of Aghadoe being used as an important site.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>  According to legend, St. Finian founded a monastery at Aghadoe in the 6th or 7th century.  The first written record of a <a>monastery</a> dates from 939 AD in the <a>Annals of Innisfallen</a> where the Aghadoe monastery is referred to as the "Old Abbey."<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, the Normans built <a>Parkavonear Castle</a>, also at Aghadoe.  The castle was perhaps intended as an early warning outpost due to its views of the entire Killarney valley and lakes region.

</p>
<p>
<a>Ross Castle</a> was built on the lake shore in the late 15th century by local ruling clan the O'Donoghues Mor (Ross). Ownership of the castle changed hands during the <a>Desmond Rebellions</a> of the 1580s to the Mac Carty Mor.

</p>
<p>
<a>Muckross Abbey</a> was founded in 1448 as a <a>Franciscan</a><a>friary</a>  for the Observantine Franciscans by Donal McCarthy Mor.  The abbey was burned down by <a>Cromwellian</a> forces under <a>General Ludlow</a> in 1654, and today remains a ruin.

</p>
<p>
Killarney was heavily involved in the <a>Irish War of Independence</a>.  The town, and indeed the entire county, had strong republican ties, and skirmishes with the British forces happened on a regular basis.
The Great Southern Hotel was for a while taken over by the British,<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> both as an office and barracks, and to protect the neighbouring railway station. One notable event during the war was the <a>Headford Ambush</a> when the <a>IRA</a> attacked a railway train a few kilometres from town.

</p>
<p>
However, divisions among former colleagues were quick to develop following the truce and treaty, and Killarney, like many other areas, suffered in the rash of increasing <a>atrocities</a> during the <a>Civil War</a>.  A day after the <a>Ballyseedy Massacre</a>, five <a>Republican</a> prisoners were murdered in Killarney by Free State forces.

<p>
Killarney's tourism history goes back at least to the mid 18th century, when <a>Thomas, fourth Viscount Kenmare</a> (Lord Kenmare), began to attract visitors and new residents to the town.  The date of 1747 was used in recent 250-year celebrations to honour the history of Killarney tourism.  A visit by <a>Queen Victoria</a> in 1861 gave the town some international exposure.

</p>
<p>

Killarney benefited greatly from the coming of the railway in July 1853. British trade directory publisher <a>Isaac Slater</a> noted that there were three hotels in the town in 1846<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> but by 1854, one year after the coming of the railway, James Fraser named seven hotels and described their locations:
</p>
<p>
In 1858, Irish born Victorian journalist, <a>Samuel Carter Hall</a> named O'Sullivan's Hotel and the Innisfallen rather than the Hibernia and Torc, but Isaac Slater also named the Hibernia in 1846. At the time he was writing, tours of the <a>Ring of Kerry</a> were already an industry and Killarney was considered the starting point of the 175-kilometre (110 mi) circuitous route. He was fascinated by the horses' endurance on the two-day trip, and leaves clear advice for other travellers; 

</p>
<p>
As part of the trip, he noted that there were hotels in <a>Glenbeigh</a> and  <a>Waterville</a> along with a "comfortable inn", which is now <a>The Butler Arms Hotel</a>.

</p>

<p>
<a>Thomas Browne, 4th Viscount Kenmare</a> founded linen mills in the 1740s as part of his efforts to increase the population and economy of Killarney. In later years, <a>hosiery</a> and shoe making were major industries in the town.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Modern employers include <a>Liebherr Cranes</a>, which has had a presence in Killarney since 1958, with a combined manufacturing/research and development facility in the town manufacturing container cranes.
