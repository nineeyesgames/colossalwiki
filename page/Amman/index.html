</p>
<p>
The earliest evidence of settlement in Amman comes from a Neolithic site known as <a>'Ain Ghazal</a>, which reached its height around 7000 BC. During the <a>Iron Age</a>, the city was known as Rabbath Ammon and served as the capital of the <a>Ammonite</a> civilization. In the 3rd century BC, <a>Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, <a>Pharaoh</a> of <a>Ptolemaic Egypt</a>, rebuilt the city and renamed it "Philadelphia", making it a regional center of <a>Hellenistic</a> culture. Under <a>Roman</a> rule, Philadelphia was one of the ten Greek cities of the <a>Decapolis</a> before being directly ruled as part of <a>Arabia Petraea</a>. The <a>Rashidun Caliphate</a> conquered the city from the <a>Byzantines</a> in the 7th century AD, and gave it its current name of Amman. Throughout most of the <a>Middle Ages</a>, the city alternated between periods of devastation and abandonment and periods of relative prosperity as the center of the <a>Balqa</a> region. Amman was largely abandoned from the 15th century until 1878, when <a>Ottoman</a> authorities began settling <a>Circassian</a> refugees there. 

</p>
<p>
Amman's first municipal council was established in 1909.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> Amman witnessed rapid growth after its designation as <a>Transjordan</a>'s capital in 1921, and after several successive waves of refugees: Palestinians in 1948 and 1967; Iraqis in 1990 and 2003; and Syrians since 2011. It was initially built on <a>seven hills</a> but now spans over 19 hills combining 22 areas,<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> which are administered by the <a>Greater Amman Municipality</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> Areas of Amman have gained their names from either the hills (Jabal) or the valleys (Wadi) they occupy, such as Jabal Lweibdeh and Wadi Abdoun.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> East Amman is predominantly filled with historic sites that frequently host cultural activities, while West Amman is more modern and serves as the economic center of the city.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Approximately two million visitors arrived in Amman in 2014, which made it the 93rd most-visited city in the world and the fifth most-visited Arab city.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Amman has a relatively fast growing economy,<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> and it is ranked as a Beta− <a>global city</a> by the <a>Globalization and World Cities Research Network</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> The city is among the most popular locations in the <a>Arab world</a> for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside <a>Doha</a> and only behind <a>Dubai</a>.

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
Amman derives its name from the ancient people of the <a>Ammonites</a>, whose capital the city has been since the 13th century BCE. The Ammonites named it 𐤓𐤁𐤕 𐤏𐤌𐤍, <i>Rabbat ʻAmmān</i>,<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> with the term <i>Rabbat</i> meaning the "Capital" or the "King's Quarters". In the <a>Hebrew Bible</a>, Rabbat ʻAmmān is referred to as "Rabbat Bnei ʿAmmon" (<a>Biblical Hebrew</a>: <span>רבת בני עמון</span>‎, <a>Tiberian Hebrew</a><i>Rabbaṯ Bəne ʿAmmôn</i> ), shortened in <a>Modern Hebrew</a> to "Rabbat Ammon" , and appears in English translations as "Rabbath Ammon". Over time, the term "Rabbat" was no longer used and the influence of new civilizations that conquered the city gradually changed its name to "Amman".<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, <a>Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, the Macedonian ruler of the <a>Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> who reigned from 283 to 246 BC, renamed the city to "Philadelphia" (<a>Ancient Greek</a>: <span>Φιλαδέλφεια</span>; literally: "<a>brotherly love</a>") after occupying it. The name was given as an adulation to his own nickname, Philadelphus.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Neolithic</a> site of <a>'Ain Ghazal</a> was found in the outskirts of Amman. At its height, around 7000 BC, it had an area of 15 hectares (37 acres) and was inhabited by ca. 3000 people (four to five times the population of contemporary Jericho). At that time the site was a typical <a>aceramic</a><a>Neolithic</a>  village. Its houses were rectangular mud-bricked buildings that included a main square living room, whose walls were made up of lime plaster.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The site was discovered in 1974 as construction workers were working on a road crossing the area. By 1982, when the excavations started, around 600 meters (2,000 feet) of road ran through the site. Despite the damage brought by urban expansion, the remains of 'Ain Ghazal provided a wealth of information.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>

'Ain Ghazal is well known for a set of small human statues found in 1983, when local archeologists stumbled upon the edge of a large pit 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) containing them.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> These statues are human figures made with white plaster, with painted clothes, hair, and in some cases ornamental tattoos. Thirty-two figures were found in two caches, fifteen of them full figures, fifteen busts, and two fragmentary heads. Three of the busts were two-headed, the significance of which is not clear.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>

<p>
In the 13th century BC Amman was the capital of the <a>Ammonites</a>, and became known as"Rabbah" or "Rabbath Ammon". Ammon provided several natural resources to the region, including sandstone and limestone, along with a productive agricultural sector that made Ammon a vital location along the <a>King's Highway</a>, the ancient trade route connecting <a>Egypt</a> with <a>Mesopotamia</a>, <a>Syria</a> and <a>Anatolia</a>. As with the <a>Edomites</a> and <a>Moabites</a>, trade along this route gave the Ammonites considerable revenue.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> Ammonites worshiped an ancient <a>deity</a> called <a>Moloch</a>. Excavations by archeologists near <a>Amman Civil Airport</a> uncovered a temple, which included an altar containing many human bone fragments. The bones showed evidence of burning, which led to the assumption that the altar functioned as a <a>pyre</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Today, several Ammonite ruins across Amman exist, such as <a>Rujm Al-Malfouf</a> and some parts of the <a>Amman Citadel</a>. The ruins of Rujm Al-Malfouf consist of a stone watchtower used to ensure protection of their capital and several store rooms to the east.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>

Conquest of the <a>Middle East</a> and <a>Central Asia</a> by <a>Alexander the Great</a> firmly consolidated the influence of <a>Hellenistic culture</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The Greeks founded new cities in the area of modern-day Jordan, including <a>Umm Qays</a>, <a>Jerash</a> and Amman. <a>Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, the Macedonian ruler of Egypt, who occupied and rebuilt the city, named it "Philadelphia" (<a>Ancient Greek</a>: <span>Φιλαδέλφεια</span>), evoking "brotherly love" in <a>Greek</a>.

<p>
<sup>[<i><a><span>dubious</span></a><span> – <a>discuss</a></span></i>]</sup>

<p>
One of the most original monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of <a>Iraq al-Amir</a> in the valley of <a>Wadi as-Sir</a>, southwest of Amman, which is home to <a>Qasr al-Abd</a> ('Castle of the Slave'). Other nearby ruins include a village, an isolated house and a fountain, all of which are barely visible today due to the damage brought by a major earthquake that hit the region in the year 362.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> Qasr al-Abd is believed to have been built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful <a>Tobiad</a> family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in c. 170-168 BC, upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered <a>Jerusalem</a>, ransacked the <a>Temple</a> where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept, and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide,<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>dubious</span></a><span> – <a>discuss</a></span></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The Tobiads fought the Arab <a>Nabateans</a> for twenty years until they lost the city to them. After losing Philadelphia, we no longer hear of the Tobiad family in written sources.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Romans</a> conquered much of the <a>Levant</a> in 63 BC, inaugurating a period of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries. In the northern modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), <a>Gerasa</a>, <a>Gedara</a>, <a>Pella</a> and <a>Arbila</a> joined with other cities in <a>Palestine</a> and <a>Syria</a>; <a>Scythopolis</a>, <a>Hippos</a>, <a>Capitolias</a>, <a>Canatha</a> and <a>Damascus</a> to form the <a>Decapolis League</a>, a fabled confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from <a>Ailah</a> to Damascus that was built by Emperor <a>Trajan</a> in 106 AD. This provided an economic boost for the city in a short period of time.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Roman rule in Jordan left several ruins across the country, some of which exist in Amman, such as the <a>Temple of Hercules</a> at the <a>Amman Citadel</a>, the <a>Roman Theatre</a>, the <a>Odeon</a>, and the <a>Nymphaeum</a>. The two theaters and the <a>nymphaeum</a> fountain were built during the reign of Emperor <a>Antoninus Pius</a> around AD 161. The theatre was the larger venue of the two and had a capacity for 6,000 attendees. It was oriented north and built into the hillside, to protect the audience from the sun. To the northeast of the theatre was a small <a>odeon</a>. Built at roughly the same time as the theatre, the Odeon had 500 seats and is still in use today for music concerts. Archaeologists speculate that the structure was originally covered with a wooden roof to shield the audience from the weather. The Nymphaeum is situated southwest of the Odeon and served as Philadelphia's chief fountain. The Nymphaeum is believed to have contained a 600 square meters (6,500 sq ft) pool which was 3 meters (9.8 ft) deep and was continuously refilled with water.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the late <a>Byzantine</a> period in the seventh century, several bishops and churches were based in the city.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>

<p>
In the 630s, the <a>Rashidun Caliphate</a> conquered the region from the <a>Byzantines</a>, beginning the Islamic era in the Levant. Philadelphia was renamed "Amman" by the Muslims and became part of the district of <a>Jund al-Urdunn</a>. A large part of the population already spoke <a>Arabic</a>, which facilitated integration into the <a>caliphate</a>, as well as several conversions to <a>Islam</a>. Under the <a>Umayyad</a> caliphs who began their rule in 661 AD, numerous <a>desert castles</a> were established as a means to govern the desert area of modern-day Jordan, several of which are still well-preserved. Amman had already been functioning as an administrative centre. The Umayyads built a large palace on the <a>Amman Citadel</a> hill, known today as the <a>Umayyad Palace</a>. Amman was later destroyed by several earthquakes and natural disasters, including a particularly severe earthquake in 747. The Umayyads were <a>overthrown</a> by the <a>Abbasids</a> three years later.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Amman's importance declined by the mid-8th century after damage caused by several earthquakes rendered it uninhabitable.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> Excavations among the collapsed layer of the Umayyad Palace have revealed remains of <a>kilns</a> from the time of the Abbasids (750–969) and the <a>Fatimids</a> (969–1099).<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> In the late 9th century, Amman was noted as the "capital" of the <a>Balqa</a> by geographer <a>al-Yaqubi</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Likewise, in 985, the <a>Jerusalemite</a> historian <a>al-Muqaddasi</a> described Amman as the capital of Balqa,<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> and that it was a town in the desert fringe of Syria surrounded by villages and cornfields and was a regional source of lambs, grain and honey.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> Furthermore, al-Muqaddasi describes Amman as a "harbor of the desert" where Arab Bedouin would take refuge, and that its citadel, which overlooked the town, contained a small mosque.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Crusader%2FAyyubid_period">Crusader/Ayyubid period</h3>
<p>
The occupation of the Citadel Hill by the <a>Crusader</a><a>Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>  is so far based only on interpretations of Crusader sources. <a>William of Tyre</a> writes in his <i>Historia</i> that in 1161 <a>Philip of Milly</a> received the castle of "Ahamant", which is seen to refer to Amman, as part of the lordship of <a>Oultrejordain</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> In 1166 Philip joined the <a>military order</a> of the <a>Knights Templar</a>, passing on to them a significant part of his <a>fief</a> including the castle of Ahamant<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> or "Haman", as it is named in the deed of confirmation issued by King <a>Amalric</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> By 1170, Amman was in <a>Ayyubid</a> hands.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> The remains of a watch tower on Citadel Hill, first attributed to the Crusaders, now are preferentially dated to the <a>Ayyubid</a> period, leaving it to further research to find the location of the Crusader castle.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> During the Ayyubid period, the Damascene geographer <a>al-Dimashqi</a> wrote that Amman was part of the province of <a>al-Karak</a>, although "only ruins" remained of the town.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Mamluk_and%20pre-1878%20Ottoman%20Amman">Mamluk and pre-1878 Ottoman Amman</h3>
<p>
During the <a>Mamluk</a> era (late 13th–early 16th centuries), the region of Amman was a part of Wilayat Balqa, the southernmost district of Mamlakat Dimashq (Damascus Province).<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> The capital of the district in the first half of the 14th century was the minor administrative post of <a>Hisban</a>, which had a considerably smaller garrison than the other administrative centers in Transjordan, namely <a>Ajlun</a> and al-Karak.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> In 1321, the geographer <a>Abu'l Fida</a>, recorded that Amman was "a very ancient town" with fertile soil and surrounded by agricultural fields.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> For unclear, though likely financial reasons, in 1356, the capital of Balqa was transferred from Hisban to Amman, which was considered a <i>madina</i> (city).<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> In 1357, Emir <a>Sirghitmish</a> bought Amman in its entirety, most likely to use revenues from the city to help fund the <a>Madrasa of Sirghitmish</a>, which he built in <a>Cairo</a> that same year.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> After his purchase of the city, Sirghitmish transferred the courts, administrative bureaucracy, markets and most of the inhabitants of Hisban to Amman.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> Moreover, he financed new building works in the city.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Ownership of Amman following Sirghitmish's death in 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants sold it to Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the <i>na'ib as-saltana</i> (viceroy) of Damascus.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the <i>na'ib as-saltana</i> of Egypt.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> The increasingly frequent division and sale of the city and lands of Amman to different owners signalled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used to shelter seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> The <a>Ottoman Empire</a> annexed the region of Amman in 1516, but for much of the Ottoman period, <a>al-Salt</a> functioned as the virtual political center of Transjordan.

Amman began to be resettled in 1878, when several hundred Muslim <a>Circassian</a> refugees arrived following their expulsion from the formerly Ottoman Balkans.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> Between 1878 and 1910, tens of thousands of Circassians had relocated to <a>Ottoman Syria</a> after being displaced by the <a>Russian Empire</a> during the events of the <a>Russo-Circassian War</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> The Ottoman authorities directed the <a>Circassian immigrants</a>, who were mainly of peasant stock, to settle in Amman, and distributed arable land among them.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> Their settlement was a partial manifestation of the Ottoman statesman <a>Kamil Pasha</a>'s project to establish a <a>vilayet</a> centered in Amman, which, along with other sites in its vicinity, would become Circassian-populated townships guaranteeing the security of the Damascus–<a>Medina</a> highway.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> The first Circassian settlers, who belonged to the <a>Shapsug</a> dialect group,<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> lived near Amman's Roman theater and incorporated its stones into the houses they built.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> The English traveller <a>Laurence Oliphant</a> noted in his 1879 visit that most of the original Circassian settlers had left Amman by then, with about 150 remaining.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> They were joined by Circassians from the <a>Kabardian</a> and <a>Abzakh</a> groups in 1880–1892.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>

Until 1900 settlement was concentrated in the valley and slopes of the Amman stream and settlers built mud-brick houses with wooden roofs.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> The French Dominican priest <a>Marie-Joseph Lagrange</a> commented in 1890 about Amman: "A mosque, the ancient bridges, all that jumbled with the houses of the Circassians gives Amman a remarkable physiognomy".<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> The new village became a <i><a>nahiye</a></i> (subdistrict) center of the <i><a>kaza</a></i> of al-Salt in the <a>Karak Sanjak</a> established in 1894.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> By 1908 Amman contained 800 houses divided between three main quarters, Shapsug, Kabartai and Abzakh, each called after the Circassian groupings which respectively settled there, a number of mosques, open-air markets, shops, bakeries, mills, a textile factory, a post and telegraph office and a government compound (<a>saraya</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> Kurdish settlers formed their own quarter called "al-Akrad" after them, while a number of townspeople from nearby al-Salt and <a>al-Fuheis</a>, seeking to avoid high taxes and conscription or attracted by financial incentives, and traders from <a>Najd</a> and <a>Morocco</a>, had also moved to the town.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision to construct the <a>Hejaz Railway</a>, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual <a>Hajj</a> pilgrimage and trade. Operational in central Transjordan since 1903, the <a>Hejaz Railway</a> helped to transform Amman from a small village into a major commercial hub in the region. Circassian entrepreneurship, facilitated by the railway, helped to attract investment from merchants from Damascus, Nablus, and Jerusalem, many of whom moved to Amman in the 1900s and 1910s.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Amman's first municipal council was established in 1909, and Circassian <a>Ismael Babouk</a> was elected as its mayor.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>First</a> and <a>Second Battle of Amman</a> were part of the <a>Middle Eastern theatre</a> of <a>World War I</a> and the <a>Arab Revolt</a>, taking place in 1918. Amman had a strategic location along the Hejaz Railway; its capture by British forces and the <a>Hashemite Arab army</a> facilitated the British advance towards <a>Damascus</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> The second battle was won by the British, resulting in the establishment of the <a>British Mandate</a>.

<p>
In 1921, the Hashemite emir and later king <a>Abdullah I</a> designated Amman instead of al-Salt to be the capital of the newly created state, the <a>Emirate of Transjordan</a>, which became the <a>Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan</a> in 1950. Its function as the capital of the country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest urban settlement east of the <a>Jordan River</a> at the time. The early settlers who came from <a>Palestine</a> were overwhelmingly from <a>Nablus</a>, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from the southern part of the country, particularly al-Karak and <a>Madaba</a>. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The British report from 1933 shows around 1,700 Circassians living in Amman.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> Yet the community was far from insulated. Local urban and nomadic communities formed alliances with the Circassians, some of which are still present today. This cemented the status of Circassians in the re-established city.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Jordan gained its independence in 1946 and Amman was designated the country's capital. Amman received many refugees during wartime events in nearby countries, beginning with the <a>1948 Arab–Israeli War</a>. A second wave arrived after the <a>Six-Day War</a> in 1967. In 1970, Amman was a battlefield during the conflict between the <a>Palestine Liberation Organization</a> (PLO) and the <a>Jordanian Army</a> known as <a>Black September</a>. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to <a>Lebanon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The first wave of Iraqi and Kuwaiti refugees settled in the city after the 1991 <a>Gulf War</a>, with a second wave occurring in the aftermath of the <a>2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.

On 9 November 2005, <a>Al-Qaeda</a> under <a>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>'s leadership launched <a>coordinated explosions</a> in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> Most recently a wave of <a>Syrian refugees</a> have arrived in the city during the ongoing <a>Syrian Civil War</a> which began in 2011. Amman was a principal destination for refugees for the security and prosperity it offered.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

<p>
During the last ten years,<sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup> the city has experienced an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Amman is the site of major mega projects such as the <a>Abdali Urban Regeneration Project</a> and the <a>Jordan Gate Towers</a>. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including the <a>Four Seasons Hotel Amman</a>, <a>Sheraton Hotel Amman</a>, <a>Fairmont Amman</a>, <a>St. Regis Hotel Amman</a>, <a>Le Royal Hotel</a> and others.

<p>
Amman is situated on the <a>East Bank Plateau</a>, an upland characterized by three major <a>wadis</a> which run through it.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> Originally, the city had been <a>built on seven hills</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> Amman's terrain is typified by its mountains.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> The most important areas in the city are named after the hills or mountains they lie on.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> The area's elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,100 m (3,300 to 3,600 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup><a>Al-Salt</a>  and <a>al-Zarqa</a> are located to the northwest and northeast, respectively, <a>Madaba</a> is located to the west, and <a>al-Karak</a> and <a>Ma'an</a> are to Amman's southwest and southeast, respectively. One of the only remaining springs in Amman now supplies the <a>Zarqa River</a> with water.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Trees found in Amman include <a>Aleppo pine</a>, <a>Mediterranean cypress</a> and <a>Phoenician juniper</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>

<p>
Amman's position on the mountains near the <a>Mediterranean climate</a> zone places it under the <a>semi-arid climate</a> classification (<a>Köppen climate</a>: BSh borders on BSk). Summers are moderately long, mildly hot and breezy; however, one or two heat waves may occur during summer. Spring is brief and warm, where highs reach 28 °C (82 °F). Spring usually starts between April and May, and lasts about a month. Winter usually starts around the end of November and continues from early to mid-March. Temperatures are usually near or below 17 °C (63 °F), with snow occasionally falling once or twice a year. Rain averages about 300 mm (12 in) a year and periodic droughts are common, where most rain falls between November and April.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> At least 120 days of heavy fog per year is usual.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Difference in elevation plays a major role in the different weather conditions experienced in the city: snow may accumulate in the western and northern parts of Amman (an average altitude of 1,000 m (3,300 ft) above sea level) while at the same time it could be raining at the city center (elevation of 700 m (2,300 ft).<sup>[<i><a><span>clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Amman has extreme examples of <a>microclimate</a>, and almost every district exhibits its own weather.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> It is known among locals that some boroughs such as the northern suburb of Abu Nser are among the coldest in the city and can experience frost, while other districts such as Marka experience much warmer temperatures.

</p>
<p>
The temperatures listed below are taken from the weather station at the center of the city which is at an elevation of 700 meters (2,300 ft) <a>above sea level</a>. At higher elevations, the temperatures are usually lower during winter and higher during summer. For example, in areas such as al-Jubaiha, Sweileh, Khalda, and Abu Nser, Tabarbour, Basman which are at/higher than 700 m (2,300 ft) above sea level have average temperatures of 7 to 9 °C (45 to 48 °F) in the day and 1 to 3 °C (34 to 37 °F) at night in January. In August, the average high temperatures in these areas are 25 to 28 °C (77 to 82 °F) in the day and 14 to 16 °C (57 to 61 °F) at night.<sup>[<i><a><span>original research?</span></a></i>]</sup>

Amman is governed by a 41-member city council elected in four-year term direct elections. All Jordanian citizens above 18 years old are eligible to vote in the municipal elections. However, the mayor is appointed by the king and not through elections.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> In 1909 a city council was established in Amman by Circassian <a>Ismael Babouk</a> who became the first-ever mayor of the capital, and in 1914 Amman's first city district center was founded.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Greater Amman Municipality (GAM) has been investing in making the city a better place, through a number of initiatives. Green Amman 2020 was initiated in 2014, aiming to turn the city to a <a>green metropolis</a> by 2020. According to official statistics, only 2.5% of Amman is <a>green space</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> In 2015 GAM and Zain Jordan started operating free-of-charge Wi-Fi services at 15 locations, including <a>Wakalat Street</a>, <a>Rainbow Street</a>, <a>The Hashemite Plaza</a>, Ashrafieh Cultural Complex, Zaha Cultural Center, Al Hussein Cultural Center, <a>Al Hussein Public Parks</a> and others.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup>

Amman is the 4th most visited Arab city and the ninth highest recipient of international visitor spending. Roughly 1.8 million tourists visited Amman in 2011 and spent over $1.3 billion in the city.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> The expansion of <a>Queen Alia International Airport</a> is an example of the Greater Amman Municipality's heavy investment in the city's infrastructure. The recent construction of a public transportation system and a national railway, and the expansion of roads, are intended to ease the traffic generated by the millions of annual visitors to the city.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>
The population of Amman reached 4,007,526 in 2015; the city contains about 42% of Jordan's entire population.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> It has a land area of 1,680 km<sup>2</sup> (648.7 sq mi) which yields a population density of about 2,380 inhabitants per square kilometer (6,200/sq mi).<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup> The population of Amman has risen exponentially with the successive waves of immigrants and refugees arriving throughout the 20th century. From a population of roughly 1,000 in 1890, Amman grew to around 1,000,000 inhabitants in 1990, primarily as a result of immigration, but also due to the high birthrate in the city.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup> Amman had been abandoned for centuries until hundreds of <a>Circassians</a> settled it in the 19th century. Today, about 40,000 Circassians live in Amman and its vicinity.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> After Amman became a major hub along the <a>Hejaz Railway</a> in 1914, many Muslim and Christian merchant families from al-Salt immigrated to the city.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> A large proportion of Amman's inhabitants have <a>Palestinian</a> roots (urban or rural origin), and the two main demographic groups in the city today are Arabs of Palestinian or Jordanian descent. Other ethnic groups comprise about 2% of the population. There are no official statistics about the proportion of people of Palestinian or Jordanian descent.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New arrivals consisting of Jordanians from the north and south of the country and immigrants from Palestine had increased the city's population from 30,000 in 1930 to 60,000 in 1947.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> About 10,000 Palestinians, mostly from <a>Safed</a>, <a>Haifa</a> and <a>Acre</a>, migrated to the city for economic opportunities before the <a>1948 war</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> Many of the immigrants from al-Salt from that time were originally from <a>Nablus</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup> The 1948 war caused an exodus of urban Muslim and Christian Palestinian refugees, mostly from <a>Jaffa</a>, <a>Ramla</a> and <a>Lydda</a>, to Amman,<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> whose population swelled to 110,000.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> With Jordan's capture of the <a>West Bank</a> during the war, many Palestinians from that area steadily migrated to Amman between 1950 and 1966, before another mass wave of Palestinian refugees from the West Bank moved to the city during the <a>1967 War</a>. By 1970, the population had swelled to an estimated 550,000.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> A further 200,000 Palestinians arrived after their expulsion from Kuwait during the 1991 <a>Gulf War</a>. Several large <a>Palestinian refugee camps</a> exist around the center of Amman.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup>

Because Amman lacks a deep-rooted native population, the city does not have a distinct Arabic <a>dialect</a>, although recently such a dialect utilizing the various Jordanian and Palestinian dialects, has been forming.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> The children of immigrants in the city are also increasingly referring to themselves as "Ammani", unlike much of the first-generation inhabitants who identify more with their respective places of origin.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup>

<p>
Amman has a mostly <a>Sunni Muslim</a> population, and the city contains numerous <a>mosques</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> Among the main mosques is the large <a>King Abdullah I Mosque</a>, built between 1982 and 1989. It is capped by a blue mosaic <a>dome</a> beneath which 3,000 Muslims may offer prayer. The Abu Darweesh Mosque, noted for its checkered black-and-white pattern, has an architectural style that is unique to Jordan.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> The mosque is situated on Jabal Ashrafieh, the highest point in the city. The mosque's interior is marked by light-colored walls and Persian carpets. During the 2004 Amman Message conference, edicts from various clergy-members afforded the following schools of thought as garnering collective recognition: <a>Hanafi</a>, <a>Hanbali</a>, <a>Maliki</a>, Shafi'i, Ja'fari, Zahiri, Zaydi, <a>Ibadi</a>, tassawuf-related <a>Sufism</a>, <a>Muwahhidism</a> and <a>Salafism</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> Amman also has a small <a>Druze</a> community.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Large numbers of <a>Christians</a> from throughout Jordan, particularly from al-Salt, have moved to Amman. Nearby <a>Fuheis</a> is a predominantly <a>Christian</a> town located to the northwest of the city.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup> A small <a>Armenian Catholic</a> community of around 70 families is present in the city.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup><a>Ecclesiastical courts</a>  for matters of personal status are also located in Amman. A total of 16 historic churches are located in <a>Umm ar-Rasas</a> ruins in <a>Al-Jeezah</a> district; the site is believed to have initially served as <a>Roman</a> fortified military camps which gradually became a town around the 5th century AD. It has not been completely excavated. It was influenced by several civilizations including the Romans, Byzantines and Muslims. The site contains some well-preserved mosaic floors, particularly the mosaic floor of the Church of Saint Stephen.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup>

<a>Downtown Amman</a>, the city center area (known in Arabic as <i>Al-Balad</i>), has been dwarfed by the sprawling urban area that surrounds it. Despite the changes, much remains of its old character. <a>Jabal Amman</a> is a well-known touristic attraction in old Amman, where the city's greatest souks, fine museums, ancient constructions, monuments, and cultural sites are found. Jabal Amman also contains the famous <a>Rainbow Street</a> and the cultural <a>Souk Jara</a> market.

Danielle Pergament of <i><a>The New York Times</a></i> described Ammani cuisine as a product of several cuisines in the region, writing that it combines "the bright vegetables from Lebanon, crunchy falafels from Syria, juicy kebabs from Egypt and, most recently, spicy meat dishes from Jordan's neighbor, Iraq. It's known as the food of the <a>Levant</a> – an ancient word for the area bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian peninsula. But the food here isn't just the sum of its calories. In this politically, religiously and ethnically fraught corner of the world, it is a symbol of bloodlines and identity."<sup><a href="#ref_138">[138]</a></sup> However, the city's street food scene makes the Ammani cuisine distinctive.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_139">[139]</a></sup>

Amman has an extensive road network, although the mountainous terrain of the area has prevented the connection of some main roads, which are instead connected by bridges and tunnels. The <a>Abdoun Bridge</a> spans <a>Wadi Abdoun</a> and connects the <a>4th Circle</a> to <a>Abdoun Circle</a>.

There are eight circles, or <a>roundabouts</a>, that span and connect west Amman. Successive waves of immigrants to the city has led to the rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when there are large numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting.<sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup> The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a solution in 2015.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup> In 2015, a <a>ring road</a> encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup>
