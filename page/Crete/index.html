<b>Crete</b> (<a>Greek</a>: <span>Κρήτη</span>, <small><a>Modern</a>:</small><i>Kríti</i> , <small><a>Ancient</a>:</small><i>Krḗtē</i><i>,</i><small></small><span><a>[krέːtεː]</a></span>  ) is the largest and most populous of the <a>Greek islands</a>, the <a>88th</a> largest island in the world and the <a>fifth</a> largest island in the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>, after <a>Sicily</a>, <a>Sardinia</a>, <a>Cyprus</a>, and <a>Corsica</a>. Crete rests approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland. It has an area of 8,336 km<sup>2</sup> (3,219 sq mi) and a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi).  It bounds the southern border of the <a>Aegean Sea</a>, with the <a>Sea of Crete</a> (or North Cretan Sea) to the north and the <a>Libyan Sea</a> (or South Cretan Sea) to the south.

</p>
<p>
Crete and a number of islands and islets that surround it constitute the Region of Crete (Greek: <span>Περιφέρεια Κρήτης</span>), which is the southernmost of the 13 <a>top-level administrative units of Greece</a>, and the fifth most populous of Greece's regions. Its capital and largest city is <a>Heraklion</a>, located on the north shore of the island. As of 2020<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, the region had a population of 636,504.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> The <a>Dodecanese</a> are located to the northeast of Crete, while the <a>Cyclades</a> are situated to the north, separated by the <a>Sea of Crete</a>. The <a>Peloponnese</a> is to the region's northwest.

</p>
<p>
Humans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the <a>Paleolithic</a> age. Crete was the centre of <a>Europe</a>'s first advanced civilization, the <a>Minoans</a>, from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the <a>Mycenaean civilization</a> from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the <a>Byzantine Empire</a>, <a>Andalusian</a><a>Arabs</a> , the <a>Venetian Republic</a>, and the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the <a>Cretan State</a>. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.

</p>
<p>
The island is mostly mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, <a>Mount Ida</a>, and the range of the <a>White Mountains</a> (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above 2000 metres in altitude and the <a>Samaria Gorge</a>, a <a>World Biosphere Reserve</a>. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own <a>poetry</a> and <a>music</a>). The <a>Nikos Kazantzakis</a> airport at Heraklion and the <a>Daskalogiannis</a> airport at <a>Chania</a> serve international travelers. The palace of <a>Knossos</a>, a Bronze Age settlement and ancient Minoan city, is also located in Heraklion.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>

<p>
The earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the <a>Syrian</a> city of <a>Mari</a> dating from the 18th century BC, where the island is referred to as <i>Kaptara</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> This is repeated later in <a>Neo-Assyrian</a> records and the <a>Bible</a> (<i><a>Caphtor</a></i>). It was known in ancient <a>Egyptian</a> as <i>Keftiu</i> or <i>kftı͗w</i>, strongly suggesting a similar <a>Minoan</a> name for the island.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The current name <i>Crete</i> is first attested in the 15th century BC in <a>Mycenaean Greek</a> texts, written in <a>Linear B</a>, through the words <i>ke-re-te</i> (<span><span>𐀐𐀩𐀳</span></span>, *<i>Krētes</i>; later Greek: <span>Κρῆτες</span><small></small><span><a>[krɛː.tes]</a></span> , plural of <span>Κρής</span><small></small><span><a>[krɛːs]</a></span> )<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> and <i>ke-re-si-jo</i> (<span><link></link><span>𐀐𐀩𐀯𐀍</span></span>, *<i>Krēsijos</i>; later Greek: <span>Κρήσιος</span><small></small><span><a>[krέːsios]</a></span> ,<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> 'Cretan').<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> In <a>Ancient Greek</a>, the name Crete (<span>Κρήτη</span>) first appears in <a>Homer</a>'s <i><a>Odyssey</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Its etymology is unknown.  One proposal derives it from a hypothetical <a>Luwian</a> word *<i>kursatta</i> (compare <i>kursawar</i> 'island', <i>kursattar</i> 'cutting, sliver').<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Another proposal suggests that it derives from the <a>ancient Greek</a> word <i>"κραταιή" (krataie̅)</i>, meaning strong or powerful, the reasoning being that Crete was the strongest <a>thalassocracy</a> during ancient times.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In <a>Latin</a>, the name of the island became <i>Creta</i>. The original Arabic name of Crete was <i>Iqrīṭiš</i> (<a>Arabic</a>: <span>اقريطش</span>‎ < <span>(τῆς) Κρήτης)</span>, but after the <a>Emirate of Crete</a>'s establishment of its new capital at <span>ربض الخندق</span><i>Rabḍ al-Ḫandaq</i>  (modern <a>Heraklion</a>; <a>Greek</a>: <span>Ηράκλειο</span>, <i>Irákleio</i>), both the city and the island became known as <span>Χάνδαξ</span> (<i>Chandax</i>) or <span>Χάνδακας</span> (<i>Chandakas</i>), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian <i>Candia</i>, from which were derived French <i>Candie</i> and English <i>Candy</i> or <i>Candia</i>. Under <a>Ottoman rule</a>, in <a>Ottoman Turkish</a>, Crete was called <i>Girit</i> (<span>كريد</span>). In the Hebrew Bible, Crete is referred to as (<span>כְּרֵתִים</span>) "kretim".

<p>
Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>. It is located in the southern part of the <a>Aegean Sea</a> separating the Aegean from the <a>Libyan Sea</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Island_morphology">Island morphology</h3>
<p>
The island has an elongated shape: it spans 260 km (160 mi) from east to west, is 60 km (37 mi) at its widest point, and narrows to as little as 12 km (7.5 mi) (close to <a>Ierapetra</a>). Crete covers an area of 8,336 km<sup>2</sup> (3,219 sq mi), with a coastline of 1,046 km (650 mi); to the north, it broaches the <a>Sea of Crete</a> (Greek: <span>Κρητικό Πέλαγος</span>); to the south, the <a>Libyan Sea</a> (Greek: <span>Λιβυκό Πέλαγος</span>); in the west, the <a>Myrtoan Sea</a>, and toward the east the Carpathian Sea. It lies approximately 160 km (99 mi) south of the Greek mainland.

</p>
<h3 id="Mountains_and%20valleys">Mountains and valleys</h3>
<p>
Crete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:

</p>
<ul><li>The White Mountains or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefka_Ori">Lefka Ori</a> 2,454 m (8,051 ft)</li><li>The Idi Range (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psiloritis">Psiloritis</a>) <link></link><span><a href="//geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Crete&params=35.18_N_24.82_E_">35°11′N 24°49′E﻿ / ﻿35.18°N 24.82°E﻿ / 35.18; 24.82</a></span> 2,456 m (8,058 ft)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterousia_Mountains">Asterousia Mountains</a> 1,231 m (4,039 ft)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kedros">Kedros</a> 1,777 m (5,830 ft)</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikti">Dikti Mountains</a> 2,148 m (7,047 ft)</li><li>Thripti 1,489 m (4,885 ft)</li></ul>
<p>
These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as <a>Amari valley</a>, fertile plateaus, such as <a>Lasithi plateau</a>, <a>Omalos</a> and <a>Nidha</a>; caves, such as <a>Gourgouthakas</a>, <a>Diktaion</a>, and <a>Idaion</a> (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god <a>Zeus</a>); and a number of gorges.

</p>
<p>
Mountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Gorges%2C_rivers%20and%20lakes">Gorges, rivers and lakes</h3>
<p>
The island has a number of gorges, such as the <a>Samariá Gorge</a>, <a>Imbros Gorge</a>, <a>Kourtaliotiko Gorge</a>, <a>Ha Gorge</a>, <a>Platania Gorge</a>, the Gorge of the Dead (at <a>Kato Zakros</a>, <a>Sitia</a>) and <a>Richtis Gorge</a> and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in <a>Sitia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The rivers of Crete include the <a>Ieropotamos River</a>, the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: Lake <a>Kournas</a> and Lake Agia, which are both in Chania regional unit.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup><a>Lake Voulismeni</a>  at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in Lasithi.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of <a>Aposelemis Dam</a>, the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.

A large number of islands, islets, and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by <a>archaeologists</a> and <a>biologists</a>. Some are <a>environmentally protected</a>. A small sample of the islands includes:

<p>
Off the south coast, the island of <a>Gavdos</a> is located 26 nautical miles (48 km) south of <a>Hora Sfakion</a> and is the <a>southernmost</a> point of <a>Europe</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Greece">Climate of Greece</a></div>
<p>
Crete straddles two climatic zones, the Mediterranean and the <a>North African</a>, mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily <a>Mediterranean</a>. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.

</p>
<p>
The south coast, including the <a>Mesara Plain</a> and <a>Asterousia Mountains</a>, falls in the North African climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, <a>date palms</a> bear fruit, and <a>swallows</a> remain year-round rather than migrate to <a>Africa</a>. The fertile region around <a>Ierapetra</a>, on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in <a>greenhouses</a> throughout the winter.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> Western Crete (Chania province) receives more rain and the soils there suffer more erosion compared to the Eastern part of Crete.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
Crete is the most populous island in Greece with a population of more than 600,000 people. Approximately 42% live in Crete's main cities and towns whilst 45% live in rural areas.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Administration">Administration</h3>
<p>
Crete with its nearby islands form the <b>Crete Region</b> (<a>Greek</a>: <span>Περιφέρεια Κρήτης</span>, <i>Periféria Krítis</i>, <small></small><span><a>[periˈferia ˈkritis]</a></span>), one of the 13 <a>regions of Greece</a> which were established in the 1987 administrative reform.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> Under the 2010 <a>Kallikratis plan</a>, the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at <a>Heraklion</a> and is divided into four <a>regional units</a> (pre-Kallikratis <a>prefectures</a>). From west to east these are: <a>Chania</a>, <a>Rethymno</a>, <a>Heraklion</a>, and <a>Lasithi</a>. These are further subdivided into 24 <a>municipalities</a>.

</p>
<p>
The region's governor is, since 1 January 2011, <a>Stavros Arnaoutakis</a>, who was elected in the <a>November 2010 local administration elections</a> for the <a>Panhellenic Socialist Movement</a>.

<p>
The economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup><sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
As in many regions of Greece, <a>viticulture</a> and <a>olive</a> groves are significant; <a>oranges</a>, <a>citrons</a> and <a>avocadoes</a> are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as <a>mizithra</a>, <a>anthotyros</a>, and <a>kefalotyri</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Gross domestic product</a> (GDP) of the region was €9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>

<p>
The island has three significant airports, <a>Nikos Kazantzakis</a> at Heraklion, the <a>Daskalogiannis</a> airport at <a>Chania</a> and a <a>smaller one</a> in <a>Sitia</a>. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.

<p>
The island is well served by ferries, mostly from <a>Piraeus</a>, by ferry companies such as <a>Minoan Lines</a> and <a>ANEK Lines</a>. <a>Seajets</a> operates routes to <a>Cyclades</a>.

Although almost everywhere is covered by the road network, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> In addition, a European Union study has been devised to promote a modern highway to connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. The study proposal includes a 15.7 km of section of road between the villages of Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete. Ut is hoped to benefit both tourists and locals by improving the connections to the southern part of the island and by reducing accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete's largest city Heraklion, which houses the island's main airport and principal ferry links with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

The investment falls under Greece's "Improvement of Accessibility" Operational Programme, which aims to improve the country's transport infrastructures as well as its international connections.

Total investment for the project "Completion of construction of the section of Ag. Varvara - Ag. Deka (Kastelli) (22+170 km to 37+900 km) of the vertical road axis Irakleio – Messara in the prefecture of Irakleio, Kriti" is EUR 102 273 321, of which the EU's European Regional Development Fund is contributing EUR 86 932 323 from the Operational Programme "Improvement of Accessibility" for the 2007 to 2013 programming period. Work falls under the priority "Road Transport – trans-European and trans-regional route network of the regions on the Convergence objective".<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>

Also, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete.

Hominids settled in Crete at least 130,000 years ago. In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the <a>Roman Empire</a>, the <a>Byzantine Empire</a>, the <a>Emirate of Crete</a>, the <a>Republic of Venice</a> and the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>. After a brief period of independence (1897–1913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by <a>Nazi Germany</a> during the <a>Second World War</a>.

Crete was the centre of Europe's first advanced civilization, the <a>Minoan</a> (<span>c. 2700–1420 BC</span>).<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> This civilization wrote in the undeciphered script known as <a>Linear A</a>. Early <a>Cretan</a> history is replete with legends such as those of <a>King Minos</a>, <a>Theseus</a> and the <a>Minotaur</a>, passed on orally via poets such as Homer. The <a>volcanic eruption</a> of <a>Thera</a> may have been the cause of the downfall of the Minoan civilization.

<p>
In 1420 BC, the Minoan civilization was overrun by the <a>Mycenaean civilization</a> from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by <a>Michael Ventris</a>, is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425–1375 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Archaic_and%20Classical%20period">Archaic and Classical period</h3>
<p>
After the <a>Bronze Age collapse</a>, Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the <a>Archaic period</a>. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and <a>Greek historiography</a> shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.

</p>
<p>
During the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The <a>Gortyn code</a> (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified <a>civil law</a> established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.

</p>
<p>
In the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, <a>Gortyn</a>, Kydonia (<a>Chania</a>), <a>Lyttos</a> and <a>Polyrrhenia</a> challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.

</p>
<p>
While the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like <a>Macedon</a> and its rivals <a>Rhodes</a> and <a>Ptolemaic Egypt</a>. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a <a>war between two opposing coalitions of cities</a>. As a result, the Macedonian king <a>Philip V</a> gained <a>hegemony</a> over Crete which lasted to the end of the <a>Cretan War (205–200 BC)</a>, when the <a>Rhodians</a> opposed the rise of Macedon and the <a>Romans</a> started to interfere in Cretan affairs.

</p>
<p>
In the 2nd century BC Ierapytna (<a>Ierapetra</a>) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.

Crete was involved in the <a>Mithridatic Wars</a>, initially repelling an attack by Roman general <a>Marcus Antonius Creticus</a> in 71 BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under <a>Quintus Caecilius Metellus</a>, equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69 BC, earning for Metellus the title "<i>Creticus</i>". <a>Gortyn</a> was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with <a>Cyrenaica</a> that was called <a>Creta et Cyrenaica</a>. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the <a>Panhellenion</a>, a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor <a>Hadrian</a>. When <a>Diocletian</a> redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the <a>diocese of Moesia</a>, and later by <a>Constantine I</a> to the <a>diocese of Macedonia</a>.

Crete was separated from Cyrenaica <abbr>c.</abbr><span> 297</span>.

In the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman, and then Eastern Roman (Byzantine) island, Crete was captured by <a>Andalusian</a><a>Muwallads</a>  led by <a>Abu Hafs</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> who established the <a>Emirate of Crete</a>. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under <a>Theoktistos</a>. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960/1, <a>Nikephoros Phokas</a>' <a>campaign</a> completely restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.

<p>
In 961, <a>Nikephoros Phokas</a> returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by <a>John Xenos</a> and <a>Nikon "the Metanoeite"</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of <a>Saracen</a> pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.

<p>
In 1204, the <a>Fourth Crusade</a> seized and sacked the imperial capital of <a>Constantinople</a>.

<p>
From 1212, during <a>Venice</a>'s rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a <a>Renaissance</a> swept through the island as is evident from the plethora of artistic works dating to that period. Known as <a>The Cretan School</a> or <a>Post-Byzantine Art</a>, it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. The most notable representatives of this Cretan renaissance were the painter <a>El Greco</a> and the writers <a>Nicholas Kalliakis</a> (1645–1707), <a>Georgios Kalafatis (professor)</a> (<abbr>c.</abbr><span> 1652</span>–1720), <a>Andreas Musalus</a> (<abbr>c.</abbr><span> 1665</span>–1721) and <a>Vitsentzos Kornaros</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>

In 1492, Jews expelled from Spain settled on the island.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> In 1574–77, Crete was under the rule of Giacomo Foscarini as Proveditor General, Sindace and <a>Inquisitor</a>. According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><a>Marco Foscarini</a>  was the Doge of Venice during this time period.

<p>
The <a>Ottomans</a><a>conquered Crete</a>  (Girit Eyâleti) in 1669, after the <a>siege of Candia</a>. Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the <a>Republic of Venice</a> after the <a>Ottoman–Venetian Wars</a>, some even prospering such as the family of <a>Simone Stratigo</a> (c. 1733 – c. 1824) who migrated to <a>Dalmatia</a> from Crete in 1669.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup><a>Islamic</a>  presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the <a>Arab occupation</a>, was cemented by the <a>Ottoman conquest</a>. Most <a>Cretan Muslims</a> were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan <a>Greek</a>, but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the <a>Greek War of Independence</a> (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> A number of <a>Sufi</a> orders were widespread throughout the island, the <a>Bektashi</a> order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five <a>tekkes</a>. Many <a>Cretan Turks</a> fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 <a>population exchange between Greece and Turkey</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During Easter of 1770, a notable revolt against Ottoman rule, in Crete, was started by <a>Daskalogiannis</a>, a shipowner from <a>Sfakia</a> who was promised support by <a>Orlov's fleet</a> which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.

</p>
<p>
Crete was left out of the modern Greek state by the <a>London Protocol of 1830</a>, and soon it was yielded to <a>Egypt</a> by the Ottoman <a>sultan</a>. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the <a>Convention of London</a> on 3 July 1840.

</p>
<p>
Heraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, "the deserted city".<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of <a>real-estate</a> transactions during the <a>Ottoman</a> rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869</a> or Great Cretan Revolution (Greek: <span>Κρητική Επανάσταση του 1866</span>) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the <i>Holocaust of Arkadi</i>. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the <a>Arkadi Monastery</a>, which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.

Following the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the <a>Great Powers</a> decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman <a>suzerainty</a> in the near future.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In September 1898 the <a>Candia massacre</a> in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians and 14 British servicemen dead at the hands of Muslim irregulars. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, <a>Prince George of Greece</a>, appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> The flag of the <a>Cretan State</a> was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.

<p>
In 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos 
over the question of the <i><a>enosis</a></i> (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the <a>Theriso revolt</a>, one of the leaders being <a>Eleftherios Venizelos</a>.

</p>
<p>
Prince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by <a>Alexandros Zaimis</a>, a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.

</p>
<p>
With the break out of the <a>First Balkan War</a>, the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>

<p>
In the aftermath of the <a>Dekemvriana</a> in Athens, Cretan leftists were targeted by the right wing paramilitary organization National Organization of Rethymno (EOR). Which engaged in attacks in the villages of Koxare and Melampes, as well as Rethymno in January 1945. Those attacks did not escalate into a full scale insurgency as they did in the Greek mainland and the Cretan <a>ELAS</a> did not surrender its weapons after the <a>Treaty of Varkiza</a>. An uneasy truce was maintained until 1947, with a series of arrests of notable communists in Chania and Heraklion. Encouraged by orders from the central organization in Athens, KKE launched an insurgency in Crete; marking the beginning of the <a>Greek Civil War</a> on the island. In eastern Crete the <a>Democratic Army of Greece</a> (DSE) struggled to establish its presence in <a>Dikti</a> and <a>Psilorites</a>. On 1 July 1947, the surviving 55 fighters of DSE were ambushed south of Psilorites, the few surviving members of the unit managed to join the rest of DSE in <a>Lefka Ori</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Lefka Ori region in the west offered more favorable conditions for DSE's insurgency. In the summer of 1947 DSE raided and looted the <a>Maleme Airport</a> and motor depot at Chrysopigi. Its numbers swelled to approximately 300 fighters, the rise of DSE numbers compounded with crop failure on the island created serious logistical issues for the insurgents. The communists resorted to <a>cattle rustling</a> and crop confiscations which solved the problem only temporarily. In the autumn of 1947, the Greek government offered generous amnesty terms to Cretan DSE fighters and mountain bandits, many of whom opted to abandon armed struggle or even defect to the nationalists. On 4 July 1948, government troops launched a large scale offensive on <a>Samariá Gorge</a>. Many DSE soldiers were killed in the fighting while the survivors broke into small armed bands. In October 1948, the secretary of the Cretan KKE Giorgos Tsitilos was killed in an ambush. By the following month only 34 DSE fighters remained active in Lefka Ori. The insurgency in Crete gradually withered away, with the last two hold outs surrendering in 1974, 25 years after the conclusion of the war in mainland Greece.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>

Crete is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion make up about <a>20% of all charter flights in Greece</a>. The number of hotel beds on the island increased by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.

</p>
<p>
Today, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and <a>Chania</a> and a smaller airport in <a>Sitia</a> (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012)<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, <a>Rethimno</a>, <a>Agios Nikolaos</a> and <a>Sitia</a>.

</p>
<p>
Popular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of <a>Chania</a>, the Venetian castle at <a>Rethymno</a>, the gorge of <a>Samaria</a>, the islands of <a>Chrysi</a>, <a>Elafonisi</a>, <a>Gramvousa</a>, <a>Spinalonga</a> and the Palm Beach of <a>Vai</a>, which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.

<h3 id="Transportation">Transportation</h3>
<p>
Crete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in Heraklion. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>

<p>
Crete's mild climate attracts interest from <a>northern Europeans</a> who want a holiday home or residence on the island. <a>EU</a> citizens have the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> In the cities of Heraklion and Chania, the average price per square metre of apartments ranges from €1,670 to €1,700.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> A growing number of real estate companies cater to mainly British immigrants, followed by <a>Dutch</a>, <a>German</a>, <a>Scandinavian</a> and other European nationalities wishing to own a home in Crete. The <a>British</a> immigrants are concentrated in the western regional units of <a>Chania</a> and <a>Rethymno</a> and to a lesser extent in <a>Heraklion</a> and <a>Lasithi</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>

The area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of <a>Knossos</a>, <a>Malia</a> (not to be confused with the town of the same name), <a>Petras</a> and <a>Phaistos</a>, the classical site of <a>Gortys</a>, and the diverse archaeology of the island of <a>Koufonisi</a>, which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to the latter has been restricted for the last few years, so it is best to check before heading to a port).

</p>
<p>
There are a number of museums throughout Crete. The <a>Heraklion Archaeological Museum</a> displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Harmful_effects">Harmful effects</h3>
<p>
Helen Briassoulis, in a qualitative analysis, proposed in the <i><a>Journal of Sustainable Tourism</a></i> that Crete is affected by tourism applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960 to 1970, 1970–1990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>

<p>
Crete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of <a>Hercules</a> (who took a live Cretan bull to the <a>Peloponnese</a>). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all "harmful" and "venomous" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the <a>Apostle Paul</a>, who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a <a>natural history museum</a>, the <a>Natural History Museum of Crete</a>, operating under the direction of the <a>University of Crete</a> and two aquariums – <a>Aquaworld</a> in <a>Hersonissos</a> and <a>Cretaquarium</a> in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.

<p>
The <a>Cretan shrew</a>, a type of <a>white-toothed shrew</a> is considered <a>endemic</a> to the island of Crete because this species of shrew is unknown elsewhere. It is a <a>relic species</a> of the <i>crocidura</i> shrews of which <a>fossils</a> have been found that can be dated to the <a>Pleistocene</a> era.

<p>
Tortoises can be seen throughout the island. Snakes can be found hiding under rocks. Toads and frogs reveal themselves when it rains.

</p>
<p>
Reptiles include the <a>Aegean wall lizard</a>, <a>Balkan green lizard</a>, <a>common chameleon</a>, <a>ocellated skink</a>, <a>snake-eyed skink</a>, <a>moorish gecko</a>, <a>Turkish gecko</a>, <a>Kotschy's gecko</a>, <a>spur-thighed tortoise</a>, and the <a>Caspian turtle</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>

There are four species of snake on the island and these are not dangerous to humans. The four species include the <a>leopard snake</a> (locally known as Ochendra), the <a>Balkan whip snake</a> (locally called Dendrogallia), the <a>dice snake</a> (called Nerofido in Greek), and the only venomous snake is the nocturnal <a>cat snake</a> which has evolved to deliver a weak venom at the back of its mouth to paralyse geckos and small lizards, and is not dangerous to humans.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Sea turtles include the <a>green turtle</a> and the <a>loggerhead turtle</a> which are both threatened species.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> The loggerhead turtle nests and hatches on north-coast beaches around Rethymno and Chania, and south-coast beaches along the gulf of Mesara.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Amphibians include the <a>European green toad</a>, <a>American bullfrog</a> (introduced), <a>European tree frog</a>, and the <a>Cretan marsh frog</a> (<a>endemic</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup>

Crete has an unusual variety of insects. <a>Cicadas</a>, known locally as <i>Tzitzikia</i>, make a distinctive repetitive <i>tzi tzi</i><a>sound</a>  that becomes louder and more frequent on hot summer days. Butterfly species include the <a>swallowtail butterfly</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> Moth species include the <a>hummingbird moth</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> There are several species of scorpion such as <a>Euscorpius</a> carpathicus whose venom is generally no more potent than a mosquito bite.

</p>
<p>
River crabs include the semi-terrestrial <i><a>Potamon potamios</a></i> crab.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> Edible snails are widespread and can cluster in the hundreds waiting for rainfall to reinvigorate them.

</p>
<p>
Apart from terrestrial mammals, the seas around Crete are rich in large marine mammals, a fact unknown to most Greeks at present, although reported since ancient times. Indeed, the Minoan frescoes depicting dolphins in Queen's Megaron at Knossos indicate that Minoans were well aware of and celebrated these creatures. Apart from the famous endangered <a>Mediterranean monk seal</a>, which lives in almost all the coasts of the country, Greece hosts <a>whales</a>, <a>sperm whales</a>, <a>dolphins</a> and <a>porpoises</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup> These are either permanent residents of the Mediterranean or just occasional visitors. The area south of Crete, known as the Greek Abyss, hosts many of them. <a>Squid</a> and <a>octopus</a> can be found along the coast and <a>sea turtles</a> and <a>hammerhead sharks</a> swim in the sea around the coast. The <a>Cretaquarium</a> and the <a>Aquaworld Aquarium</a>, are two of only three aquariums in the whole of Greece. They are located in <a>Gournes</a> and <a>Hersonissos</a> respectively.

Crete has a strong association with Ancient <a>Greek Gods</a> but is also connected with the <a>Minoan civilization</a>.

</p>
<p>
According to Greek Mythology, The <a>Diktaean Cave</a> at Mount <a>Dikti</a> was the birthplace of the god Zeus. The <a>Paximadia</a> islands were the birthplace of the goddess <a>Artemis</a> and the god <a>Apollo</a>. Their mother, the goddess <a>Leto</a>, was worshipped at <a>Phaistos</a>. The goddess <a>Athena</a> bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of <a>Dia</a>. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of <a>Lefkai</a> were the result of a musical contest between the <a>Sirens</a> and the <a>Muses</a>. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at <a>Aptera</a> ("featherless") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of <a>Souda</a> and <a>Leon</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup><a>Heracles</a> , in one of his labors, took the <a>Cretan bull</a> to the Peloponnese. <a>Europa</a> and Zeus made love at <a>Gortys</a> and conceived the kings of Crete: <a>Rhadamanthys</a>, <a>Sarpedon</a>, and Minos.

</p>
<p>
The <a>labyrinth</a> of the <a>Palace of Knossos</a> was the setting for the myth of <a>Theseus and the Minotaur</a> in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. <a>Icarus</a> and <a>Daedalus</a> were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death King Minos became a judge of the dead in <a>Hades</a>, while <a>Rhadamanthys</a> became the ruler of the Elysian fields.

Crete has its own distinctive <a>Mantinades</a> poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based <a>music</a> (typically performed with the <a>Cretan lyra</a> and the <a>laouto</a>) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the <a>Pentozali</a>. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Cretan authors have made important contributions to <a>Greek literature</a> throughout the modern period; major names include <a>Vikentios Kornaros</a>, creator of the 17th-century epic romance <i><a>Erotokritos</a></i> (Greek Ερωτόκριτος), and, in the 20th century, <a>Nikos Kazantzakis</a>. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the <a>Cretan School</a> of icon painting, which influenced <a>El Greco</a> and through him subsequent European painting.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Cretans are fiercely proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (<i>stivania</i>), <a><i>vráka</i> breeches</a> tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (<i>sariki</i>). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of masculinity.

</p>
<p>
Cretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan <a>vendettas</a> which persist on the island to date.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, a tradition lasting from the era of resistance against the <a>Ottoman Empire</a>. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup> Guns are subject to strict regulation from the Greek government, and in recent years a great deal of effort to control firearms in Crete has been undertaken by the Greek police, but with limited success.
