<p>
For a long time, the land was occupied by the natives of the region and suffered the attacks of the <a>Bandeirantes</a> that were looking for the <a>Guaranís</a>, who were able to find refuge in the jungle of the area.

</p>
<p>
After the <a>Paraguayan War</a>, vast expanses of land passed to the hands of foreign businessmen dedicated to exploiting <a>yerba mate</a> and lumber.

</p>

<p>
The population in the area was consolidated with the establishment of rural colonies dedicated to agriculture and livestock industries.
