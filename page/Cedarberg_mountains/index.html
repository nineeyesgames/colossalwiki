<div>This article is about the mountain range. For the municipality, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cederberg_Local_Municipality">Cederberg Local Municipality</a>. For the writer, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aki_Cederberg">Aki Cederberg</a>.</div>
<p>
The <b>Cederberg</b> mountains are located near <a>Clanwilliam</a>, approximately 300 km north of <a>Cape Town</a>, South Africa at about <link></link><span><a><span><span><span>32°30′S</span><span>19°0′E</span></span></span><span>﻿ / ﻿</span><span><span>32.500°S 19.000°E</span><span>﻿ / <span>-32.500; 19.000</span></span></span></a></span>. The mountain range is named after the endangered <a>Clanwilliam cedar</a> (<i>Widdringtonia wallichii</i>), which is a tree <a>endemic</a> to the area. The mountains are noted for dramatic <a>rock formations</a> and <a>San</a><a>rock art</a> . The Cederberg Wilderness Area is administered by <a>CapeNature</a>.

</p>
<p>
<i>Cederberg</i> is now the generally accepted spelling for the area, which combines the English (<b>Cedarberg</b>) and <a>Afrikaans</a> (<b>Sederberg</b>) variants.

<p>
The Cederberg mountains extend about 50 km north-south by 20 km east-west. They are bordered on the west by the <a>Sandveld</a>, the north by the <a>Pakhuis Mountains</a>, the east by the <a>Springbok Flats</a> and the south by the <a>Kouebokkeveld Mountains</a> and the <a>Skurweberge</a>. The main access road, the <a>N7</a>, runs to the west of the range. The nearest towns are <a>Citrusdal</a> to the southwest and <a>Clanwilliam</a> to the north. The area is sparsely populated.

</p>
<p>
There are several notable mountains in the range, including Sneeuberg (2026 m) and Tafelberg (1969 m). Tafelberg (<a>Afrikaans</a> for "Table Mountain") should not be confused with the <a>Table Mountain</a> in <a>Cape Town</a>. Notable landmarks include the Maltese Cross, Wolfberg Arch and Wolfberg Cracks.

</p>
<p>
The dominating characteristic of the area is sharply defined <a>sandstone</a> rock formations (<a>Table Mountain Group</a>), often reddish in colour. This group of rocks contains bands of <a>shale</a> and in recent years a few important <a>fossils</a> have been discovered in these argillaceous layers. The fossils are of primitive fish and date back 450 million years to the <a>Ordovician</a> Period.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The summers are very hot and dry, while the winters are wetter and cold with typical annual rainfall in the low-lying areas of less than 700 mm. The higher peaks receive a dusting of snow in winter. Summer days are typically clear and cloudless. Due to the clear skies most of the year, it makes an excellent site for <a>skywatching</a> and has its own amateur <a>observatory</a>.

</p>
<h2 id="Flora_and%20fauna">Flora and fauna</h2>
<p>
The predominant vegetation is Mediterranean <a>fynbos</a> in the wetter south and west, changing to semi desert scrub in the north and east. The <a>endangered</a><a>Clanwilliam cedar</a>  (<i>Widdringtonia wallichii</i>) of the <a>family</a><a>Cupressaceae</a>  and the <a>snow protea</a> (<i>Protea cryophila</i>) of the <a>Proteaceae</a> are <a>endemic</a> to the area, found only in more remote areas high up in the mountains.

</p>
<p>
The area's <a>apex predators</a> are the <a>felids</a><a>leopard</a>  (<i>Panthera pardus</i>) and <a>caracal</a> (<i>Caracal caracal</i>). Other mammals include the <a>rock hyrax</a> (<i>Procavia capensis</i>) or "dassie", <a>meerkats</a> (<i>Suricata suricatta</i>) and other <a>mongooses</a> (<a>Herpestidae</a>), larger <a>antelopes</a> (e.g. <a>bontebok</a><i>Damaliscus pygargus dorcas</i>  and <a>gemsbok</a><i>Oryx gazella</i> ), the <a>vulnerable</a><a>Cape mountain zebra</a>  (<i>Equus zebra zebra</i>), and <a>chacma baboons</a> (<i>Papio ursinus</i>). There are also many birds, small mammals, <a>reptiles</a> and insects.

</p>
<p>
Other <a>threatened species</a> found in the Cederberg Wilderness Area include the <a>cyprinids</a><a>Clanwilliam yellowfish</a>  (<i>Labeobarbus capensis</i>, vulnerable), <a>Clanwilliam redfin</a> (<i>Barbus calidus</i>, vulnerable) and <a>sawfin</a> (<i>Barbus serra</i>, endangered).

<p>
In caves and overhangs throughout the area, <a>San</a><a>rock art</a>  can be found, evidence of the earliest human inhabitants. European settlement brought forestry and some agriculture, and led to massive destruction of the local cedar trees, with thousands felled for <a>telephone poles</a>, furniture and housing. The European arrival also led to the elimination of the San population. In the north, the old <a>Moravian</a><a>mission</a>  station of <a>Wupperthal</a> still remains, the heart of a small subsistence farming community, and home to a local industry producing <i>veldskoene</i>, traditional soft leather shoes.

</p>
<p>
The Cederberg was possibly the southernmost battleground of the <a>Second Boer War</a>. A small band of <a>Boer</a><a>guerrillas</a>  penetrated into this area from the <a>Boer republics</a>, hundreds of kilometres to the north, hoping to stir up popular support amongst the local farmers of <a>Dutch</a> descent. In this they failed; the farmers may have had little sympathy for the <a>British</a> but they had a fair notion of who was going to win the war. It is said that the Boer commandos were confronted in the Cederberg by a lone Englishman, who ordered them to surrender. They laughed at him, because he was one and they were many and tried to reason with him, pointing out the hopelessness of his position. He refused to back down and was in the end shot dead. The place where he fell is today called <i>Engelsmanskloof</i> ("Englishman's ravine").

</p>
<h3 id="Agriculture">Agriculture</h3>
<p>
<a>Arable land</a> is limited by the altitude, the dry climate, and the rocky terrain, and few farms exist. <a>Rooibos</a> tea is the area's most famous export, though fruit and tobacco are also harvested on some farms. The Cederberg area includes one <a>winery</a>, the highest in South Africa.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> Around the Wupperthal area are a number of <a>subsistence farms</a>. Some commercial <a>pine</a> plantations remain around the Algeria forest station. <a>Proteas</a> and other <a>fynbos</a> plants are also grown. A number of farms have become predominantly guest farms catering for the local and international tourist market.

</p>
<h3 id="Tourism">Tourism</h3>
<p>
As a wilderness area, the primary activity is <a>eco-tourism</a>, including <a>camping</a>, <a>rock climbing</a> and hiking. The main campsite, Algeria, is operated by <a>CapeNature</a>, while others such as Sanddrif, Driehoek, Jamaka and Kromrivier are privately operated.

</p>
<p>
The Cederberg is renowned for its quality of rock climbing routes particularly around the Krakadouw and Tafelberg peaks. The Table Mountain Sandstone creates ideal conditions for spectacular routes. There are numerous day and overnight hikes including the popular and spectacular Wolfberg Arch, Wolfberg Cracks and the Maltese Cross.

</p>
<p>
The area is also home to an amateur astronomical observatory, which regularly hosts open evenings for the public.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are various 4x4 routes.

</p>
<p>
A large tract of the northern Cederberg is owned by the <a>Moravian Church</a>. The quaint village of <a>Wupperthal</a> forms part of a mission station route that provides visitors with an interesting view of rural life. The village is also a well known centre for hand-made leather shoes and boots. One of the "buite stasies" (directly translated as outer stations) is Heuningvlei, a small picturesque hamlet that is in the process of developing a donkey cart trail from the summit of <a>Pakhuis Pass</a> to the hamlet. The project, a poverty alleviation project funded by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, includes the creation of backpacking accommodation, herb garden and various other tourism offerings.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Scouting">Scouting</h3>
<p>
The Cederberg is also the site of the <a>Senior Scout Adventure</a>, a 12-day event for <a>Scouts</a> run every second year by <a>Scouts South Africa</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
