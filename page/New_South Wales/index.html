<p>
<b>New South Wales</b> (abbreviated as <b>NSW</b>) is a <a>state</a> on the <a>east coast</a> of <a>Australia</a>. It borders three other states, <a>Queensland</a> to the north, <a>Victoria</a> to the south, and <a>South Australia</a> to the west. Its coast borders the <a>Coral</a> and <a>Tasman Seas</a> to the east.  The <a>Australian Capital Territory</a> is an enclave within the state. New South Wales' state capital is <a>Sydney</a>, which is also Australia's most populous city. In June 2020<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, the population of New South Wales was over 8.1 million,<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> making it Australia's most populous state. Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 5.3 million, live in the Greater Sydney area.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> The demonym for inhabitants of New South Wales is <i>New South Welshmen</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Colony of New South Wales</a> was founded as a British <a>penal colony</a> in 1788. It originally comprised more than half of the <a>Australian mainland</a> with its <a>western boundary</a> set at <a>129th meridian east</a> in 1825. The colony then also included the island territories of <a>Van Diemen's Land</a>, <a>Lord Howe Island</a>, and <a>Norfolk Island</a>. During the 19th century, <a>most of the colony's area was detached</a> to form separate <a>British colonies</a> that eventually became the various <a>states and territories of Australia</a>. However, the <a>Swan River Colony</a> was never administered as part of New South Wales.

</p>
<p>
Lord Howe Island remains part of New South Wales, while Norfolk Island has become a <a>federal territory</a>, as have the areas now known as the Australian Capital Territory and the <a>Jervis Bay Territory</a>.

<p>
The original inhabitants of New South Wales were the <a>Aboriginal</a><a>tribes</a>  who arrived in Australia about 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. Before European settlement there were an estimated 250,000 Aboriginal people in the region.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Wodi wodi</a> people are the original custodians of the <a>Illawarra</a> region of South Sydney.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> Speaking a variant of the <a>Dharawal</a> language, the Wodi Wodi peoples lived across a large stretch of land which was roughly surrounded by what is now known as <a>Campbelltown</a>, <a>Shoalhaven River</a> and <a>Moss Vale</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Bundjalung people</a> are the original custodians of parts of the <a>northern coastal areas</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are other Aboriginal peoples whose traditional lands are within what is now New South Wales, including the <a>Wiradjiri</a>, <a>Gamilaray</a>, <a>Yuin</a>, <a>Ngarigo</a>, <a>Gweagal</a>, and <a>Ngiyampaa</a> peoples.

<p>
In 1770 <a>Lieutenant James Cook</a> charted the unmapped eastern coast of the continent of <a>New Holland</a>, now Australia, and claimed the entire coastline that he had just explored as British territory without having gained the consent of the Indigenous inhabitants.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Cook first named the land New Wales which was later amended to New South Wales (NSW).<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In January 1788 <a>Arthur Phillip</a> arrived in Botany Bay with the <a>First Fleet</a> of 11 vessels, which carried over a thousand settlers, including 736 convicts.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> A few days after arrival at <a>Botany Bay</a>, the fleet moved to the more suitable <a>Port Jackson</a>, where Phillip established a settlement at the place he named <a>Sydney Cove</a> (in honour of the Secretary of State, <a>Lord Sydney</a>) on 26 January 1788.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> This date later became Australia's national day, <a>Australia Day</a>. The colony was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on 7 February 1788 at Sydney.  Phillip, as <a>Governor of New South Wales</a>, exercised nominal authority over all of Australia east of the <a>135th meridian east</a> between the latitudes of 10°37'S and 43°39'S, an area which includes modern New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> He remained as governor until 1792.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The settlement was initially planned to be a self-sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture. Trade and ship building were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated. However, after the departure of governor Phillip, the colony's military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods obtained from visiting ships. Former convicts also farmed land granted to them and engaged in trade. Farms spread to the more fertile lands surrounding <a>Paramatta</a>, <a>Windsor</a> and <a>Camden</a>, and by 1803 the colony was self-sufficient in grain. Boat building developed in order to make travel easier and exploit the marine resources of the coastal settlements. Sealing and whaling became important industries.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In March 1804, several hundred <a>United Irish</a> exiles in the <a>Castle Hill</a> area (now a suburb of Sydney) conspired to seize control of the colony and to capture ships for a return to Ireland.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> Poorly armed, and with their leader Philip Cunningham captured,<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> the main body of insurgents were routed in an encounter loyalists—recalling the decisive <a>rebel defeat in Ireland in 1798</a>—celebrated as the <a>Second Battle of Vinegar Hill.</a> Fifteen were killed and nine executed.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Lachlan Macquarie</a> (governor 1810-1821) commissioned the construction of roads, wharves, churches and public buildings, sent explorers out from Sydney and employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> A road across the <a>Blue Mountains</a> was completed in 1815, opening the way for large scale farming and grazing in the lightly-wooded pastures west of the <a>Great Dividing Range</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1825 Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) became a separate colony and the western border of New South Wales was extended to the 129th meridian east (now the West Australian border).<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
From the 1820s <a>squatters</a> increasingly established unauthorised cattle and sheep runs beyond the official limits of the settled colony. In 1836 an annual licence was introduced in an attempt to control the pastoral industry, but booming wool prices and the high cost of land in the settled areas encouraged further squatting. The expansion of the pastoral industry led to violent episodes of conflict between settlers and traditional Aboriginal landowners, such as the <a>Myall Creek massacre</a> of 1838.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> By 1844 wool accounted for half of the colony's exports and by 1850 most of the eastern third of New South Wales was controlled by fewer than 2,000 pastoralists.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The transportation of convicts to New South Wales ended in 1840, and in 1842 a Legislative Council was introduced, with two-thirds of its members elected and one-third appointed by the governor. Former convicts were granted the vote, but a property qualification meant that only one in five adult males were enfranchised.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By 1850 the settler population of New South Wales had grown to 180,000, not including the 70,000 living in the area which became the separate colony of Victoria in 1851.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="1850s_to%201890s">1850s to 1890s</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/George_Street_Sydney_1883.jpg/220px-George_Street_Sydney_1883.jpg" alt="null"></div>

<p>
In 1856 New South Wales achieved responsible government with the introduction of a bicameral parliament comprising a directly elected <a>Legislative Assembly</a> and a nominated <a>Legislative Council</a>. The property qualification for voters had been reduced in 1851, and by 1856 95 per cent of adult males in Sydney, and 55 per cent in the colony as a whole, were eligible to vote. Full adult male suffrage was introduced in 1858. In 1859 Queensland became a separate colony.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1861 the NSW parliament legislated <a>land reforms</a> intended to encourage family farms and mixed farming and grazing ventures. The amount of land under cultivation subsequently grew from 246,000 acres in 1861 to 800,000 acres in the 1880s. Wool production also continued to grow, and by the 1880s New South Wales produced almost half of Australia's wool. Coal had been discovered in the early years of settlement and gold in 1851, and by the 1890s wool, gold and coal were the main exports of the colony.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The NSW economy also became more diversified. From the 1860s, New South Wales had more people employed in manufacturing than any other Australian colony. The NSW government also invested heavily in infrastructure such as railways, telegraph, roads, ports, water and sewerage. By 1889 it was possibly to travel by train from Brisbane to Adelaide via Sydney and Melbourne. The extension of the rail network inland also encouraged regional industries and the development of the <a>wheat belt</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the 1880s trade unions grew and were extended to lower skilled workers. In 1890 a strike in the shipping industry spread to wharves, railways, mines and shearing sheds. The defeat of the strike was one of the factors leading the <a>Trades and Labor Council</a> to form a political party. The <a>Labor Electoral League</a> won a quarter of seats in the NSW elections of 1891 and held the balance of power between the <a>Free Trade Party</a> and the <a>Protectionist Party</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="1901_Federation%20of%20Australia">1901 Federation of Australia</h3>
<p>
A <a>Federal Council of Australasia</a> was formed in 1885 but New South Wales declined to join. A major obstacle to the federation of the Australian colonies was the <a>protectionist</a> policies of Victoria which conflicted with the free trade policies dominant in New South Wales. Nevertheless, the NSW premier <a>Henry Parkes</a> was a strong advocate of <a>federation</a> and his <a>Tenterfield Oration</a> in 1889 was pivotal in gathering support for the cause. Parkes also struck a deal with <a>Edmund Barton</a>, leader of the NSW Protectionist Party, whereby they would work together for federation and leave the question of a protective tariff for a future Australian government to decide.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In early 1893 the first citizens' Federation League was established in the Riverina region of New South Wales and many other leagues were soon formed in the colony. The leagues organised a conference in <a>Corowa</a> in July 1893 which developed a plan for federation. The new NSW premier, <a>George Reid</a>, endorsed the "Corowa plan" and in 1895 convinced the majority of other premiers to adopt it. A constitutional convention held sessions in 1897 and 1898 which resulted in a proposed constitution for a Commonwealth of federated states. However, a referendum on the constitution failed to gain the required majority in New South Wales after that colony's Labor party campaigned against it and premier Reid gave it such qualified support that he earned the nickname "yes-no Reid".<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The premiers of the other colonies agreed to a number of concessions to New South Wales (particularly that the future Commonwealth capital would be located in NSW), and in 1899 further referendums were held in all the colonies except Western Australia. All resulted in yes votes, with the yes vote in New South Wales meeting the required majority. The <a>imperial parliament</a> passed the necessary enabling legislation in 1900 and Western Australia subsequently voted to join the new federation. The Commonwealth of Australia was inaugurated on 1 January 1901, and Barton was sworn in as Australia's first prime minister.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>

<p>
The first post-federation NSW governments were <a>Progressive</a> or <a>Liberal Reform</a> and implemented a range of social reforms with Labor support. Women won the right to vote in NSW elections in 1902, but were ineligible to stand for parliament until 1918. Labor increased its parliamentary representation in every election from 1904 before coming to power in 1910 with a majority of one seat.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 saw more NSW volunteers for service than the federal authorities could handle, leading to unrest in camps as recruits waited for transfer overseas. In 1916 NSW premier <a>William Holman</a> and a number of his supporters were expelled from the Labor party over their support for military conscription. Holman subsequently formed a <a>Nationalist</a> government which remained in power until 1920. Despite a huge victory for Holman's pro-conscription Nationalists in the elections of March 1917, a second referendum on conscription held in December that year was defeated in New South Wales and nationally.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Following the war, NSW governments embarked on large public works programs including road building, the extension and electrification of the rail network and construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The works were largely funded by loans from London, leading to a debt crisis after the onset of the <a>Great Depression</a> in 1929. New South Wales was hit harder by the depression than other states, and by 1932 one third of union members in the state were unemployed, compared with 20 per cent nationally.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Labor won the November 1930 NSW elections and <a>Jack Lang</a> became premier for the second time. In 1931 Lang proposed a plan to deal with the depression which included a suspension of interest payments to British creditors, diverting the money to unemployment relief. The Commonwealth and state premiers rejected the plan and later that year Lang's supporters in the Commonwealth parliament brought down <a>James Scullin's</a> federal Labor government. The NSW Lang government subsequently defaulted on overseas interest payments and was dismissed from office in May 1932 by the governor, <a>Sir Phillip Game</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The following elections were won comfortably by the United Australia Party in coalition with the Country Party. <a>Bertram Stevens</a> became premier, remaining in office until 1939, when he was replaced by <a>Alexander Mair</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A contemporary study by sociologist A. P. Elkin found that the population of New South Wales responded to the outbreak of war in 1939 with pessimism and apathy. This changed with the threat of invasion by Japan, which entered the war in December 1941. In May 1942 three Japanese midget submarines entered Sydney harbour and sank a naval ship, killing 29 men aboard. The following month Sydney and Newcastle were shelled by Japanese warships. American troops began arriving in the state in large numbers. Manufacturing, steelmaking, shipbuilding and rail transport all grew with the war effort and unemployment virtually disappeared.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A Labor government led by <a>William McKell</a> was elected in May 1941. The McKell government benefited from full employment, budget surpluses and a co-operative relationship with John Curtin's federal Labor government. McKell became the first Labor leader to serve a full term and to be re-elected for a second. The Labor party was to govern New South Wales until 1965.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Post-war_period">Post-war period</h3>
<p>
The Labor government introduced two-weeks paid leave for most NSW workers in 1944, and the 40 hour working week was implemented by 1947. The post-war economic boom brought full employment and rising living standards, and the government engaged in large spending programs on housing, dams, electricity generation and other infrastructure. In 1954 the government announced a plan for the construction of an opera house on <a>Bennelong Point</a>. The design competition was won by <a>Jørn Utzon</a>. Controversy over the cost of the <a>Sydney Opera House</a> and construction delays became a political issue and was a factor in the eventual defeat of Labor in 1965 by the conservative <a>Liberal Party</a> and <a>Country Party</a> coalition led by <a>Robert Askin</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Askin government promoted private development, law and order issues and greater state support for non-government schools. However, Askin, a former bookmaker, became increasingly associated with illegal bookmaking, gambling and police corruption.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the late 1960s, a <a>secessionist movement</a> in the <a>New England</a> region of the state led to a 1967 referendum on the issue which was narrowly defeated. The new state would have consisted of much of northern NSW including <a>Newcastle</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Sydney_Opera_House_-_Dec_2008.jpg/220px-Sydney_Opera_House_-_Dec_2008.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Askin's resignation in 1975 was followed by a number of short lived premierships by Liberal Party leaders. When a general election came in 1976 the ALP under <a>Neville Wran</a> came to power.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> Wran was able to transform this narrow one seat victory into landslide wins (known as Wranslides) in 1978 and 1981.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After winning a comfortable though reduced majority in 1984, Wran resigned as premier and left parliament. His replacement <a>Barrie Unsworth</a> struggled to emerge from Wran's shadow and lost a 1988 election against a resurgent Liberal Party led by <a>Nick Greiner</a>. The Greiner government embarked on an efficiency program involving public sector cost-cutting, the corporatisation of government agencies and the privatisation of some government services. An <a>Independent Commission Against Corruption</a> (ICAC) was created.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> Greiner called a snap election in 1991 which the Liberals were expected to win. However the ALP polled extremely well and the Liberals lost their majority and needed the support of independents to retain power.

</p>
<p>
In 1992 Greiner was investigated by ICAC for possible corruption over the offer of a public service position to a former Liberal MP. Greiner resigned but was later cleared of corruption. His replacement as Liberal leader and Premier was <a>John Fahey</a>, whose government narrowly lost the 1995 election to the ALP under <a>Bob Carr</a>, who was to become the longest serving premier of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Carr government (1995–2005) largely continued its predecessors' focus on the efficient delivery of government services such as health, education, transport and electricity. There was an increasing emphasis on public-private partnerships to deliver infrastructure such as freeways, tunnels and rail links. The Carr government gained popularity for its successful organisation of international events, especially the 2000 Sydney Olympics, but Carr himself was critical of the federal government over its high immigration intake, arguing that a disproportionate number of new migrants were settling in Sydney, putting undue pressure on state infrastructure.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Carr unexpectedly resigned from office in 2005 and was replaced by <a>Morris Iemma</a>, who remained premier after being re-elected in the <a>March 2007 state election</a>, until he was replaced by <a>Nathan Rees</a> in September 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> Rees was subsequently replaced by <a>Kristina Keneally</a> in December 2009, who became the first female premier of New South Wales.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> Keneally's government was defeated at the <a>2011 state election</a> and <a>Barry O'Farrell</a> became Premier on 28 March. On 17 April 2014 O'Farrell stood down as Premier after misleading an ICAC investigation concerning a gift of a bottle of wine.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> The Liberal Party then elected Treasurer <a>Mike Baird</a> as party leader and Premier. Baird resigned as Premier on 23 January 2017, and was replaced by <a>Gladys Berejiklian</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 23 March 2019, Berejiklian led the Coalition to a third term in office. She maintained high personal approval ratings for her management of a bushfire crisis and the <a>COVID-19 pandemic</a>. However, in September 2021, ICAC announced it was investigating whether Berejiklian breached public trust when she awarded grants to several community organisations between 2012 and 2018. Berejiklian resigned as premier and was replaced by <a>Dominic Perrottet</a> on 5 October.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>

New South Wales is bordered on the north by Queensland, on the west by South Australia, on the south by Victoria and on the east by the <a>Coral</a> and <a>Tasman Seas</a>. The <a>Australian Capital Territory</a> and the <a>Jervis Bay Territory</a> form a separately administered entity that is bordered entirely by New South Wales. The state can be divided geographically into four areas. New South Wales's three largest cities, <a>Sydney</a>, <a>Newcastle</a> and <a>Wollongong</a>, lie near the centre of a narrow coastal strip extending from cool temperate areas on the far south coast to <a>subtropical</a> areas near the Queensland border.

The <a>Illawarra</a> region is centred on the city of Wollongong, with the <a>Shoalhaven</a>, <a>Eurobodalla</a> and the <a>Sapphire Coast</a> to the south. The <a>Central Coast</a> lies between Sydney and Newcastle, with the <a>Mid North Coast</a> and <a>Northern Rivers</a> regions reaching northwards to the Queensland border. Tourism is important to the economies of coastal towns such as <a>Coffs Harbour</a>, <a>Lismore</a>, <a>Nowra</a> and <a>Port Macquarie</a>, but the region also produces seafood, beef, dairy, fruit, sugar cane and timber.

<p>
The <a>Great Dividing Range</a> extends from Victoria in the south through New South Wales to Queensland, parallel to the narrow coastal plain. This area includes the <a>Snowy Mountains</a>, the <a>Northern</a>, <a>Central</a> and <a>Southern Tablelands</a>, the <a>Southern Highlands</a> and the <a>South West Slopes</a>. Whilst not particularly steep, many peaks of the range rise above 1,000 metres (3,281 ft), with the highest <a>Mount Kosciuszko</a> at 2,229 m (7,313 ft). <a>Skiing in Australia</a> began in this region at <a>Kiandra</a> around 1861. The relatively short ski season underwrites the tourist industry in the <a>Snowy Mountains</a>. Agriculture, particularly the wool industry, is important throughout the highlands. Major centres include <a>Armidale</a>, <a>Bathurst</a>, <a>Bowral</a>, <a>Goulburn</a>, <a>Inverell</a>, <a>Orange</a>, <a>Queanbeyan</a> and <a>Tamworth</a>.

</p>
<p>
There are numerous forests in New South Wales, with such tree species as Red Gum <a>Eucalyptus</a> and Crow Ash (<i><a>Flindersia australis</a></i>), being represented.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> Forest floors have a diverse set of understory shrubs and fungi. One of the widespread fungi is <a>Witch's Butter</a> (<i><a>Tremella mesenterica</a></i>).<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>western slopes and plains</a> fill a significant portion of the state's area and have a much sparser population than areas nearer the coast. Agriculture is central to the economy of the western slopes, particularly the <a>Riverina</a> region and <a>Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area</a> in the state's south-west. Regional cities such as <a>Albury</a>, <a>Dubbo</a>, <a>Griffith</a> and <a>Wagga Wagga</a> and towns such as <a>Deniliquin</a>, <a>Leeton</a> and <a>Parkes</a> exist primarily to service these agricultural regions. The western slopes descend slowly to the western plains that comprise almost two-thirds of the state and are largely arid or semi-arid. The mining town of <a>Broken Hill</a> is the largest centre in this area.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
One possible definition of the centre for New South Wales is located 33 kilometres (21 mi) west-north-west of <a>Tottenham</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>

<p>
A little more than half of the state has an <a>arid</a> to <a>semi arid</a> climate, where the rainfall averages from 150 to 500 millimetres (5.9 to 19.7 in) a year throughout most of this climate zone. Summer temperatures can be very hot, while winter nights can be quite cold in this region. Rainfall varies throughout the state. The far north-west receives the least, less than 180 mm (7 in) annually, while the east receives between 700 to 1,400 mm (28 to 55 in) of rain.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The climate along the flat, <a>coastal plain</a> east of the range varies from <a>oceanic</a> in the south to <a>humid subtropical</a> in the northern half of the state, right above <a>Wollongong</a>. Rainfall is highest in this area; however, it still varies from around 800 millimetres (31 in) to as high as 3,000 millimetres (120 in) in the wettest areas, for example <a>Dorrigo</a>. In the state's south, on the westward side of the <a>Great Dividing Range</a>, rainfall is heaviest in winter due to <a>cold fronts</a> which move across <a>southern Australia</a>, while in the north, around <a>Lismore</a>, rain is heaviest in summer from tropical systems and occasionally even <a>cyclones</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> During late winter, the coastal plain is relatively dry due to <a>foehn winds</a> that originate from the Great Dividing Range;<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> the mountain range <a>block</a> the moist, <a>westerly</a> cold fronts that arrive from the <a>Southern Ocean</a>, whereby providing generally <a>clear conditions</a> on the <a>leeward</a> side.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The climate in the southern half of the state is generally warm to hot in summer and cool in the winter. The seasons are more defined in the southern half of the state, especially as one moves inland towards <a>South West Slopes</a>, <a>Central West</a> and the <a>Riverina</a> region. The climate in the <a>northeast region</a> of the state, or the <a>North Coast</a>, bordering <a>Queensland</a>, is hot and humid in the summer and mild in winter. The <a>Northern Tablelands</a>, which are also on the North coast, have relatively mild summers and cold winters, due to their high elevation on the Great Dividing Range.

</p>
<p>
Peaks along the Great Dividing Range vary from 500 metres (1,640 ft) to over 2,000 metres (6,562 ft) above sea level. Temperatures can be cool to cold in winter with frequent <a>frosts</a> and <a>snowfall</a>, and are rarely hot in summer due to the elevation. <a>Lithgow</a> has a climate typical of the range, as do the regional cities of <a>Orange</a>, <a>Cooma</a>, <a>Oberon</a> and <a>Armidale</a>. Such places fall within the <a>subtropical highland</a> (<i>Cwb</i>) variety. Rainfall is moderate in this area, ranging from 600 to 800 mm (24 to 31 in).

</p>
<p>
Snowfall is common in the higher parts of the range, sometimes occurring as far north as the <a>Queensland</a> border. On the highest peaks of the <a>Snowy Mountains</a>, the climate can be <a>subpolar oceanic</a> and even <a>alpine</a> on the higher peaks with very cold temperatures and heavy snow. The <a>Blue Mountains</a>, <a>Southern Tablelands</a> and <a>Central Tablelands</a>, which are situated on the Great Dividing Range, have mild to warm summers and cold winters, although not as severe as those in the Snowy Mountains.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The highest maximum temperature recorded was 49.7 °C (121 °F) at <a>Menindee</a> in the west of the state on 10 January 1939. The lowest minimum temperature was −23 °C (−9 °F) at <a>Charlotte Pass</a> in the Snowy Mountains on 29 June 1994. This is also the lowest temperature recorded in the whole of Australia excluding the Antarctic Territory.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

<p>
Executive authority is vested in the <a>Governor of New South Wales</a>, who represents and is appointed by <a>Elizabeth II</a>, <a>Queen of Australia</a>. The current governor is <a>Margaret Beazley</a>. The governor commissions as premier the leader of the parliamentary political party that can command a simple majority of votes in the Legislative Assembly. The premier then recommends the appointment of other members of the two Houses to the Ministry, under the principle of responsible or <a>Westminster government</a>. As in other Westminster systems, there is no constitutional requirement in New South Wales for the government to be formed from the parliament—merely convention. As of early October 2021, the premier is <a>Dominic Perrottet</a> of the <a>Liberal Party</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Constitution">Constitution</h3>
<p>
The form of the Government of New South Wales is prescribed in its Constitution, dating from 1856 and currently the <a>Constitution Act 1902</a> (NSW).<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Since 1901 New South Wales has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the <a>Australian Constitution</a> regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth.

</p>
<p>
In 2006, the Constitution Amendment <a>Pledge of Loyalty Act 2006</a> No 6,<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> was enacted to amend the NSW Constitution Act 1902 to require Members of the New South Wales Parliament and its Ministers to take a pledge of loyalty to Australia and to the people of New South Wales instead of swearing allegiance to <a>Elizabeth II</a> her heirs and successors, and to revise the oaths taken by Executive Councillors. The Pledge of Loyalty Act was officially assented to by the Queen on 3 April 2006. The option to swear allegiance to the Queen was restored as an alternative option in June 2012.

</p>
<p>
Under the Australian Constitution, New South Wales ceded certain legislative and judicial powers to the Commonwealth, but retained independence in all other areas. The New South Wales Constitution says: "The Legislature shall, subject to the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, have power to make laws for the peace, welfare, and good government of New South Wales in all cases whatsoever".<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Parliament">Parliament</h3>
<p>
The first <a>"responsible"</a> self-government of New South Wales was formed on 6 June 1856 with <a>Sir Stuart Alexander Donaldson</a> appointed by Governor <a>Sir William Denison</a> as its first <a>Colonial Secretary</a> which in those days accounted also as the <a>Premier</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> The <a>Parliament of New South Wales</a> is composed of the Sovereign and two houses: the <a>Legislative Assembly</a> (lower house), and the <a>Legislative Council</a> (upper house). Elections are held every four years on the fourth Saturday of March, the <a>most recent</a> being on 23 March 2019. At each election one member is elected to the Legislative Assembly from each of 93 <a>electoral districts</a> and half of the 42 members of the Legislative Council are elected by a statewide electorate.

New South Wales is divided into 128 <a>local government areas</a>. There is also the <a>Unincorporated Far West Region</a> which is not part of any local government area, in the sparsely inhabited <a>Far West</a>, and <a>Lord Howe Island</a>, which is also <a>unincorporated</a> but self-governed by the Lord Howe Island Board.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<h3 id="Emergency_services">Emergency services</h3>
<p>
New South Wales is policed by the <a>New South Wales Police Force</a>, a <a>statutory authority</a>. Established in 1862, the New South Wales Police Force investigates Summary and Indictable offences throughout the State of New South Wales. The state has two fire services: the volunteer based <a>New South Wales Rural Fire Service</a>, which is responsible for the majority of the state, and the <a>Fire and Rescue NSW</a>, a government agency responsible for protecting urban areas. There is some overlap in due to suburbanisation. Ambulance services are provided through the <a>New South Wales Ambulance</a>. Rescue services (i.e. vertical, road crash, confinement) are a joint effort by all emergency services, with Ambulance Rescue, Police Rescue Squad and Fire Rescue Units contributing. Volunteer rescue organisations include Marine Rescue New South Wales, <a>State Emergency Service</a> (SES), Surf Life Saving New South Wales and <a>Volunteer Rescue Association</a> (VRA).<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
The NSW school system comprises a kindergarten to year 12 system with primary schooling up to year 6 and secondary schooling between years 7 and 12. Schooling is compulsory from before 6 years old until the age of 17 (unless Year 10 is completed earlier).<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> Between 1990 and 2010, schooling was only compulsory in NSW until age 15.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Primary and secondary schools include government and non-government schools. Government schools are further classified as comprehensive and <a>selective schools</a>. Non-government schools include Catholic schools, other denominational schools, and non-denominational independent schools.

</p>
<p>
Typically, a primary school provides education from kindergarten level to year 6. A secondary school, usually called a "high school", provides education from years 7 to 12. <a>Secondary colleges</a> are secondary schools which only cater for years 11 and 12.

</p>
<p>
The <a>NSW Education Standards Authority</a> classifies the 13 years of primary and secondary schooling into six stages, beginning with Early Stage 1 (Kindergarten) and ending with Stage 6 (years 11 and 12).<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup>

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_of_School_Achievement">Record of School Achievement</a></div>
<p>
A Record of School Achievement (RoSA) is awarded by the <a>NSW Education Standards Authority</a> to students who have completed at least Year 10 but leave school without completing the <a>Higher School Certificate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> The RoSA was introduced in 2012 to replace the former <a>School Certificate</a>.

<p>
The Higher School Certificate (HSC) is the usual Year 12 leaving certificate in NSW. Most students complete the HSC prior to entering the workforce or going on to study at university or <a>TAFE</a> (although the HSC itself can be completed at TAFE). The HSC must be completed for a student to get an <a>Australian Tertiary Admission Rank</a> (formerly <a>Universities Admission Index</a>), which determines the student's rank against fellow students who completed the Higher School Certificate.

Eleven universities primarily operate in New South Wales. Sydney is home to Australia's first university, the <a>University of Sydney</a> founded in 1850. Other universities include the <a>University of New South Wales</a>, <a>Macquarie University</a>, <a>University of Technology, Sydney</a> and <a>Western Sydney University</a>. The <a>Australian Catholic University</a> has two of its six campuses in Sydney, and the private <a>University of Notre Dame Australia</a> also operates a secondary campus in the city.

</p>
<p>
Outside Sydney, the leading universities are the <a>University of Newcastle</a> and the <a>University of Wollongong</a>. Armidale is home to the <a>University of New England</a>, and <a>Charles Sturt University</a>.  <a>Southern Cross University</a> has campuses spread across cities in the state's north coast.

</p>
<p>
The public universities are state government agencies, however they are largely regulated by the federal government, which also administers their public funding. Admission to NSW universities is arranged together with universities in the <a>Australian Capital Territory</a> by another government agency, the <a>Universities Admission Centre.</a>
</p>
<p>
Primarily vocational training is provided up the level of advanced diplomas is provided by the state government's ten <a>Technical and Further Education</a> (TAFE) institutes. These institutes run courses in more than130 campuses throughout the state.

Since the 1970s, New South Wales has undergone an increasingly rapid economic and social transformation.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Old industries such as steel and shipbuilding have largely disappeared; although agriculture remains important, its share of the state's income is smaller than ever before.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
New industries including information technology and financial services are largely centred in Sydney and have risen to take their place, with many companies having their Australian headquarters in <a>Sydney CBD</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In addition, the <a>Macquarie Park</a> area of Sydney has attracted the Australian <a>headquarters</a> of many information technology firms.

</p>
<p>
Coal and related products are the state's biggest export. Its value to the state's economy is over A$5 billion, accounting for about 19% of all exports from NSW.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Tourism has also become important, with Sydney as its centre, also stimulating growth on the North Coast, around Coffs Harbour and Byron Bay.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Tourism is worth over $25.1 billion to the New South Wales economy and employs 7.1% of the workforce.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup>
In 2007, then-Premier of New South Wales <a>Morris Iemma</a> established <a>Events New South Wales</a> to "market Sydney and NSW as a leading global events destination". In July 2011 Events NSW merged with three key state authorities including Tourism NSW to establish <a>Destination NSW</a> (DNSW).<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New South Wales had a Gross State Product in 2018–19 (equivalent to Gross Domestic Product) of $614.4 billion which equalled $76,361 per capita.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 9 October 2007 NSW announced plans to build a 1,000 <a>MW</a> bank of wind powered turbines. The output of these is anticipated to be able to power up to 400,000 homes. The cost of this project will be $1.8 billion for 500 turbines.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> On 28 August 2008 the New South Wales cabinet voted to privatise <a>electricity retail</a>, causing 1,500 electrical workers to strike after a large anti-privatisation campaign.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>

Agriculture is spread throughout the eastern two-thirds of New South Wales. Cattle, sheep and pigs are the predominant types of livestock produced in NSW and they have been present since their importation during the earliest days of European settlement. Economically the state is the most important state in Australia, with about one-third of the country's sheep, one-fifth of its cattle, and one-third of its small number of pigs.
New South Wales produces a large share of Australia's hay, fruit, <a>legumes</a>, <a>lucerne</a>, maize, nuts, wool, wheat, oats, <a>oilseeds</a> (about 51%), poultry, rice (about 99%),<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup> vegetables, fishing including oyster farming, and forestry including wood chips.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> Bananas and sugar are grown chiefly in the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed River areas.

<p>
Wools are produced on the <a>Northern Tablelands</a> as well as prime lambs and beef cattle. The cotton industry is centred in the Namoi Valley in northwestern New South Wales. On the central slopes there are many orchards, with the principal fruits grown being apples, cherries and pears. However, the fruit industry is threatened by the Queensland fruit fly (<a>Bactrocera tyroni</a>) which causes more than $28.5 million a year in damage to Australian crops, primarily in Queensland and northern New South Wales.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>
About 40,200 hectares of vineyards lie across the eastern region of the state, with excellent wines produced in the <a>Hunter Valley</a>, with the <a>Riverina</a> being the largest wine producer in New South Wales.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup> Australia's largest and most valuable <a>Thoroughbred</a> horse breeding area is centred on <a>Scone</a> in the Hunter Valley.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> The Hunter Valley is the home of the world-famous <a>Coolmore</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup><a>Darley</a>  and <a>Kia-Ora</a><a>Thoroughbred</a>  horse studs.

</p>
<p>
About half of Australia's timber production is in New South Wales. Large areas of the state are now being replanted with eucalyptus forests.

</p>
<p>
Under the Water Management Act 2000, updated <a>riparian water rights</a> were given to those within NSW with <a>livestock</a>. This change was named "The Domestic Stock Right" which gives "an owner or occupier of a landholding is entitled to take water from a river, estuary or lake which fronts their land or from an aquifer which is underlying their land for domestic consumption and stock watering without the need for an access licence."<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>

The majority of railways in New South Wales are currently operated by the state government. Some lines began as branch-lines of railways starting in other states. For instance, <a>Balranald</a> near the Victorian border was connected by a rail line coming up from Victoria and into New South Wales. Another line beginning in Adelaide crossed over the border and stopped at Broken Hill.

</p>
<p>
Railways management are conducted by <a>Sydney Trains</a> and <a>NSW TrainLink</a><sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup> which maintain rolling stock. Sydney Trains operates trains within Sydney while NSW TrainLink operates outside Sydney, intercity, country and interstate services.

</p>
<p>
Both Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink have their main terminus at Sydney's <a>Central station</a>. NSW TrainLink regional and long-distance services consist of <a>XPT</a> services to <a>Grafton</a>, <a>Casino</a>, <a>Brisbane</a>, <a>Melbourne</a> and <a>Dubbo</a>, as well as <a>Xplorer</a> services to <a>Canberra</a>, <a>Griffith</a>, <a>Broken Hill</a>, <a>Armidale</a> and <a>Moree</a>. NSW TrainLink intercity trains operate on the <a>Blue Mountains Line</a>, <a>Central Cost & Newcastle Line</a>, <a>South Coast Line</a>, <a>Southern Highlands Line</a> and <a>Hunter Line</a>.

New South Wales has more than 780 national parks and reserves covering more than 8% of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> These parks range from rainforests, waterfalls, rugged bush to marine wonderlands and outback deserts, including <a>World Heritage</a> sites.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Royal National Park</a> on the southern outskirts of Sydney became Australia's first National Park when proclaimed on 26 April 1879. Originally named The National Park until 1955, this park was the second National Park to be established in the world after <a>Yellowstone National Park</a> in the U.S. <a>Kosciuszko National Park</a> is the largest park in state encompassing New South Wales' alpine region.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The National Parks Association was formed in 1957 to create a system of national parks all over New South Wales which led to the formation of the <a>National Parks and Wildlife Service</a> in 1967.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> This government agency is responsible for developing and maintaining the parks and reserve system, and conserving natural and cultural heritage, in the state of New South Wales. These parks preserve special habitats, plants and wildlife, such as the <a>Wollemi National Park</a> where the <a>Wollemi Pine</a> grows and areas sacred to Australian Aboriginals such as <a>Mutawintji National Park</a> in western New South Wales.

Throughout Australian history, New South Wales sporting teams have been very successful in domestic competitions and provided numerous players for the Australian national teams.

</p>
<p>
The largest sporting competition in the state is the <a>National Rugby League</a>, which is based in Sydney and expanded from the <a>New South Wales Rugby League</a>. The state is represented by the <a>New South Wales Blues</a> in the <a>State of Origin series</a>. Sydney is the spiritual home of Australian <a>rugby league</a>, and the state and hosts 10 of the 16 <a>NRL</a> teams; eight of these are based in the Sydney metropolitan area, namely the <a>Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs</a>, <a>Cronulla Sharks</a>, <a>Manly Sea Eagles</a>, <a>Parramatta Eels</a>, <a>Penrith Panthers</a>, <a>South Sydney Rabbitohs</a>, <a>Sydney Roosters</a> and <a>Wests Tigers</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Australian rules football</a> has historically not been strong in New South Wales outside the <a>Riverina</a> region. However, the <a>Sydney Swans</a> relocated from <a>South Melbourne</a> in 1982 and their presence and success since the late 1990s has raised the profile of <a>Australian rules football</a>, especially after their AFL premiership in 2005. A second NSW AFL club, the <a>Greater Western Sydney Giants</a>, entered the competition in 2012.

</p>
<p>
The main summer sport is cricket and the <a>Sydney Cricket Ground</a> hosts the 'New Year' cricket <a>Test match</a> in January each year. The <a>NSW Blues</a> play in the <a>One-Day Cup</a> and <a>Sheffield Shield</a> competitions. <a>Sydney Sixers</a> and <a>Sydney Thunder</a> both play in the <a>Big Bash League</a>.
