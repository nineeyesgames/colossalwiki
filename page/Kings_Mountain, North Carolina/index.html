<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
Originally the settlement was called <b>White Plains</b>, but the city was incorporated on October 16, 1874, and the name was changed. It was decided that "Kings Mountain" would be a more appropriate name since the community was close to the site of the historic 1780 <a>Battle of Kings Mountain</a> in <a>York County, South Carolina</a>, a turning point in the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Battle of Kings Mountain was proclaimed as "the turning point of the American Revolution" by <a>Thomas Jefferson</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Liberty Mountain, a play performed at the local theater, recounts the events of the battle. The downtown area is home to the museum, police station, and the <a>Mauney Memorial Library</a>.

The <a>Central School Historic District</a>, <a>King Street Overhead Bridge</a>, <a>Margrace Mill Village Historic District</a>, <a>Jacob S.
