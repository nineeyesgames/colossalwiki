<b>Sark</b> (French: <i>Sercq</i>, <small>French pronunciation: ​</small><span><a>[sɛʁ]</a></span>; <a>Sercquiais</a>: <i><i>Sèr</i></i> or <i><i>Cerq</i></i>) is a part of the <a>Channel Islands</a> in the southwestern <a>English Channel</a>, off the coast of <a>Normandy</a>, <a>France</a>. It is a royal <a>fief</a>, which forms part of the <a>Bailiwick of Guernsey</a>, with its own set of laws based on <a>Norman law</a> and its own parliament. It has a population of about 500.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> Sark (including the nearby island of <a>Brecqhou</a>) has an area of 2.10 square miles (5.44 km<sup>2</sup>).<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><a>Little Sark</a>  is a peninsula joined by a natural but high and very narrow <a>isthmus</a> to the rest of Sark.

</p>
<p>
Sark is one of the few remaining places in the world where <a>cars are banned from roads</a> and only tractors and horse-drawn vehicles are allowed.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> In 2011, Sark was designated as a <a>Dark Sky Community</a> and the first Dark Sky Island in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>
Sark consists of two main parts, Greater Sark, located at about <span><a><span><span><span>49°25′N</span><span>2°22′W</span></span></span><span>﻿ / ﻿</span><span><span>49.417°N 2.367°W</span><span>﻿ / <span>49.417; -2.367</span></span></span></a></span>, and <a>Little Sark</a> to the south. They are connected by a narrow <a>isthmus</a> called La Coupée which is 300 feet (91 m) long and has a drop of 330 feet (100 m) on each side.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Protective <a>railings</a> were erected in 1900; before then, children would crawl across on their hands and knees to avoid being blown over the edge. A narrow concrete road covering the entirety of the isthmus was built in 1945 by German <a>prisoners of war</a> under the direction of the <a>Royal Engineers</a>. Due to its isolation, the inhabitants of Little Sark had their own distinct form of <a>Sercquiais</a>, the native <a>Norman dialect</a> of the island.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Sark_windmill_working.jpg/220px-Sark_windmill_working.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The highest point on Sark is 374 feet (114 m) <a>above sea level</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> A <a>windmill</a>, dated 1571, is found there, the sails of which were removed during World War II. This high point is named <i><a>Le Moulin</a></i>, after the windmill. The location is also the highest point in the Bailiwick of Guernsey. Little Sark had a number of mines accessing a source of <a>galena</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> At Port Gorey, the ruins of silver mines<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> may be seen. Off the south end of Little Sark are the Venus Pool and the Adonis Pool, both natural swimming pools whose waters are refreshed at high tide.

</p>
<p>
The whole island is extensively penetrated at sea level by natural cave formations that provide unique habitats for many marine creatures, notably sea anemones, some of which are only safely accessible at low tide.

</p>
<p>
Sark is made up mainly of <a>amphibolite</a> and <a>granite</a><a>gneiss</a>  rocks, intruded by igneous magma sheets called <a>quartz diorite</a>. Recent (1990–2000)<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> geological studies and rock age dating by geologists from <a>Oxford Brookes University</a> shows that the gneisses probably formed around 620–600 million years ago during the Late Pre-Cambrian Age <a>Cadomian Orogeny</a>. The quartz diorite sheets were intruded during this Cadomian deformation and metamorphic event.

</p>
<p>
All the Sark rocks (and those of the nearby Channel Islands of <a>Guernsey</a> and <a>Alderney</a>) formed during geological activity in the continental crust above an ancient <a>subduction</a> zone. This geological setting would have been analogous to the modern-day subduction zone of the Pacific Ocean plate colliding and subducting beneath the North and South American continental plate.

</p>
<p>
Sark also exercises jurisdiction over the island of <a>Brecqhou</a>, only a few hundred feet west of Greater Sark. It is a <a>private island</a>, but it has recently been opened to some visitors. Since 1993, Brecqhou has been owned by <a>David and Frederick Barclay</a>, the brothers and co-owners of <i><a>The Daily Telegraph</a></i> until David Barclay's death in 2021. The brothers contested Sark's control over the island. The candidates endorsed by their various business interests on the island failed to win any seats in the elections held in 2008<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> and 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>

<i>Sark</i> is probably first mentioned in the <a>Antonine Itinerary</a> (<i>Itinerarium Antonini Augusti</i>, part II : <i>itinerarium maritimum</i>) 3rd – 4th century AD together with the other main <a>Channel Islands</a> as <i>Sarnia</i>, <i>Caesarea</i>, <i>Barsa</i>, <i>Silia</i> and <i>Andium</i>, but it is unclear to which it refers. It has been suggested that <i>Silia</i> referred to <i>Sark</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><span>: 131–132 </span></sup> The earliest record to evoke possibly the name of <i>Sark</i> are the <i>Life of saint Samson</i> and the <i>Life of saint Magloire</i>, bishops of <a>Dol-de-Bretagne</a>. They spell it <i>Sargia</i>,<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> with the neighbouring island <i>Bissargia</i>,<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup><sup><span>: 41 </span></sup> all the other documents are from the 11th to the 12th century and the forms are : <i>Serc, Serch, Sercum, Serco</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><span>: 124 </span></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Etymology">Etymology</h3>
<p>
<a>Richard Coates</a> has suggested that in the absence of a <a>Proto-Indo-European</a> etymology it may be worthwhile looking for a <a>Proto-Semitic</a> source for the name.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> He proposes a comparison between the probable root of Sark, <i>*Sarg-</i>, and <a>Proto-Semitic</a><i>*śrq </i> "redden; rise (as of the sun); east", noting Sark's position as the easternmost island of the <a>Guernsey</a> group.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> His theory is based on the early medieval Latin records mentioning <i>Sargia</i>, but many Islands more or less close to Sark have a Latin name ending with <i>-gia</i>, such as <i>Angia</i> (Channel Island), <a>Oye-Plage</a> (<a>Pas-de-Calais</a>, <i>Ogia</i> 8th century) and <a>Île-d'Yeu</a> (<a>Vendée</a>, former <i>Augia</i>). Later records all mention <i>Serc-</i> and not <i>*Sark</i>, that seem to result from a later anglicising of the /er/ group (compare French <i>merveille</i> > English <i>marvel</i>; French <i>Clerc</i> / English <i>clerk</i>, <i>clark</i> cf. Clark). The traditional pronunciation of <i>Sark</i> in the native Norman language is <i>sèr</i><span>[sɛr]</span> , with regular fall of final <span>[k]</span> like <i>clerc</i> in French.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><span>: 124 </span></sup> Finally, no specialist ever identified any Proto-Semitic element in the French coastal toponymy, even on the French mediterranean side. <a>René Lepelley</a> suggests a Scandinavian etymology that would explain the regular and late records of the root <i>Serc-</i> in the documents, according to him, it could be Old Norse <i>serkr</i> "shirt".<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><span>: 124 </span></sup> He compares with the name given to an island or a mountain by Vikings sailing from <a>Norway</a> to <a>Greenland</a> : <i>Hvítserkr</i> cf. <a>Hvitserk</a>, maybe <a>Mount Forel</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><span>: 124 </span></sup> so <a>Old Saxon</a><i>*Serki</i>  or Old Norse <i>Serkr</i> > <i>Serc</i> could have been a descriptive <a>landmark</a> for Saxon or Scandinavian sailors. In addition <a>Norman toponymy</a> reveals a mixture of (Anglo-)Saxon and Old Norse (Old Danish) place name elements. The Old English form of <i>sark</i> "shirt" (related to Old Norse <i>serkr</i>) is precisely <i>serċ, syrċ</i> > Middle English <i>serk</i>, <i>serke</i>, <i>sark</i> (through the Anglian variant).

<h3 id="Early_history">Early history</h3>
<p>
In ancient times, Sark was almost certainly occupied by the <a>Unelli</a>, the <a>Gallic tribe</a> of the <a>Cotentin Peninsula</a>. These people were conquered by <a>Julius Caesar</a> of the <a>Roman Empire</a> about 56 BC in the <a>Gallic Wars</a>. About three decades later under <a>Augustus</a>, <a>Gallia Celtica</a> was subdivided into three parts, with this area a part of <a>Gallia Lugdunensis</a>, with its capital in <a>Lugdunum</a>, now <a>Lyon</a>. A later division was named <i>Lugdunensis secunda</i> (<i>Lyonnaise</i> 2nd). A Unelli town, now <a>Coutances</a>, <a>was named</a><i>Constantia</i>  in 298 by the Roman emperor <a>Constantius Chlorus</a>.

</p>
<p>
Around 430, the <a>bishopric of Coutances</a> (much later under the <a>archbishopric of Rouen</a>), was established in <a>Coutances</a>, having about the same limits as the <i>Lyonnaise</i> 2nd.

</p>
<p>
In 933, Sark was included in the <a>Duchy of Normandy</a>, based on the traditional boundaries of the <i>Lugdunensis secunda</i> and the <a>archbishopric of Rouen</a>. Following the <a>Norman conquest of England</a> in 1066, the island was united with the <a>Crown of England</a>. In the thirteenth century, the French <a>pirate</a><a>Eustace the Monk</a> , having served <a>King John</a>, used Sark as a base of operations.

</p>
<p>
During the <a>Middle Ages</a>, the island was populated by <a>monastic</a> communities. By the 16th century, however,  the island was uninhabited and used by pirates as a refuge and base. In 1565, <a>Helier de Carteret</a>, <a>Seigneur</a> of <a>St. Ouen</a> in <a>Jersey</a>, received <a>letters patent</a> from <a>Queen Elizabeth I</a> granting him Sark as a <a>fief</a> in perpetuity on condition that he kept the island free of pirates and occupied by at least forty men who were of her <a>English subjects</a> or swore allegiance to the Crown.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> This he duly did, leasing 40 parcels of land (known as "Tenements") at a low rent to forty families, mostly from <a>St. Ouen</a>, on condition that a house be built and maintained on each parcel and that "the Tenant" provide one man, armed with a <a>musket</a>, for the defence of the island. The 40 tenements survive to this day, albeit with minor boundary changes. A subsequent attempt by the families to endow a <a>constitution</a> under a <a>bailiff</a>, as in Jersey, was stopped by the Guernsey authorities who resented any attempt to wrest Sark from their bailiwick.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
In 1844, desperate for funds to continue the operation of the silver mine on the island, the incumbent Seigneur, <a>Ernest le Pelley</a>, obtained <a>Crown permission</a> to mortgage Sark's <a>fief</a> to local <a>privateer</a> John Allaire. After the company running the mine went bankrupt, le Pelley was unable to keep up the <a>mortgage</a> payments and, in 1849, his son <a>Pierre Carey le Pelley</a>, the new Seigneur, was forced to sell the fief to <a>Marie Collings</a> for a total of £1,383<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> (£6,000 less the sum borrowed and an accumulated interest of £616 and 13s).<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During <a>World War II</a>, the island, along with the other Channel Islands, was <a>occupied by German forces</a> between 1940 and 1945. <a>German military rule on Sark</a> began on 4 July 1940, the day after the Guernsey <i><a>Kommandant</a></i> Major Albrecht Lanz and his interpreter and chief of staff Major Maas visited the island to inform the Dame and Seigneur (<a>Sibyl</a> and <a>Robert Hathaway</a>) of the new regime. <a>British Commandos</a> raided the island several times. <a>Operation Basalt</a>, during the night of 3–4 October 1942, captured a prisoner, and <a>Hardtack 7</a> was a failed British landing in December 1943. Sark was finally liberated on 10 May 1945, a full day after Guernsey.

</p>
<p>
In late August 1990, an unemployed French <a>nuclear physicist</a> named André Gardes, armed with a <a>semi-automatic weapon</a>, attempted an invasion of Sark. The night Gardes arrived, he put up two posters declaring his intention to take over the island the following day at noon. The following day he started a solo foot patrol in front of the manor, in battle-dress, weapon in hand. While Gardes was sitting on a bench waiting for noon to arrive, the island's volunteer <a><i>connétable</i></a> approached the Frenchman and complimented him on the quality of his weapon.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Gardes then proceeded to change the gun's magazine, at which point he was tackled to the ground, arrested, and given a seven-day sentence which he served in Guernsey.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> Gardes attempted a comeback the following year, but was intercepted in Guernsey.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
Billionaire brothers <a>David and Frederick Barclay</a> had purchased an island within Sark's territorial waters in 1993<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> along with the hotels on the island.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> In the mid-1990s, the brothers petitioned the <a>European Court of Human Rights</a> in <a>Strasbourg</a>, France, challenging Sark's inheritance law, which mandated their island be left to David's oldest son. The brothers wanted to will their estate equally to their four children.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> In 1999, women in Sark were given equal rights of property inheritance, mainly due to the brothers' influence.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until 2008, Sark's parliament (Chief Pleas) was a single chamber consisting of 54 members, comprising the Seigneur, the Seneschal, 40 owners of the tenements and 12 elected deputies. A change to the system was advocated largely by the <a>Barclay brothers</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Their premise was that a change was necessary to comply with the <a>European Convention on Human Rights</a>, though it was suggested that their objection was more likely at odds with certain property tax requirements and primogeniture laws affecting their holdings.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The old system was described as <a>feudal</a> and undemocratic because the tenants were entitled to sit in Chief Pleas as of right.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 16 January 2008 and 21 February 2008, the Chief Pleas approved a law to reform Chief Pleas as a 30-member chamber, with 28 members elected in island-wide elections, one hereditary member (the Seigneur) and one member (the Seneschal) appointed for life.<sup><a href="#ref_b">[b]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> The <a>Privy Council of the United Kingdom</a> approved the Sark law reforms on 9 April 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> The first elections under the new law were held in December 2008 and the new chamber first convened in January 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Some Sark residents have complained that the new system is not democratic and have described the powers the new law granted to the Seneschal, an unelected member whose term the new law extended to the duration of his natural life, as imperial or dictatorial. The <a>Court of Appeal</a> had ruled his powers to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> and his powers were subject to further legal challenges on these grounds.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2012 the BBC <i><a>Today</a></i> programme reported on local disquiet about the influence on the island of David and Frederick Barclay, the billionaire brothers who own <i><a>The Daily Telegraph</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup><i><a>The New Yorker</a></i>  magazine further illustrated the ongoing and escalating tensions between the Barclays and some of the longer-term residents.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> In 2017 <i><a>Private Eye</a></i> also reported on the situation, following the Barclays' decision to close their vineyard and a number of hotels and shops they own on Sark.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In January 2011, the <a>International Dark-Sky Association</a> designated Sark as Europe's first Dark Sky Community<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> and the first Dark Sky Island in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> This designation recognises that Sark is sufficiently clear of <a>light pollution</a> to allow naked-eye <a>astronomy</a>. Although Sark was aided in its achievement by its location, its historic ban on cars and the fact that there is no public lighting, it was also necessary for local residents to make adjustments, such as re-siting lights, to cut the light pollution.

</p>
<p>
The designation was made in January 2011, following an audit by the IDA in 2010. The award is significant in that Sark is the first island community to have achieved this; other Dark-Sky Places have, up to now, been mainly uninhabited areas, and IDA chairman Martin Morgan-Taylor commended Sark residents for their effort.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> After the designation was granted, Sark Astronomy Society worked to secure funds for an astronomical observatory on the island. In October 2015 Sark's observatory was officially opened by <a>Marek Kukula</a>, public astronomer from the Royal Observatory Greenwich.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>

<p>
Sark was considered the last <a>feudal state</a> in Europe. Together with the other <a>Channel Islands</a>, it is the last remnant of the former <a>Duchy of Normandy</a> still belonging to <a>the Crown</a>. Sark belongs to the Crown in its own right and has an independent relationship with the Crown through the Lieutenant Governor in Guernsey.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> Formally, the Seigneur holds it as a <a>fief</a> from the Crown, <a>reenfeoffing</a> the landowners on the island with their respective parcels. The political consequences of this construction were abolished in recent years, particularly in the reform of the legislative body, Chief Pleas, which took place in 2008.

</p>
<p>
Although part of the <a>Bailiwick of Guernsey</a>, Sark is fiscally separate from the rest of the Bailiwick. Together with the islands of Alderney and Guernsey, Sark from time to time approves Bailiwick of Guernsey legislation, which, subject to the approval of all three legislatures, applies in the entire Bailiwick. Legislation cannot be made which applies on Sark without the approval of the Chief Pleas, although recently Chief Pleas has been delegating a number of ordinance-making powers to the States of Guernsey. Such powers are, however, in each case subject to dis-application, or repeal, by the Chief Pleas. By long standing custom, Sark's criminal law has been made by the States of Guernsey, and this custom was put on a statutory basis in Section 4 of the Reform (Sark) Law, 2008, by which Sark delegates criminal law making power to the States of Guernsey.

</p>
<p>
Sark has its own <a>United Nations Standard Country or Area Code for Statistical Use</a> (690). That code is used for statistical processing purposes by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Secretariat.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Sark has its own separate <a>ISO</a> issued <a>Country Code</a><code>CQ</code><sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>   even though it is part of the  <a>Bailiwick of Guernsey</a>. Previously it was represented by <a>Guernsey’s country code</a> (GG).

<p>
<a>Christopher Beaumont</a> is the current and twenty-third Seigneur of Sark, having inherited the Seigneurie in 2016.

</p>
<p>
Before the constitutional reforms of 2008 the Seigneur of Sark was the head of the government of the Isle of Sark (in the case of a woman the title was Dame). Many of the laws, particularly those related to inheritance and the rule of the Seigneur, had changed little since they were enacted in 1565 under Queen <a>Elizabeth I</a>. For example, the Seigneur or Dame had the sole right on the island to keep pigeons and was the only person allowed to keep an <a>unspayed</a> dog.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Seneschal">Seneschal</h3>
<p>
Until 2013 the <a>Seneschal</a> of Sark was the head of the Chief Pleas. From 1583 and 1675 judicial functions were exercised by five elected <a>jurats</a> and a juge, but since 1675 the Seneschal has also been the judge of the island.

</p>
<p>
The Seneschal was historically appointed by the Seigneur, but nowadays there is an Appointment Committee consisting of the Seigneur and two other members appointed by the Seigneur.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2010, following the decision of the English Court of Appeal, the Chief Pleas decided to split the dual role of the Seneschal.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> Thus, since  2013 the Chief Pleas has elected its own President, who presides in almost all cases. The Seneschal now presides in Chief Pleas only during the election of the President.

</p>
<p>

<p>
Pursuant to the royal <a>letters patent</a>, the Seigneur was to keep the island inhabited by at least 40 armed men.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Therefore, from his lands, 39 parcels or <a>tenements</a>, each sufficient for one family, were subdivided and granted to settlers, the <i>tenants</i>. Later, some of these parcels were dismembered, and parts of the Seigneurial land were sold, creating more parcels.

</p>
<p>
Originally each head of a parcel-holding family had the right to vote in Chief Pleas, but in 1604 this right was restricted to the 39 original tenements required by the letters patent, the so-called 'Quarantaine Tenements' (<a>French</a>: <i>quarantaine</i>: a group of forty). The newer parcels mostly did not have the obligation to bear arms. In 1611 the dismemberment of tenements was forbidden, but the order was not immediately followed.

</p>
<p>
In Sark, the word <i>tenant</i> is used (and often pronounced as in French) in the sense of <i>feudal landholder</i> rather than the common English meaning of <i>lessee</i>. Originally, the word referred to any landowner, but today it is mostly used for a holder of one of the <i>Quarantaine</i> Tenements.

<p>
Chief Pleas (<a>French</a>: <i>Chefs Plaids</i>; <a>Sercquiais</a>: <i><i>Cheurs Pliaids</i></i>) is the parliament of Sark. It consists of eighteen members (<i><i>conseillers</i></i>), elected for a period of office of four years. In addition, the Seigneur and a speaker (who is elected by the <i>conseillers</i>) are counted as members; but they have no right to vote. The periods of office are shifted, with the period of half the <i>conseillers</i> starting in the middle of the periods of the other half. Thus, every second year, nine <i>conseillers</i> are elected for the coming four years. The elections are held on the basis of a single multi-member Sark-wide constituency, with the nine candidates receiving most votes being elected. The <i><i><a>Prévôt</a></i></i>, the <i><i><a>Greffier</a></i></i> and the treasurer also attend but are not members; the treasurer may address Chief Pleas on matters of taxation and finance.

</p>
<p>
However, if there are not more willing candidates than the numbers of positions to fill (including any casual vacancies), then all candidates are declared elected, without any actual election necessary. This happened both in the <a>2014</a> and the <a>2016 elections</a> to the Chief Pleas.

</p>
<p>
Until 2008, the Chief Pleas consisted of the tenants, and twelve deputies of the people as the only representation of the majority, an office introduced in 1922. The Seigneur and the <a>Seneschal</a> (who presided) were also members of Chief Pleas.

</p>
<p>
Since 2000, Chief Pleas was working on its own reform, responding to internal and international pressures. On 8 March 2006 by a vote of 25–15 Chief Pleas voted for a new legislature of the Seigneur, the Seneschal, fourteen elected landowners and fourteen elected non-landowners.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> But it was made plain by the British <a>Lord Chancellor</a><a>Jack Straw</a>  that this option was not on the table.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Offered two options for reform involving an elected legislature, one fully elected, one with a number of seats reserved for elected tenants, 56% of the inhabitants expressed a preference for a totally elected legislature.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> Following the poll, Chief Pleas voted on 4 October 2006 to replace the twelve deputies and forty tenants in Chief Pleas by 28 <i><i>conseillers</i></i> elected by universal adult suffrage.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> This decision was suspended in January 2007 when it was pointed out to Chief Pleas that the 56% versus 44% majority achieved in the opinion poll did not achieve the 60% majority required for the constitutional change.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The decision was replaced by the proposal that Chief Pleas should consist of sixteen tenants and twelve <i><i>conseillers</i></i> both elected by universal adult suffrage from 2008 to 2012 and that a binding referendum should then decide whether this composition should be kept or replaced by 28 <i><i>conseillers</i></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> This proposal was rejected by the Privy Council and the 28 <i><i>conseiller</i></i> option was reinstated in February 2008 and accepted by Privy Council in April 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2003, Chief Pleas voted to vary the long-standing <a>ban</a> on divorce in the island by extending to the Royal Court of Guernsey power to grant divorces.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2017, due to a lack of candidates standing for elections, the number of <i>conseillers</i> was reduced from 28 to 18, with nine elected every two years.

</p>
<p>
Bailiwick of Guernsey laws and United Kingdom Acts of Parliament can (the latter as in the case of all the other Channel Islands) be extended to Sark. Normally the consent of Chief Pleas is obtained for this, but the Supreme Court ruled in <i>R v Secretary of State for Justice</i> [2014] UKSC 54 that it need not be.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> Sark does not make its own criminal laws;<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> the responsibility for making criminal law was assigned to the States of Guernsey by Section 4(3) of the <a>Reform (Sark) Law 2008</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>

<p>
The executive officers on the island are:

<h3 id="Clameur_de%20haro">Clameur de haro</h3>
<p>
Among the old laws of the Channel Islands is the old <a>Norman</a> custom of the <i><a>clameur de haro</a></i>. Using this legal device, a person can obtain immediate cessation of any action he considers to be an infringement of his rights. At the scene, he must, in front of witnesses, recite the <a>Lord's Prayer</a> in French and cry out <i>"Haro, Haro, Haro! À mon aide mon Prince, on me fait tort!"</i> (<i>"Haro, Haro, Haro! To my aid, my Prince! I am being wronged!"</i>). It should then be registered with the Greffe Office within 24 hours. All actions against the person must then cease until the matter is heard by the Court. The last <i>clameur</i> recorded on Sark was raised in June 1970 to prevent the construction of a garden wall.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Periodicals">Periodicals</h3>
<p>
Since 2009 a resident of Sark has operated a weekly online newspaper called <i>The Sark Newspaper</i> (earlier: <i>The Sark Newsletter</i>).<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> The publisher is a former longtime employee of the wealthy <a>Barclay brothers</a>, who own the small neighbouring island of <a>Brecqhou</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> The publication has compared the local government of Sark "to fascist Germany in the 1930s". In 2014 over 50 residents of Sark filed complaints with the police about accusations made by the paper.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Since 2011 a quarterly magazine called <i>Sark Life</i>, which promotes a positive view of the island and welcomes contributions, is published by the Sark-based publishing company <i>Small Island Publishing</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Sercquiais">Sercquiais</h2>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sercquiais">Sercquiais</a></div>
<p>
Sercquiais (<i>Sarkese</i>, or sometimes called <i>Sark-French</i>) is a dialect of the <a>Norman language</a> still spoken in 1998 by a few older inhabitants of the island.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> Its decline has been linked with the arrival of English-speaking miners in 1835, and increased tourism in more recent years.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Economy">Economy</h2>
<h3 id="Tourism">Tourism</h3>
<p>
Sark's economy depends primarily on tourism and financial services. Sark has no company registry and relies on <a>Guernsey's financial services commission</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Taxation">Taxation</h3>
<p>
Sark is fiscally autonomous from <a>Guernsey</a>, and consequently has control over how it raises taxes. There are no taxes on income, capital gains or inheritances. There is also no <a>VAT</a> charged on goods and services, but import duties (Impôts) are charged on some goods brought onto the island at around 70–75% of Guernsey rates. However, the island does levy a Personal Capital Tax, a Property Tax, a Poll Tax ("Landing Tax") on visitors coming to the island, and a Property Transfer Tax (PTT) on residential properties when they are sold.

</p>
<p>
The island has its own tax assessor (in 2016, this remained Simon de Carteret),<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> who collects the <a>Property Tax</a>, PTT, and the Personal Capital Tax (direct tax).<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> Currently, the Personal Capital Tax ranges from a minimum of £450, to a maximum of £9,000 or 0.39% per annum (whichever is the lower).<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> In 2014, there were 5 taxpayers who paid the maximum amount of £6,400 (PCT and Property Tax combined), and 6 who paid zero tax. Residents over the age of 69 do not pay the PCT. If a resident chooses not to declare the value of their personal assets, they can elect to pay a flat-rate under the <a>Forfait</a> method.

</p>
<p>
In 2006, Property Transfer Tax replaced the feudal <i>Treizième</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> This used to be calculated by dividing the purchase price of any of the 30 tenements or 40 freehold properties on Sark by 13. The proceeds from doing this were then paid directly to the <a>Seigneur</a>. When the Treizième was abolished, the <a>Chief Pleas</a> introduced an indexed-linked pension of £28,000 per year, payable to the Seigneur.

</p>
<p>
An individual is considered to be a resident for tax purposes if they have remained on the island for at least 90 days in any tax year.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Sark_Company%20Registry">Sark Company Registry</h3>
<p>
Sark  has no public company registry, and  no company law. In January 2017, a private organisation called the "Sark Company Registry" was set up. The project was initially opposed by  the Guernsey Financial Services Commission,<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> but that opposition ended with nothing, since no law could prohibit private registration of companies. None of managers of the private registry or any company registered by them was ever sanctioned.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
<p>
Sark generally follows the <a>education system of England</a> though this is not strictly adhered to.

</p>
<p>
Sark has one school, the Sark School, which takes residents from the ages of 4 to 15. School is divided into 4 classes. Class 1 takes children from the ages of 4 to 7 (reception to year 2), class 2 caters for 7- to 9-year-olds (year 3 to year 4), class 3 has 9- to 14-year-olds (year 5 to year 9) and the older children attend class 4 (years 10 and 11).<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> Pupils wishing to obtain a <a>GCSE</a> or A-level qualification often finish their education in Guernsey or in England. Since 2006, however, a limited number of GCSEs have been offered to pupils at Sark School.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>

The Isle of Sark Shipping Company operates small ferries from Sark to <a>St Peter Port</a>, Guernsey. The service takes 55 minutes for the 9 miles (14 km) crossing.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> A high-speed passenger ferry is operated in summer by the French company Manche Iles Express to <a>Saint Helier</a>, <a>Jersey</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> A 12-passenger boat, the <i>Lady Maris II</i>, operates regular services to <a>Alderney</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The island is a <a>car-free zone</a><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup> where the only vehicles allowed are <a>horse-drawn vehicles</a>, bicycles, <a>tractors</a>, and battery-powered buggies for elderly or disabled people. <a>Electric bicycles</a> were deregulated in the 2019 Midsummer <a>Chief Pleas</a> with the ordinance coming in to force on 4 July 2019.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> Passengers and goods arriving by ferry from Guernsey are transported from the wharf by tractor-pulled vehicles.

</p>
<p>
There is no airport on Sark, and flight over Sark below 2400 ft is prohibited by the <i>Air Navigation (Restriction of Flying) (Guernsey) Regulations 1985</i> (Guernsey 1985/21). The closest airports are <a>Guernsey Airport</a> and <a>Jersey Airport</a>. Sark lies directly in line of approach to the runway of Guernsey airport, however, and low-flying<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> aircraft regularly fly over the island.

<p>
In common with the other Channel Islands, Sark is attached to the <a>Anglican</a><a>diocese of Canterbury</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> Catholics depend on the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth</a> in England.

</p>
<p>
Sark has an <a>Anglican</a> church (St Peter's, built 1820) and a <a>Methodist</a><sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup> church. <a>John Wesley</a> first proposed a mission to Sark in 1787. Jean de Quetteville of Jersey subsequently began preaching there, initially in a cottage at Le Clos à Geon and then at various houses around Sark. Preachers from Guernsey visited regularly, and in 1796, land was donated by Jean Vaudin, leader of the Methodist community in Sark, for the construction of a chapel, which Jean de Quetteville dedicated in 1797.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> In the mid-1800s there was a small <a>Plymouth Brethren</a> assembly. Its most notable member was the classicist <a>William Kelly</a> (1821–1906). Kelly was then the tutor to the Seigneur's children.

</p>
<p>
Supported by the evidence of the names of the <i>tenements</i> of La Moinerie and La Moinerie de Haut, it is believed<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> that the Seigneurie was constructed on the site of the <a>monastery</a> of Saint <a>Magloire</a>. Magloire had been <a>Samson of Dol</a>'s successor as bishop of <a>Dol</a>, but retired and founded a monastery in Sark where he died in the late sixth century. According to the <i>vita</i> of Magloire, the monastery housed 62 <a>monks</a> and a school for the instruction of the sons of noble families from the <a>Cotentin</a>. Magloire's <a>relics</a> were venerated at the monastery until the mid-ninth century when <a>Viking</a> raids rendered Sark unsafe, and the monks departed for Jersey, taking the relics with them.

<h2 id="Law_enforcement">Law enforcement</h2>
<p>
Despite Sark having its own legislative assembly, Guernsey has sole responsibility for matters of criminal law under the Sark (Reform) Law 2008. For matters of extreme law enforcement the island calls upon the <a>States of Guernsey Police Service</a>. Sark has a small police station and jail, with two (rarely used) cells available.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> The island has several police officers permanently stationed on it, the constable (senior officer), the vingtenier (deputy constable), two assistant constables (former constables), two custody officers (special constables) and several special constables.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Sark also has access to police services in Guernsey through the designation of a member of the Guernsey Neighbourhood Policing Team as a dedicated point of contact for Sark constables.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>failed verification</span></a></i>]</sup>

A resident doctor provides healthcare on Sark, and is available to attend accidents and emergencies. The <b>Sark Ambulance Service</b> operates two tractor-drawn ambulances,<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> and is able to treat casualties and transport them to the harbour for transfer onto the Guernsey marine ambulance launch, <i>Flying Christine III</i>, operated by <a>Guernsey Ambulance and Rescue Service</a>. A small ambulance station houses the two ambulances.

</p>
<p>
Fire and rescue services are provided by an independent and volunteer service established in 1958. Originally named 'Sark Fire Brigade', it is now known as the <b>Sark Fire and Rescue Service</b>.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> The services operates two pump tenders and an all-purpose trailer; all three appliances are drawn by tractors owing to the ban on other motor vehicles on Sark. The original fire station was a large garage. Today the service operates from a large purpose-built fire station on La Chasse Marette.

</p>
<p>
Lifeboat services are provided by the <a>Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a> from the <a>Guernsey lifeboat station</a>, supported by the RNLI stations on Jersey and Alderney.

<a>Maurice Leblanc</a>'s novel <i>L'Île aux Trente Cercueils</i> (translated in English as <i>The Secret of Sarek</i>) features an island called Sarek, off the coast of Brittany, and bears obvious similarities to Sark. In the story, gentleman-thief <a>Arsène Lupin</a> rescues Véronique d'Hergemont from a local superstition requiring the death of thirty women to appease vengeful spirits.
