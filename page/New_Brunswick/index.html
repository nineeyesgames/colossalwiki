<p>
<b>New Brunswick</b> (<a>French</a>: <i>Nouveau-Brunswick</i>, <small>pronounced </small><span><a>[nuvo bʁœnswik]</a></span>, locally <small></small><span><a>[nuvo bʁɔnzwɪk]</a></span>) is one of the thirteen <a>provinces and territories</a> of <a>Canada</a>. It is one of the three <a>Maritime provinces</a> and one of the four <a>Atlantic provinces</a>. It is the only province with both French and English as its official languages.

</p>
<p>
New Brunswick is bordered by <a>Quebec</a> to the north, <a>Nova Scotia</a> to the east, the <a>Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a> to the northeast, the <a>Bay of Fundy</a> to the southeast, and the <a>U.S. state</a> of <a>Maine</a> to the west. New Brunswick is about 83% forested and its northern half is occupied by the <a>Appalachians</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The province's climate is <a>continental</a> with snowy winters and temperate summers.

</p>
<p>
New Brunswick has a surface area of 72,908 km<sup>2</sup> (28,150 sq mi) and 747,101 inhabitants (2016).<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas. New Brunswick's largest cities are <a>Moncton</a> and <a>Saint John</a>, while its capital is <a>Fredericton</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1969, New Brunswick passed the <a>Official Languages Act</a> which began recognizing French as an official language, along with English.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> New Brunswickers have the right to receive provincial government services in the official language of their choice.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> About <span><span>2</span>⁄<span>3</span></span> of the population are <a>anglophone</a> and <link></link><span><span>1</span>⁄<span>3</span></span> are <a>francophone</a>. New Brunswick is home to most of the cultural region of <a>Acadia</a> and most <a>Acadians</a>. New Brunswick's <a>variety</a> of French is called <a>Acadian French</a> and 7 regional accents can be found.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Brunswick was first inhabited by <a>First Nations</a> like the <a>Miꞌkmaq</a> and <a>Maliseet</a>. In 1604, <a>Acadia</a>, the first <a>New France</a><a>colony</a> , was founded with the creation of <a>Port-Royal</a>. For 150 years afterwards, Acadia changed hands a few times due to numerous conflicts between <a>France</a> and the <a>United Kingdom</a>. From 1755 to 1764, the <a>British</a> deported <a>Acadians</a> en masse, an event known as the <a>Great Upheaval</a>. This, along with the <a>Treaty of Paris</a>, solidified Acadia as <a>British property</a>. In 1784, following the arrival of many <a>loyalists</a> fleeing the <a>American Revolution</a>, the colony of New Brunswick was officially created, separating it from what is now <a>Nova Scotia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> In the early 1800s, New Brunswick prospered and the population grew rapidly. In 1867, New Brunswick decided to <a>confederate</a> with Nova Scotia and the <a>Province of Canada</a> (now <a>Quebec</a> and <a>Ontario</a>) to form <a>Canada</a>. After <a>Confederation</a>, shipbuilding and lumbering declined, and <a>protectionism</a> disrupted trade with <a>New England</a>.

</p>
<p>
From the mid-1900s onwards, New Brunswick was one of the poorest regions of Canada, a fact eventually mitigated by <a>transfer payments</a>. As of 2002, the provincial <a>GDP</a> was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> A powerful <a>corporate concentration</a> of large companies in New Brunswick, including most newspapers, are owned by the <a>Irving Group of Companies</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> The province's 2019 output was CA$38.236 billion, which is 1.65% of Canada's <a>GDP</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Tourism accounts for 9% of the labour force either directly or indirectly. Popular destinations include the <a>Hopewell Rocks</a>, <a>Fundy National Park</a>, <a>Magnetic Hill</a>, <a>Kouchibouguac National Park</a> and <a>Roosevelt Campobello International Park</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>
After the founding in 1784, the colony was named New Brunswick in honour of <a>George III</a>, <a>King of Great Britain</a>, <a>King of Ireland</a>, and <a>prince-elector</a> of <a>Brunswick-Lüneburg</a> in what is now Germany.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Prior to European arrival, Indigenous tribes did not leave a written record, but their language is present in many placenames, such as <a>Aroostook</a>, <a>Bouctouche</a>, <a>Memramcook</a>, <a>Petitcodiac</a>, <a>Quispamsis</a>, <a>Richibucto</a> and <a>Shediac</a>.

<p>
<a>Indigenous peoples</a> have been in the area since about 7000 BC. At the time of European contact, inhabitants were the <a>Mi'kmaq</a>, the <a>Maliseet</a>, and the <a>Passamaquoddy</a>. 

</p>
<h3 id="European_settlements">European settlements</h3>
<p>
The first documented European visits were by <a>Jacques Cartier</a> in 1534. In 1604, a party including <a>Samuel de Champlain</a> visited the mouth of the <a>Saint John River</a> on the eponymous <a>Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day</a>. Now <a>Saint John</a>, this was later the site of the first permanent European settlement in New Brunswick.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> French settlement eventually extended up the river to the site of present-day <a>Fredericton</a>. Other settlements in the southeast extended from <a>Beaubassin</a>, near the present-day border with Nova Scotia, to <a>Baie Verte</a>, and up the <a>Petitcodiac</a>, <a>Memramcook</a>, and <a>Shepody</a> Rivers.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/FortBeausejour1750McCordMuseum.jpg/220px-FortBeausejour1750McCordMuseum.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
By the early 1700s, the French settlements formed a part of <a>Acadia</a>, a colonial division of <a>New France</a>. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the <a>Queen Anne's War</a>, and was formalized in the <a>Treaty of Utrecht of 1713</a>. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to Île Saint-Jean (<a>Prince Edward Island</a>) and <a>Île-Royale</a> (<a>Cape Breton Island</a>). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the <a>Isthmus of Chignecto</a>. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built <a>Fort Beauséjour</a> at the isthmus in 1751.

</p>
<p>
From 1749 to 1755, the British <a>engaged in a campaign to consolidate</a> its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an <a>Acadian Exodus</a> to French-controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British <a>captured Fort Beauséjour</a>, severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and Île-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to <a>expel the Acadians</a> in the initial periods of the <a>Seven Years' War</a>.

</p>
<p>
Continental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of <a>New France</a> being surrendered to the British with the <a>Treaty of Paris</a> in 1763. Acadians that returned from exile discovered several thousand immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands. Some settled around Memramcook and along the Saint John River.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> In 1766, settlers from Pennsylvania founded Moncton, and English settlers from Yorkshire arrived in the Sackville area. However, settlement of the area remained slow in the mid-18th century.

<p>
After the American Revolution, about 10,000 <a>loyalist</a> refugees settled along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy,<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> commemorated in the province's motto, <i>Spem reduxit</i> ("hope restored"). The number reached almost 14,000 by 1784, with about one in ten eventually returning to America.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> New Brunswick was founded in 1784 upon the partition of Nova Scotia into two areas which became the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> In the same year, New Brunswick formed its first elected assembly.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> In 1785, Saint John became Canada's first incorporated city.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> The population of the colony reached 26,000 in 1806 and 35,000 in 1812.

</p>
<p>
The 1800s saw an age of prosperity based on wood export and shipbuilding,<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> which was bolstered by the <a>Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty</a> of 1854 and demand from the <a>American Civil War</a>. <a>St. Martins</a> became the third most productive shipbuilding town in the Maritimes and produced over 500 vessels.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> In 1848, responsible home government was granted,<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> and the 1850s saw the emergence of political parties largely organised along religious and ethnic lines.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> The first half of the 1800s saw large-scale immigration from Ireland and Scotland, with the population reaching 252,047 by 1861.

</p>
<p>
The notion of unifying the separate colonies of <a>British North America</a> was discussed increasingly in the 1860s. Many felt the American Civil War to be the result of weak central government and wished to avoid such violence and chaos.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The 1864 <a>Charlottetown Conference</a> was intended to discuss a <a>Maritime Union</a>, but concerns over possible conquest by the Americans, coupled with a belief that Britain was unwilling to defend its colonies against an American attack, led to a request from the <a>Province of Canada</a> (now Ontario and Quebec) to expand the meeting's scope. In 1866 the United States cancelled the Reciprocity Treaty, leading to loss of trade with New England and prompting a desire to build trade within British North America,<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> and <a>Fenian raids</a> increased support for union.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> On 1 July 1867, New Brunswick entered the <a>Canadian Confederation</a> along with Nova Scotia and the <a>Province of Canada</a>.

<p>
Confederation brought into existence the <a>Intercolonial Railway</a> in 1872, a consolidation of the existing <a>Nova Scotia Railway</a>, <a>European and North American Railway</a>, and <a>Grand Trunk Railway</a>. In 1879 <a>John A. Macdonald</a>'s <a>Conservatives</a> enacted the <a>National Policy</a> which called for high tariffs and opposed <a>free trade</a>, disrupting the trading relationship between the Maritimes and <a>New England</a>. The economic situation was worsened by the decline of the wooden ship building industry. The railways and tariffs did foster the growth of new industries in the province such as textile manufacturing, iron mills, and sugar refineries,<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> many of which eventually failed to compete with better capitalized industry in central Canada.

</p>
<p>
In 1937 New Brunswick had the highest infant mortality and illiteracy rates in Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> At the end of the <a>Great Depression</a> the New Brunswick standard of living was much below the Canadian average. In 1940 the <a>Rowell–Sirois Commission</a> reported that the federal government attempts to manage the depression illustrated grave flaws in the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had many expenditure responsibilities such as healthcare, education, and welfare, which were becoming increasingly expensive. The Commission recommended the creation of equalization payments, implemented in 1957.

</p>
<p>
After Canada joined <a>World War II</a>, 14 NB army units were organized, in addition to <a>The Royal New Brunswick Regiment</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> and first deployed in the <a>Italian campaign</a> in 1943. After the <a>Normandy landings</a> they redeployed to northwestern Europe, along with <a>The North Shore Regiment</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> The <a>British Commonwealth Air Training Plan</a>, a training program for ally pilots, established bases in Moncton, <a>Chatham</a>, and <a>Pennfield Ridge</a>, as well as a military typing school in Saint John. While relatively unindustrialized before the war, New Brunswick became home to 34 plants on military contracts from which the province received over $78 million.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup><a>Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> , who had promised no conscription, asked the provinces if they would release the government of said promise. New Brunswick voted 69.1% yes. The policy was not implemented until 1944, too late for many of the conscripts to be deployed.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> There were 1808 NB fatalities among the armed forces.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>

<p>
The Acadians in northern New Brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous English speakers to the south. The population of French origin grew dramatically after Confederation, from about 16 per cent in 1871 to 34 per cent in 1931.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> Government services were often not available in French, and the infrastructure in Francophone areas was less developed than elsewhere. In 1960 Premier <a>Louis Robichaud</a> embarked on the <a>New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program</a>, in which education, rural road maintenance, and healthcare fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province, rather than the former county-based system. In 1969 the Robichaud government adopted the Official Languages Act making the province officially bilingual and establishing the right of New Brunswickers to obtain provincial government services in the official language of their choice. In 1982 at the request of the government of <a>Richard Hatfield</a>, this right became part of the <i><a>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a></i> and therefore part of the <a>Constitution of Canada</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>flag of New Brunswick</a>, based on the coat of arms, was adopted in 1965. The conventional heraldic representations of a lion and a ship represent colonial ties with Europe, and the importance of shipping at the time the coat of arms was assigned.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>
Roughly square, New Brunswick is bordered on the north by Quebec, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Bay of Fundy, and on the west by the US state of Maine. The southeast corner of the province is connected to Nova Scotia at the isthmus of Chignecto.

</p>
<p>
Glaciation has left much of New Brunswick's uplands with only shallow, acidic soils which have discouraged settlement but which are home to enormous forests.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<p>
New Brunswick's climate is more severe than that of the other Maritime provinces, which are lower and have more shoreline along the moderating sea. New Brunswick has a <a>humid continental climate</a>, with slightly milder winters on the Gulf of St. Lawrence coastline. Elevated parts of the far north of the province have a <a>subarctic climate</a>.

</p>
<p>
Evidence of <a>climate change</a> in New Brunswick can be seen in its more intense precipitation events, more frequent winter <a>thaws</a>, and one quarter to half the amount of <a>snowpack</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Today the <a>sea level</a> is about 30 cm (1 ft) higher than it was 100 years ago, and it is expected to rise twice that much again by the year 2100.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>

<p>
Most of New Brunswick<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> is forested with <a>secondary forest</a> or tertiary forest. At the start of European settlement, the Maritimes were covered from coast to coast by a forest of mature trees, giants by today's standards. Today less than one per cent of old-growth <a>Acadian forest</a> remains,<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> and the <a>World Wide Fund for Nature</a> lists the Acadian Forest as endangered.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Following the frequent large scale disturbances caused by settlement and timber harvesting, the Acadian forest is not growing back as it was, but is subject to borealization. This means that exposure-resistant species that are well adapted to the frequent large-scale disturbances common in the boreal forest are increasingly abundant. These include <a>jack pine</a>, <a>balsam fir</a>, <a>black spruce</a>, <a>white birch</a>, and <a>poplar</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Forest ecosystems support large carnivores such as the <a>bobcat</a>, <a>Canada lynx</a>, and <a>black bear</a>, and the large herbivores <a>moose</a> and <a>white-tailed deer</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Fiddlehead greens</a> are harvested from the <a>Ostrich fern</a> which grows on riverbanks. <a>Furbish's lousewort</a>, a <a>perennial</a><a>herb</a><a>endemic</a>   to the shores of the upper Saint John River, is an <a>endangered species</a> threatened by habitat destruction, riverside development, forestry, littering and recreational use of the riverbank.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> Many <a>wetlands</a> are being disrupted by the highly invasive <a>Introduced species</a><a>purple loosestrife</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>

<p>
Bedrock types range from 1 billion to 200 million years old.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
Much of the bedrock in the west and north derives from ocean deposits in the <a>Ordovician</a> that were subject to <a>folding</a> and <a>igneous</a><a>intrusion</a>  and that were eventually covered with lava during the <a>Paleozoic</a>, peaking during the <a>Acadian orogeny</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the <a>Carboniferous</a> period, about 340 million years ago, New Brunswick was in the <a>Maritimes Basin</a>, a <a>sedimentary basin</a> near the equator. Sediments, brought by rivers from surrounding highlands, accumulated there; after being compressed, they produced the Albert <a>oil shales</a> of southern New Brunswick. Eventually, sea water from the <a>Panthalassic Ocean</a> invaded the basin, forming the Windsor Sea. Once this receded, <a>conglomerates</a>, <a>sandstones</a>, and <a>shales</a> accumulated. The <a>rust</a> colour of these was caused by the oxidation of iron in the beds between wet and dry periods.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> Such late Carboniferous rock formed the <a>Hopewell Rocks</a>, which have been shaped by the extreme <a>tidal range</a> of the Bay of Fundy.

</p>
<p>
In the early <a>Triassic</a>, as <a>Pangea</a> drifted north it was rent apart, forming the <a>rift valley</a> that is the Bay of Fundy. <a>Magma</a> pushed up through the cracks, forming <a>basalt</a> columns on <a>Grand Manan</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>

<p>
New Brunswick lies entirely within the <a>Appalachian Mountain range</a>. The <a>rivers of New Brunswick</a> drain into either the <a>Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a> to the east or the <a>Bay of Fundy</a> to the south. These watersheds include lands in Quebec and Maine.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
New Brunswick and the rest of the <a>Maritime Peninsula</a> was covered by thick layers of ice during the last glacial period (the <a>Wisconsinian glaciation</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> It cut <a>U-shaped valleys</a> in the Saint John and <a>Nepisiguit River</a> valleys and pushed <a>granite</a> boulders from the Miramichi highlands south and east, leaving them as <a>erratics</a> when the ice receded at the end of the <a>Wisconsin glaciation</a>, along with deposits such as the <a>eskers</a> between Woodstock and St George, which are today sources of sand and gravel.

The four <a>Atlantic Provinces</a> are Canada's least populated, with New Brunswick the <a>third-least populous</a> at 747,101 in 2016. The Atlantic provinces also have higher rural populations. New Brunswick was largely rural until 1951; since then, the rural-urban split has been roughly even.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> Population density in the Maritimes is above average among Canadian provinces, which reflects their small size and the fact that they do not possess large, unpopulated hinterlands, as do the other seven provinces and three territories.

According to the Canadian Constitution, both English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick,<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> making it the only officially bilingual province. Government and public services are available in both English and French.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
For education, English-language and French-language systems serve the two linguistic communities at all levels.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Anglophone New Brunswickers make up roughly two-thirds of the population, while about one-third are Francophone. Recently there has been growth in the numbers of people reporting themselves as bilingual, with 34% reporting that they speak both English and French. This reflects a trend across Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>

As of October 2017, seasonally adjusted employment is 73,400 for the goods-producing sector and 280,900 for the services-producing sector.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> Those in the goods-producing industries are mostly employed in manufacturing or construction, while those in services work in social assistance, trades, and health care. A large portion of the economy is controlled by the <a>Irving Group of Companies</a>, which consists of the holdings of the family of <a>K. C. Irving</a>. The companies have significant holdings in <a>agriculture</a>, <a>forestry</a>, <a>food processing</a>, <a>freight transport</a> (including <a>railways</a> and trucking), media, <a>oil</a>, and <a>shipbuilding</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The United States is the province's largest export market, accounting for 92% of a foreign trade valued in 2014 at almost $13 billion, with refined petroleum making up 63% of that, followed by seafood products, pulp, paper and sawmill products and non-metallic minerals (chiefly potash). The value of exports, mostly to the United States, was $1.6 billion in 2016. About half of that came from lobster. Other products include salmon, crab, and herring.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> In 2015, spending on non-resident <a>tourism in New Brunswick</a> was $441 million, which provided $87 million in tax revenue.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Primary_sector">Primary sector</h3>
<p>
A large number of residents from New Brunswick are employed in the <a>primary sector of industry</a>. More than 13,000 New Brunswickers work in agriculture, shipping products worth over $1 billion, half of which is from crops, and half of that from potatoes, mostly in the Saint John River valley. <a>McCain Foods</a> is one of the world's largest manufacturers of frozen potato products. Other products include apples, <a>cranberries</a>, and <a>maple syrup</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> New Brunswick was in 2015 the biggest producer of wild <a>blueberries</a> in Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> The value of the livestock sector is about a quarter of a billion dollars, nearly half of which is dairy. Other sectors include poultry, fur, and goats, sheep, and pigs.

<p>
About 85 to 90% of New Brunswick is forested. Historically important, it accounted for more than 80% of exports in the mid-1800s. By the end of the 1800s the industry, and shipbuilding, were declining due to external economic factors. The 1920s saw the development of a pulp and paper industry. In the mid-1960s, forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> The industry employs nearly 12,000, generating revenues around $437 million.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Mining was historically unimportant in the province, but has grown since the 1950s.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> The province's GDP from the Mining and Quarrying industry in 2015 was $299.5 million.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup><a>Mines in New Brunswick</a>  produce lead, zinc, copper, and potash.

<p>
<a>Public education</a><a>elementary</a>  and <a>secondary education</a> in the province is administered by the provincial <a>Department of Education and Early Childhood Development</a>. New Brunswick has a parallel system of Anglophone and Francophone <a>public schools</a>. In the anglophone system, approximately 27 per cent of the students are enrolled in a <a>French immersion</a> programs.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The province also operates five public <a>post-secondary institutions</a>, including four public universities and one <a>college</a>. Four public universities operate campuses in New Brunswick, including the oldest English-language university in the country, the <a>University of New Brunswick</a>. Other English-language public universities include <a>Mount Allison University</a> and <a>St. Thomas University</a>. <a>Université de Moncton</a> is the province's only French-language university. All four universities offer <a>undergraduate</a>, and <a>postgraduate education</a>. Additionally, the Université de Moncton and the University of New Brunswick also provide <a>professional programs</a>.

</p>
<p>
Public colleges in the province are managed as a part of the <a>New Brunswick Community College</a> (NBCC) system, except for the <a>New Brunswick College of Craft & Design</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> which has operated through the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour since 1938. In addition to public institutions, the province is also home to several private <a>vocational schools</a>, such as the <a>Moncton Flight College</a>; and universities, the largest being <a>Crandall University</a>.

<p>
Under <a>Canadian federalism</a>, power is divided between federal and provincial governments. Among areas under federal jurisdiction are citizenship, foreign affairs, national defence, fisheries, criminal law, indigenous policies, and many others. Provincial jurisdiction covers public lands, health, education, and local government, among other things. Jurisdiction is shared for immigration, pensions, agriculture, and welfare.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The parliamentary system of government is modelled on the British <a>Westminster system</a>. Forty-nine representatives, nearly always members of <a>political parties</a>, are elected to the <a>Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick</a>. The <a>head of government</a> is the <a>Premier of New Brunswick</a>, normally the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the legislative assembly. Governance is handled by the <a>executive council</a> (<a>cabinet</a>), with about 32 ministries.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> Ceremonial duties of the <a>Monarchy in New Brunswick</a> are mostly carried out by the <a>Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick</a>.

</p>
<p>
Under amendments to the province's Legislative Assembly Act in 2007, a provincial election is held every four years. The two largest political parties are the <a>New Brunswick Liberal Association</a> and the <a>Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick</a>. Since the <a>2018 election</a>, minor parties are the <a>Green Party of New Brunswick</a> and the <a>People's Alliance of New Brunswick</a>.

<h3 id="Judiciary">Judiciary</h3>
<p>
The <a>Court of Appeal</a> of New Brunswick is the highest provincial court. It hears appeals from:

<ul><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Queen%27s_Bench_of_New_Brunswick">Court of Queen's Bench of New Brunswick</a>: has jurisdiction over family law and major criminal and civil cases and is divided accordingly into two divisions: Family and Trial.

<p>
Historically <a>the province was divided into counties</a> with elected governance, but this was abolished in 1966. While county governments have been abolished in New Brunswick, counties continue to be used as <a>census divisions</a> by <a>Statistics Canada</a>, and as an organizational unit, along with parishes, for registration of real-estate and its taxation. Counties continue to figure into the sense of identity of many New Brunwickers. Counties are further subdivided into <a>152 parishes</a>, which also lost their political significance in 1966 but are still used as <a>census subdivisions</a> by <a>Statistics Canada</a>.

</p>
<p>
Ninety-two per cent of the land in the province, inhabited by about 35% of the population, is under provincial administration and has no local, elected representation. The 51% of the province that is <a>Crown land</a> is administered by the <a>Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development</a>.

</p>
<p>
Most of the province is administrated as a <a>local service district (LSD)</a>, an unincorporated unit of local governance. As of 2017, there are 237 LSDs. Services, paid for by property taxes, include a variety of services such as fire protection, solid waste management, street lighting, and dog regulation. LSDs may elect advisory committees<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> and work with the <a>Department of Local Government</a> to recommend how to spend locally collected taxes.

</p>
<p>
In 2006 there were three rural communities. This is a relatively new type of entity; to be created, it requires a population of 3,000 and a tax base of $200 million.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> In 2006 there were 101 municipalities.

</p>
<p>
<a>Regional Service Commissions</a>, which number 12, were introduced in 2013 to regulate regional planning and solid waste disposal, and provide a forum for discussion on a regional level of police and emergency services, climate change adaptation planning, and regional sport, recreational and cultural facilities. The commissions' administrative councils are populated by the mayors of each municipality or rural community within a region.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Provincial_finances">Provincial finances</h3>
<p>
In 2015, New Brunswick had the most poorly-performing economy of any Canadian province, with a per capita income of $28,000.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> The government has historically run at a large deficit. With about half of the population being rural, it is expensive for the government to provide education and health services, which account for 60 per cent of government expenditure. Thirty-six per cent of the provincial budget is covered by federal cash transfers.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The government has frequently attempted to create employment through subsidies, which has often failed to generate long-term economic prosperity and has resulted in bad debt,<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> examples of which include <a>Bricklin</a>, Atcon,<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> and the Marriott call centre in Fredericton.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to a 2014 study by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, the large public debt is a very serious problem. Government revenues are shrinking because of a decline in federal transfer payments. Though expenditures are down (through government pension reform and a reduction in the number of public employees), they have increased relative to GDP,<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> necessitating further measures to reduce debt in the future.

</p>
<p>
In the 2014–15 <a>fiscal year</a>, provincial debt reached $12.2 billion or 37.7 per cent of nominal GDP, an increase over the $10.1 billion recorded in 2011–12.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> The <a>debt-to-GDP ratio</a> is projected to fall to 36.7% in 2019–20.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Rail">Rail</h3>
<p>
<a>Via Rail</a>'s <a>Ocean</a> service, which connects <a>Montreal</a> to <a>Halifax</a>, is currently the oldest continuously operated passenger route in North America, with stops from west to east at <a>Campbellton</a>, <a>Charlo</a>, <a>Jacquet River</a>, <a>Petit Rocher</a>, <a>Bathurst</a>, <a>Miramichi</a>, <a>Rogersville</a>, <a>Moncton</a>, and <a>Sackville</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Canadian National Railway</a> operates freight services along the same route, as well as a subdivision from Moncton to Saint John. The <a>New Brunswick Southern Railway</a>, a division of <a>J. D. Irving Limited</a>, together with its sister company <a>Eastern Maine Railway</a> form a continuous 305 km (190 mi) main line connecting Saint John and <a>Brownville Junction</a>, <a>Maine</a>.

New Brunswick is home to a number of individuals that work as musicians, in the performing arts, and/or the visual arts. <a>Music of New Brunswick</a> includes artists such as <a>Henry Burr</a>, <a>Roch Voisine</a>, <a>Lenny Breau</a>, and <a>Édith Butler</a>. <a>Symphony New Brunswick</a>, based in Saint John, tours extensively in the province. <a>Symphony New Brunswick</a> based in <a>Saint John</a> and the <a>Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada</a> (based in Moncton), tours nationally and internationally.

</p>
<p>
<a>Theatre New Brunswick</a> (based in Fredericton), tours plays around the province. Canadian playwright <a>Norm Foster</a> saw his early works premiere with Theatre New Brunswick. Other live theatre troops include the Théatre populaire d'Acadie in <a>Caraquet</a>, and <a>Live Bait Theatre</a> in Sackville. The refurbished <a>Imperial</a> and <a>Capitol</a> Theatres are found in Saint John and Moncton, respectively; the more modern <a>Playhouse</a> is in Fredericton.

<p>
Mount Allison University in Sackville began offering classes in 1854. The program came into its own under <a>John A. Hammond</a>, from 1893 to 1916. <a>Alex Colville</a> and <a>Lawren Harris</a> later studied and taught art there, and both <a>Christopher Pratt</a> and <a>Mary Pratt</a> were trained at Mount Allison. The university also opened an art gallery in 1895 and is named for its patron, John Owens of Saint John. The art gallery at Mount Allison University is presently the oldest <a>university-operated art gallery</a> in Canada. Modern New Brunswick artists include landscape painter <a>Jack Humphrey</a>, sculptor <a>Claude Roussel</a>, and <a>Miller Brittain</a>. The province is also home to the <a>Beaverbrook Art Gallery</a>, which was designated as the provincial art gallery in 1994.

New Brunswick has four daily newspapers: the <i><a>Times & Transcript</a></i>, serving eastern New Brunswick; the <i><a>Telegraph-Journal</a></i>, based in Saint John and distributed province-wide; <i><a>The Daily Gleaner</a></i>, based in Fredericton; and <i><a>L'Acadie Nouvelle</a></i>, based in Caraquet. The three English-language dailies and the majority of the weeklies are owned and operated by <a>Brunswick News</a>—which is privately owned by <a>James K. Irving</a>. Due to its dominant position, critics have accused Brunswick News of being biased towards the Irving Group of Companies, noting its reluctance to publish stories that are critical of the group.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
