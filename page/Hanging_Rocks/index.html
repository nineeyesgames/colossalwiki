Hanging Rocks is arranged in the form of three <a>anticlinal</a> arches, of which the most eastern spans 250, the second 550, and the third 220 yards in width.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> Hanging Rocks consists of anticlinal <a>stratified</a><a>sandstone</a>  and <a>limestone</a> layers.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The upper stratum of rocks is Monterey and Oriskany sandstone.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Immediately below the Monterey and <a>Oriskany (Ridgeley)</a> sandstone lies a layer of <a>cherty</a> limestone known as Lewiston chert-lentil which consists of a conglomeration of <a>brachiopods</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Atop Hanging Rocks is a level bench of land devoid of stone and containing fine rich <a>soil</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the western end of the Hanging Rocks formation lies an exposure of fine black to drab <a>shales</a> also containing small <a>concretions</a> and some <a>fossils</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> Contained in one of the shale layers are numerous specimens of <i><a>Phacops cristata</a></i> Hall.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> A volume of <i><a>The Journal of Geology</a></i> published by the <a>University of Chicago</a> in 1915 noted the following additional species collected in the layers of Hanging Rocks shale:<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>

<p>
The Hanging Rocks formation lies within a deep and narrow <a>gap</a> in <a>Mill Creek Mountain</a> formed by the South Branch Potomac River.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> The distance through the gap at Hanging Rocks is five-eighths of a mile.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The South Branch flowed in its present course as Mill Creek Mountain formed and slowly cut away at the mountain to expose Hanging Rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The gap at Hanging Rocks is one of four gaps in Mill Creek Mountain, the others being <a>Mechanicsburg Gap</a>, the Lower Hanging Rocks gap at <a>Blue Beach</a>, and the gap at the <a>North Branch Potomac River</a> to the west of its <a>confluence</a> with the South Branch to form the <a>Potomac River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Native_American%20presence">Native American presence</h3>
<p>
Hanging Rocks was originally the site of a Native American village, most likely either Delaware or <a>Seneca</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> As such, it served as the scene of a fierce battle between <a>Delaware</a> and <a>Catawba</a><a>Native Americans</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> A large party of Delawares had invaded the territory of the Catawbas, taken several prisoners, and commenced their retreat homewards.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The retreating Delawares halted at Hanging Rocks and commenced <a>fishing</a> in the South Branch.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The Catawbas, in close pursuit, discovered the Delawares and sent a party across the river to their rear and a party to their front, thus enclosing them.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> A bloody battle ensued resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Delaware.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> It is believed very few Delawares escaped the massacre.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>
At the time Samuel Kercheval's <i>A History of the Valley of Virginia</i> was written in 1833, a row of Indian graves, possibly belonging to the casualties of the aforementioned battle, existed between the public road and the perpendicular cliffs in the narrow margin of land along the South Branch.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The graves Kercheval cites may have been reinterments of the human bones unearthed during the construction of the <a>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> line along the base of Hanging Rocks in the 1880s.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Skeletons</a> of "gigantic size" were exhumed from a purported village and <a>burial site</a> on the farm of Mr. Herriott opposite the South Branch and below Hanging Rocks, providing further evidence of a Native American presence at Hanging Rocks gap.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> In addition to skeletons, numerous <a>fireplaces</a>, <a>iron</a><a>hatchets</a> , <a>glass</a><a>beads</a> , and <a>brass</a><a>ornaments</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Persons well-versed in the history of the region assert that the Native American peoples occupying this village were a branch of the Seneca.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> There were formerly many stone <a>mounds</a> along the foot of the hill to the rear of this village, however, all of them have now been removed.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Some of them were along the hillside a few feet above the margin of the level bottom; others were on the level but nowhere more than 50 or 60 feet (18 m) from the foot of the hill.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> The mounds varied in height from two to eight feet in diameter from 12 or 15 to 40 or 50 feet (15 m) and were composed entirely of stone.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> All except the smallest ones had a depression at the top as if they had contained a vault or pen of logs whose decay had allowed the rocks to settle.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Fragmentary bones were found in many of the mounds lying on the original surface.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Very few art relics were found at the mounds site.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> One contained a pipe with a wolf's head carved on it.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> A <a>cairn</a> on the hillside near the schoolhouse on the Herriott farm contained some decayed bones.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>
The area surrounding Hanging Rocks was settled by <a>European</a> settlers around the mid-18th century.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Trees had been cleared from the rocks before the arrival of settlers.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Early residents in its vicinity referred to Hanging Rocks as "Painted Rocks" because of the colorful figures and formations within its strata.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> The colors and figures, once thought to be Native American, were produced through geologic processes including the seepage of water through the rock.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> During the <a>French and Indian War</a>, two frontier <a>stockades</a> were constructed in close proximity to Hanging Rocks for the defense of the South Branch Valley: <a>Fort Williams</a> in 1754 two miles (3 km) to the north and <a>Fort Foreman</a> one mile (1.6 km) to the south.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Francis Asbury</a>, one of the first two bishops of the <a>Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, passed by Hanging Rocks during his travels in the South Branch Valley, which he described as a country of "mountains and natural curiosities."<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Asbury gave a description of Hanging Rocks in his <a>journal</a> on June 10, 1781:<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<div><blockquote><p>On my way to R. Williams' I had a view of a hanging rock that appears like a castle wall, about three hundred feet high, and looks as if it had been built with square slate stones; at first glance a traveller would be ready to fear it would fall on him.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup></p></blockquote></div>

<p>
The <a>Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike</a> (later known as the <a>North and South Branches Turnpike</a>) wagon road connecting <a>Romney</a> and <a>Cumberland</a>, <a>Maryland</a>, once occupied the narrow space between the South Branch and Hanging Rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The <a>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (currently the <a>South Branch Valley Railroad</a>) later shared the narrow space, which has varied between 40 feet (12 m) and 100 feet (30 m) in width, along with the pike after its completion to Romney from <a>Green Spring</a> in 1884.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> The pike later became <a>West Virginia Route 28</a> and was rerouted to the east of Mill Creek Mountain.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> The old Romney and Cumberland Pike span at the base of Hanging Rocks was reclassified as West Virginia Secondary Route 28/15 and is currently named Harriott-Wappocomo Road.

On June 19, 1861, Captain John Q. Winfield wrote from his encampment at Hanging Rocks:<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<div><blockquote><p>I am much pleased with our present location, which is in the midst of wealthy and hospitable people. The Inskips, Washingtons, and Parsons live around here in this valley. I am at the present writing from the home of Mrs. Inskip.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup></p></blockquote></div>
<p>
Captain Winfield's letter illustrated Hanging Rocks' proximity to some of Hampshire County's wealthiest families and their <a>plantations</a> including George William Washington and his son Robert M. Washington's <a>Ridgedale</a>, Colonel <a>Isaac Parsons</a>' <a>Wappocomo</a>, the Vance family's Ashbrook, and the Parsons and Inskeep families' The Rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> General <a>Turner Ashby</a> and his command occupied the Washington family's Ridgedale to the north of Hanging Rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A major <a>skirmish</a>, known as the Battle of Hanging Rocks Pass, took place at Hanging Rocks on Tuesday morning September 24, 1861.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The skirmish took place between the <a>Confederate</a> Hampshire Militia led by Colonel <a>Angus William McDonald</a> and several companies of <a>Union</a> troops under the command of Colonel Cantwell of the <a>82nd Ohio Infantry</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On the evening of September 23, 1861, Colonel McDonald received information that Union forces planned an attempt to pass through the gap at Hanging Rocks early the next morning.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Upon learning of this, McDonald and his 26 other men of the Hampshire Militia climbed to the top of Hanging Rocks in the early morning of September 24 in preparation for the arrival of Union troops.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> McDonald also sent a scouting party down the South Branch on the night of September 23.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Hanging Rocks was a strategic location during the American Civil War.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Troops traveling between Romney and points north, including Cumberland and Green Spring, naturally utilized the Romney and Cumberland Pike at the base of Hanging Rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> In addition, the shallow nature of the South Branch at Hanging Rocks created a <a>crossing</a> which allowed for a secondary connection of the Romney and Cumberland Pike to the <a>Northwestern Turnpike</a> at <a>Mechanicsburg</a> via Fox Hollow.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Upon taking to the summit, McDonald and his men piled <a>boulders</a> at the <a>precipice</a> of Hanging Rocks' cliffs to hurl at Union troops marching on the pike below.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The Confederates completed their preparations by daybreak.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> McDonald instructed his men to be careful not to mistake their returning scouting party for the advancing Union troops.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Shortly after daybreak, Union <a>cavalry</a> (a company of <a>Ringgold Cavalry</a>) crossed the ford on the South Branch at the north end of Hanging Rocks pass and its <a>columns</a> marched onto the pike below the awaiting Confederate militiamen.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Initially, the Confederates atop the rocks lay flat trying to ascertain through the <a>fog</a> whether the approaching cavalry was their returning scouting party.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The Union troops at the base of Hanging Rocks were naturally suspicious of the strategic location and were on high alert as they crossed the ford and made their way onto the pike.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The Union troops noticed heads of the Confederate militiamen peering over the cliffs and fired upon them.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The Confederates responded to the firing by hurling the boulders onto the road below causing the Union cavalry to hastily retreat down the pike and across the ford.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> In their hasty retreat, several of the Union cavalry ran over their <a>infantrymen</a> forcing them into the river, where at least five <a>drowned</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Sergeant</a> H. B. Hedge of the Ringgold Cavalry Company made the following record in his journal about the incident:<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<div><blockquote><p>On the morning of the 24th, we had our first fight of any real importance, at what is called the Hanging Rocks, eight miles from Romney. Just about daylight we crossed the river, encountered their pickets and drove them back; but to our surprise, their forces were on the rocks overhanging the road, and they opened a heavy fire on us. The Lieutenant Colonel in command of the column gave no orders whatever; all was confusion; we were afraid to go forward, and could not get back, as our teams had come across the river and blocked the narrow passage between the rocks and the stream.
</p><p>Fortunately for us, the enemy did not know we were so demoralized, and after a few volleys, retreated. Captain Keys kept cool, rallied his men, and after the enemy ceased firing, marched back over the river. Our loss was very slight, as the enemy fired over our heads. Our casualties were mostly in the river among some of the infantrymen, who in attempting to swim to the other shore, came into range of the enemy's fire.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup></p></blockquote></div>
<p>
The bodies of approximately a dozen Union soldiers were interred in the sand of the South Branch's western bank following the skirmish.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> High water the following Saturday September 28 washed additional bodies down the river which were also retrieved from the South Branch and buried.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Confederates were unaware, because of the earlier fog and the false report of a Union advance, that the Union troops were actually in retreat upon their arrival at Hanging Rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> The Confederates left Hanging  Rocks gap and pulled back to Romney.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
