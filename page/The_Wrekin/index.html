<b>The Wrekin</b><span><span><a>/<span><span>ˈ</span><span>r</span><span>iː</span><span>k</span><span>ɪ</span><span>n</span></span>/</a></span></span>  is a hill in east <a>Shropshire</a>, England. It is located some five miles (8 km) west of <a>Telford</a>, on the border between the unitary authorities of <a>Shropshire</a> and <a>Telford and Wrekin</a>. Rising above the Shropshire Plain to a height of 407 metres (1,335 feet) above sea level, it is a prominent and well-known landmark, signalling the entrance to Shropshire for travellers westbound on the <a>M54 motorway</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The Wrekin is contained within the northern <a>salient</a> of the <a>Shropshire Hills AONB</a>. The hill is popular with walkers and tourists and offers good views of Shropshire. It can be seen well into <a>Staffordshire</a> and the <a>Black Country</a>, and even as far as the <a>Beetham Tower</a> in Manchester, <a>Winter Hill</a> in Lancashire and <a>Cleeve Hill</a> in Gloucestershire.

The earliest mention of <i>the Wrekin</i> occurs in a charter of 855, as entered in a late 11th century <a>Worcester</a><a>cartulary</a> , spelled <i>Wreocensetun</i>. Its modern form is believed to have come into modern English by way of <a>Mercian</a>, and that is likely to have been taken from the early <a>Celtic</a><i>Wrikon-</i> .<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> The minor <a>Anglo-Saxon</a> kingdom of the <a>Wreocensæte</a> existed in the area before rule by <a>Mercia</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> For several centuries the hill was known as Mount Gilbert, a name given to it by the <a>Normans</a> after a <a>hermit</a> who lived there.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
There is an <a>Iron Age</a><a>hill fort</a>  on the summit almost 8 ha (20 acres) in size, to which the name <i>Uriconio</i> originally referred.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> It is thought the fort was built by the <a>Cornovii</a> tribe and was once their capital,<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> . In AD 47 Roman invaders stormed the fort and set fire to it, moving the defeated tribe on to <a>Wroxeter</a> (<a>Viroconium Cornoviorum</a>).

</p>
<p>
A more recent addition is <a>the Wrekin transmitting station</a>, used for broadcasting and telecommunications. At the top of the main mast is a <a>beacon</a> which emits a red pulse of light every few seconds at night. A beacon was originally erected on the Wrekin during the <a>Second World War</a> to warn aircraft, and was kept in operation until 1960. A new beacon was then installed in 2000, as part of a project to celebrate the new millennium. It is known locally as the "Wrekin Beacon", and is visible for many miles around.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Geology">Geology</h2>
<p>
The geology of the Wrekin and its immediate area is complex, consisting of a variety of rocks of a range of ages affected by numerous <a>faults</a>. The crest of the Wrekin's ridge and its northwestern slopes are formed from various rocks of <a>volcanic</a> origin assigned to the <a>Uriconian</a> series, of Precambrian age. The '<a>Uriconian</a> Volcanics' include <a>rhyolites</a>, <a>tuffs</a> and <a>agglomerates</a>. These rocks – layers of ancient lava flows laid down in a volcanic <a>island arc</a>, similar to modern Japan – are approximately 680 million years old.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Dolerite</a><a>dykes</a>  intruded the extrusive volcanic rocks around 563 million years ago. A variety of the <a>intrusive igneous rock</a><a>granophyre</a> , known as Ercallite forms the northeastern shoulder of the Ercall. It was put in place around 560 million years ago and is overlain by Cambrian rocks of sedimentary origin.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The southeastern side of the ridge is largely formed from <a>sandstones</a> and <a>shales</a> of <a>Cambrian</a> age. They include the early Cambrian Lower Comley Sandstone and Lower Comley Limestones together with the Wrekin Quartzite, outcrops of which also occur to the northwest of the ridge.

</p>
<p>
The lower ground to the northwest comprises sandstones and mudstones of late <a>Carboniferous</a> and <a>Permian</a> age whilst to the southeast are a succession of rocks of early Carboniferous age including <a>limestone</a>, the Little Wenlock Basalt and the Lydebrook Sandstone.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Structurally, the Wrekin together with <a>the Ercall</a> forms part of the Church Stretton Complex where different geological <a>terranes</a> meet. The <a>Cymru Terrane</a> is to the west with the <a>Wrekin Terrane</a> to the east of the fault system.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The fault system trends north-northeast:south-southwest and the line carries on through other geologically important exposures such as those in the area of <a>Caer Caradoc</a>.

</p>
<p>
Contrary to a common misconception, the Wrekin has never been a volcano in its own right, but is composed mainly of volcanic rocks and is a product of volcanism.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Its modern shape, which from certain viewpoints appears to resemble a volcano, has been formed by other natural processes.

</p>
<h2 id="Wider_area">Wider area</h2>
<p>
The name <i>the Wrekin</i> is also used to refer more generally to the part of East Shropshire around the towns of <a>Telford</a> and <a>Wellington</a>, within sight of the hill. The surrounding area is one of the birthplaces of industry: <a>Ironbridge Gorge</a> is just to the south of the Wrekin hill. Woodland covers much of the hill, the area around the hill and into the Ironbridge Gorge area too. The eponymous <a>Wrekin parliamentary constituency</a> incorporates the hill.

</p>
<h2 id="Access">Access</h2>
<p>
The Wrekin can be accessed from the final junction on the <a>M54 motorway</a> (J7) before it turns into the <a>A5</a> which continues to <a>Shrewsbury</a>. The hill is then signposted. There is a well-used footpath up the side of the hill which has an entrance at the end of the road off the M54. There is also a small car park and parking bays up the road. Between the Ercall and the Wrekin is a well positioned car park, at Forest Glen, allowing easy access to both areas. The ascent is steep in parts.

</p>
<h2 id="Folklore_and%20local%20custom">Folklore and local custom</h2>
<p>
The Wrekin is the subject of a well-known <a>legend</a> in Shropshire <a>folklore</a>. One version of the story runs as follows:<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
"All around the Wrekin", "Right 'round the Wrekin" or "Running round the Wrekin" is a phrase common in <a>Shropshire</a>, Worcestershire, <a>Staffordshire</a>, <a>Herefordshire</a>, the <a>Black Country</a>, <a>Birmingham</a> to mean "the long way round", in the same way that "round the houses" is used more widely.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> "To all friends around the Wrekin", meanwhile, is a <a>toast</a> traditionally used in Shropshire, especially at Christmas and New Year.

</p>
<p>
The amount of inclement weather in the area can also be said to be predicted by the visibility of the Wrekin. The saying being, "If you can see the Wrekin, it's going to rain. And if you can't see the Wrekin, it's already raining."<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Another well known local legend has it that you cannot be a true Salopian (person born in Shropshire) unless you have passed through the Needle's Eye - a split between two large rocks close to the summit.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1981, an event was undertaken by local school pupils and adults called "Hands around the Wrekin", whereby a large group of people all held hands, surrounding the hill at the base.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The Wrekin has a cheese named after it called Wrekin White, which is produced and sold in a dairy in <a>Newport, Shropshire</a>.

</p>
<p>
In September 2010, <a>Wiccans</a> conducted a <a>wicker man</a> burning ceremony at the Wrekin to celebrate the <a>autumnal equinox</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="In_popular%20culture">In popular culture</h2>
<p>
The Wrekin is mentioned in Poem XXXI of <a>A.E. Housman</a>'s collection <i><a>A Shropshire Lad</a></i>. The first <a>stanza</a> runs:

</p>
<div><p><span><i>On Wenlock Edge the wood's in trouble;</i></span><i><br></br></i><span><i>His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;</i></span><br></br><span><i>The gale, it plies the saplings double,</i></span><i><br></br></i><span><i>And thick on Severn snow the leaves.</i></span></p></div>
<p>
The Wrekin is also mentioned in <a>Half Man Half Biscuit</a>'s 1987 song, "<a>Rod Hull</a> Is Alive, Why?", with the line: "Halfway up the Wrekin with an empty flask of tea, a fog descends and takes away my visibility..."<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
In <a>Edward Lear</a>'s <i>A Book of Nonsense,</i> one of the limericks starts:<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<div><p><span><i>There was an Old Man of the Wrekin</i></span><i><br></br></i><span><i>Whose shoes made a horrible creaking</i></span></p></div>
<p>
In 2017, during an attempt by the high-street chain <a>Poundland</a> to challenge the trademark of <a>Mondelēz</a>'s <a>Toblerone</a> bar with their own Twin Peaks confectionery, they claimed that the latter was inspired by the shape of the Wrekin, which is situated close to Poundland's head office in <a>Willenhall</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> The chocolate bar was launched that year, and is said to be based on the Wrekin and <a>Ercall</a> hills. Poundland's founder, Steve Smith, lives near <a>Bridgnorth</a> in Shropshire.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the 1969 novel <i><a>A Pelican at Blandings</a></i>, The Wrekin can be seen from <a>P.G. Wodehouse</a>'s <a>Blandings Castle</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The Wrekin is a location in the 2020 videogame <i><a>Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a></i>, as "The Wroeken".<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
The most distant visible point is probably the <a>Forest of Bowland</a> in north-east Lancashire.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> Despite historical claims, including a toposcope at the summit, it is not possible to see <a>Snowdon</a> from the Wrekin, as the line of sight is blocked by <a>Cadair Berwyn</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
