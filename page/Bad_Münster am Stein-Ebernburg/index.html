<p>
<b>Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg</b> is a <a>spa town</a> of about 4,000 inhabitants (as of 2004) in the <a>Bad Kreuznach</a><a>district</a>  in <a>Rhineland-Palatinate</a>, <a>Germany</a>. Since 1 July 2014, it is part of the town <a>Bad Kreuznach</a>. It was the seat of the former <a>like-named <i>Verbandsgemeinde</i></a>, but not part of it. Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg was granted town rights on 29 April 1978<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> and is recognized as a <a>mineral spring</a><a>spa</a>  (<i>Mineralheilbad</i>) and a climatic spa (<i>heilklimatischer Kurort</i>). Today the "Spa" is famous for its clinics specializing in cardiological and orthopaedic rehabilitation. The many <a>graduation towers</a> form the largest open air inhalatorium in <a>Europe</a>.

Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg lies between 108 and 320 m above <a>sea level</a> at the foot of <a>Castle Ebernburg</a> in a region of low mountains with forests and <a>vineyards</a> framed by craggy massifs of the Rheingrafenstein and the Rotenfels and also by the river <a>Nahe</a>. The two rock formations in question, which lie across the river, are the highest north of the <a>Alps</a>, rising more than 200 m from the river bank. The town lies 6 km south of <a>Bad Kreuznach</a> and 50 km southwest of <a>Mainz</a>. The municipal area measures 9.53 km<sup>2</sup>. The greatest extent of <a>graduation towers</a> in Germany (roughly 1.4 km) stretches through the Salinental ("Saltworks Dale") from the neighbouring town of Bad Kreuznach to Bad Münster's spa zone.

<p>
Today's town of Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg was newly formed on 7 June 1969 within the framework of the administrative and territorial reform begun in Rhineland-Palatinate in the late 1960s from the hitherto self-administering municipalities of Bad Münster (2,261 inhabitants) and Ebernburg (1,671 inhabitants) under the name of the municipality of "Bad Münster-Ebernburg".<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> However, the new municipality only bore this name for a matter of months before it was changed to "Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg" on 1 November 1969. Town rights were granted on 29 April 1978.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
While Bad Münster belonged from the <a>Middle Ages</a> to the Knights of Löwenstein and the Rhinegraves, and after <a>Napoleon</a> was driven out, to <a>Prussia</a>’s <a>Rhine Province</a> (under the terms laid out by the <a>Congress of Vienna</a>) from 1815 to 1945, Ebernburg belonged throughout the Middle Ages to a whole succession of lords from the Counts of Saarbrücken to the <a>Counts of Leiningen</a>, the <a>Raugraves</a>, the <a>Counts of Sponheim</a>, the <a>Counts of Veldenz</a>, <a>Electoral Palatinate</a> and the <a>Lords of Sickingen</a> before the <a>Revolutionary</a>, later Napoleonic, <a>French</a> took over. After Napoleonic times, Ebernburg belonged (again, under the terms laid out by the Congress of Vienna) to the <a>Kingdom of Bavaria</a>, and after the <a>German Revolution</a> to the Free State of <a>Bavaria</a>, and was that state’s northernmost municipality, lying in Bavaria’s new <a>exclave</a> in the <a>Palatinate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> The two constituent communities’ separate histories may no longer live on politically, but they are still reflected in ecclesiastical administration, with Bad Münster belonging to the <a>Evangelical Church in the Rhineland</a> and the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier</a> and Ebernburg on the other hand belonging to the <a>Evangelical Church of the Palatinate</a> and the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer</a>.

<p>
About 1200, Münster had its first documentary mention. The village was founded below <a>Rheingrafenstein Castle</a>, built in 1050, which was the seat of the <a>Count Palatine of the Rhine</a>. The castle was destroyed in 1689 by the <a>French</a>, but the ruins remain. Until the 19th century it was a village with only a few houses around the old <a>Saint Martin's</a><a>Church</a>  (<i>St.-Martins-Kirche</i>). The people busied themselves with running saltworks, fishing on the <a>Nahe</a>, <a>farming</a> and for a time, <a>copper</a><a>mining</a>  in the Huttental (dale). In 1859, the <a>Nahe Valley Railway</a> (<a>Bingen</a>–<a>Saarbrücken</a>) was built, and in 1871 another <a>railway</a>, the <a>Alsenz Valley Railway</a> (<i>Alsenztalbahn</i>), which made it possible for the village's spa facilities, which had been established as far back as 1478, to experience a decisive upswing into a much visited spa centre, allowing the village to acquire the designation "Bad" (literally "bath") in 1905. The basis for all this is to this day the brine <a>springs</a> whose water contains <a>radon</a>. In the <a>Second World War</a>, the area around the railway bridge going towards the Salinental was partly destroyed in many <a>Allied</a><a>air raids</a> . Today, Bad Münster still has a railway link, lying as it does on the Bingen–<a>Kaiserslautern</a> and <a>Mainz</a>–Saarbrücken lines. In the post-war years, the centre has undergone a thorough change in appearance owing to the expansion of the spa infrastructure.

<p>
Ebernburg was from the <a>Middle Ages</a> an important village with a long tradition of <a>winegrowing</a> and <a>agriculture</a>. Its first documentary mention goes back to 1212 when the Counts of Saarbrücken donated the church at Ebernburg to the <a>Saint Cyriacus</a> Foundation near <a>Worms</a>. Both the village and the like-named <a>castle</a> originally lay elsewhere, although it is still unknown where this was, although perhaps it was around "Old Saint John the Baptist’s Church" (<i>Alte Johannes-Kirche</i>). In 1338, Raugrave Ruprecht and Count Johann of Sponheim-Kreuznach took it upon themselves to build the castle and the town on the site where they still stand today. It was then even envisaged to raise Ebernburg to town, but this did not come about. The old village core, the <i>Altdorf</i> ("Old Village"), which can still be made out as part of the centre's appearance even now, was for centuries ringed by a wall linked to <a>Castle Ebernburg</a>. The castle was eventually the residence of the famous German knight <a>Franz von Sickingen</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> After major expansion works at the castle beginning in 1482, the castle and the village itself were burnt down by princes who were allied against Franz von Sickingen in 1523. Reconstruction began under Franz's sons in 1542. As early as the beginning of the spa business in the late 19th century, Ebernburg underwent a quick expansion outside these walls, which is still not quite over. About the turn of the 20th century, therefore, the walls were torn down, and all that is left now is the foundation of one tower.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> Castle Ebernburg was partly destroyed during the <a>Second World War</a> but has been <a>reconstructed since (German Link)</a>. For the past 40 years it has been in use as an adult and youth <a>education centre (German Link)</a>.

<p>
The former council was made up of 20 council members, who were elected by <a>proportional representation</a> at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairwoman. It was incorporated into <a>Bad Kreuznach</a> on 1 July 2014.

<p>
The municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Voter turnout at the 2009 elections was 51.1%. Owing to the peculiarities in the <a>Rhineland-Palatinate</a> electoral system as it pertains to municipal elections (personalized proportional representation), the percentages given in the table above are presented as "weighted results", which can only reflect the voting relations arithmetically.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Coat_of%20arms">Coat of arms</h3>
<p>
The German blazon reads: <i>In Schwarz mit eingeschweifter silberner Spitze, darin ein wachsender konischer roter Rundturm mit vorkragendem vierzinnigem Kranz und zwei schwarzen Scharten, vorne fünf silberne Kugeln 2:1:2 gestellt, hinten ein steigender goldbekronter und rotbezungter silberner Löwe.</i>
</p>
<p>
The town's <a>arms</a> might in English <a>heraldic</a> language be described thus: Tierced in mantle dexter sable five roundles in saltire argent, sinister sable a lion rampant of the second crowned Or and langued gules, issuant from base argent a tower embattled gules with two arrowslits in pale of the first.

</p>
<p>
The <a>quincunx</a> and the tower were both <a>charges</a> found in Ebernburg's coat of arms before the 1969 amalgamation, the former being an heraldic device once borne by the Lords of Sickingen, who once held the local area, and the latter being a representation of the local <a>Castle Ebernburg</a>, which was also held by the Lords of Sickingen. The lion seems to have been drawn from Bad Münster's pre-amalgamation arms and was an heraldic device once borne by the Lords of Löwenstein ("Lion Stone"), who held Münster for several centuries. Both the current centres that make up Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg had their own arms before amalgamation. Ebernburg's arms had a "tierced in mantle" <a>division of the field</a> like the combined town's (that is, somewhat resembling a parted coat), but the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) and sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) sides were of different <a>tinctures</a>, with the sinister side in argent (silver). Furthermore, before this official coat of arms was granted in 1967, Ebernburg had borne an unofficial coat of arms with a gold field and the figure of <a>Saint Cyriacus</a>. Bad Münster's old arms featured a lion rampant in the same tinctures as the lion in the current arms, including the field tincture, but the lion held a fish in each paw, a <a>canting</a> charge for the Counts of Salm-Salm (<i>Salm</i> being one word in <a>German</a> for "<a>salmon</a>") who had descended from the Lords of Stein and held "Münster unter Rheingrafenstein" in the 14th century. The arms were also semé of five crosses crosslet (crosses whose ends are also crossed).<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>

Among the town's sights are the rock formations known as the Rotenfels and the Rheingrafenstein, the latter of which bears a crag which itself bears the <a>castle of the same name</a> right on the river <a>Nahe</a>. There is also another castle, the <a>Ebernburg</a>.

</p>
<p>
There is evidence that the <a>graduation towers</a> used for producing <a>salt</a> in Bad Münster am Stein already had their current form as far back as 1729. The weakly salty water from the salt spring is delivered to the graduation towers by pumps formerly driven by <a>waterwheels</a>, but now driven by <a>electricity</a>. From the top, the water trickles down in innumerable drops through walls of <a>blackthorn</a> to a collection basin, while the air in the area is enriched with salty material such as <a>iodine</a>, <a>bromine</a> and <a>strontium</a><a>ions</a>  as well as the <a>noble gas</a><a>radon</a> . By making the water into mist during its trickling through to the collection basin, the water's saltiness is raised. The waterwheels and part of the equipment (rods for transmitting the motion) can still be viewed.

</p>
<p>
The town's oldest secular building is the former <a>Electoral Palatinate</a><i>Unteramt</i>  at Burgstraße 13. Into the <a>lintel</a> of the <a>Renaissance</a> part, the year 1556 has been chiselled. Investigations of this part of the building have also brought to light that there are <a>mediaeval</a> wall remnants underneath the Renaissance walls.

</p>
<p>
Said to be Bad Münster's oldest property is the "Hahnenhof", first mentioned in 1560, a former Rhinegravial manor. The narrow so-called <i>Zehntscheune</i> ("<a>tithe barn</a>") with a <a>timber-frame</a> upper floor was in its time the financial office for <a>tithes</a> paid in kind.

</p>
<p>
The <i>Kurmittelhaus</i> (roughly "spa treatment house") in the <i>Kurpark</i> (spa park), built in 1911 in an <a>Art Nouveau</a> style with Nordic characteristics, is said to be one of the region's loveliest <a>timber-frame</a> buildings. It contains the spring hall with the two healing springs, the <i>Maximilianquelle</i> and the <i>Rheingrafenquelle</i>, which rise up through three glass pipes.

</p>
<h3 id="Museums">Museums</h3>
<p>
Housed in the former local history museum's rooms at the <i>Kurmittelhaus</i> is the <i>Naturstation Nahe</i> where in the warmer months animals from the region can be observed, in particular the <a>dice snake</a>, which is indigenous to the river <a>Nahe</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Regular_events">Regular events</h3>
<p>
Among special events in Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg are the "<a>mediaeval</a>" <i>Ebernburger Markt</i> (market) on the third weekend in September and the Christmas Market in the spa park.

Spa guests were in bygone decades an important source of income for Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg. After a few years in which the spa industry shrank greatly, the numbers of guests are now slowly rising once again. Most commercial enterprises in the town nowadays are <a>tourism</a> operations (lodging, <a>inns</a>) and <a>winegrowing</a> estates. There is moreover a cork wire factory where closure wire is made for <a>sekt</a> and <a>champagne</a> bottles.

<h3 id="Transport">Transport</h3>
<p>
Bad Münster am Stein-Ebernburg lies on the <a>Nahe Valley Railway</a> (<a>Bingen</a>–<a>Saarbrücken</a>).
