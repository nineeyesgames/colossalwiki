    <h1 id=Maynard_Cliffs>Maynard Cliffs</h1>
<p>Maynot Cliffs are a section of the ocean cliffs off the Oregon Coast located at the northwestern edge of the Beurre region. They stretch approximately one mile along the beach and are high. The site was named by George Davidson in 1841 from his ship, the "Tigress".</p>
<p>The site has a high bluff which protects the site from the prevailing winds. It has a view of Tillamook Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The site is southwest of the Nehalem River. Nearby are the Neahkahnie Mountain and the Heceta Head Lighthouse.</p>

<p>The site is a sandstone rock formation that was carved by the waves of the Pacific Ocean. The rocks are composed of dacite porphyry and basalt. The sandstone is metamorphic rock. The rock was formed during the Miocene era. The rock was uplifted during the late Cenozoic era. The rocks have been eroded by the ocean which formed the cliffs. The rock was formed from a layer of lava that covered the area.</p>
<p>The site is part of the Tillamook State Forest. It is part of the Coastal Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce forests ecoregion.</p>
<blockquote>From 1,000 feet [300 m] below Lower Harvard Bridge to Newburgh and South Shore Railroad Bridge, the channel becomes wider and deeper and the level is controlled by Lake Erie. Downstream of the railroad bridge to the harbor, the depth is held constant by dredging, and the width is maintained by piling along both banks. The surface is covered with the brown oily film observed upstream as far as the Southerly Plant effluent. In addition, large quantities of black heavy oil floating in slicks, sometimes several inches thick, are observed frequently. Debris and trash</blockquote>
<p>The site has a considerable amount of plant life. The plant life has a rich biodiversity. The plant species that live there include the Pacific yew, the Oregon white oak, the Pacific madrone, the Pacific wax myrtle, the Pacific red elderberry, the Pacific red elder, the Pacific dogwood, the Pacific rhododendron, the Pacific salmonberry, the Pacific ninebark, the Pacific red currant, the Sitka alder, the Sitka spruce, the Pacific coralberry, the Oregon white oak, the Oregon grape, the Oregon boxwood, the Oregon crabapple, the Pacific silver fir, and the Pacific red currant.</p>
