<b>Oregon</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˈ</span><span>ɒr</span></span>(<span><span>ɪ</span></span>)<span><span>ɡ</span><span>ən</span></span>/</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span></span>)<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> is a <a>state</a> in the <a>Pacific Northwest</a> region of the <a>Western United States</a>. The <a>Columbia River</a> delineates much of Oregon's northern boundary with <a>Washington</a>, while the <a>Snake River</a> delineates much of its eastern boundary with <a>Idaho</a>. The <a>42° north parallel</a> delineates the southern boundary with <a>California</a> and <a>Nevada</a>.

</p>
<p>
Oregon has been home to many <a>indigenous</a> nations for thousands of years. The first European traders, explorers, and settlers began exploring what is now Oregon's Pacific coast in the early-mid 16th century. As early as 1565, the <a>Spanish</a> began sending vessels northeast from the <a>Philippines</a>, riding the <a>Kuroshio Current</a> in a sweeping circular route across the northern part of the Pacific. In 1592, <a>Juan de Fuca</a> undertook detailed mapping and studies of ocean currents in the Pacific Northwest, including the Oregon coast as well as the <a>strait</a> now bearing his name. Spanish ships – 250 in as many years – would typically not land before reaching <a>Cape Mendocino</a> in California, but some landed or wrecked in what is now Oregon. <a>Nehalem</a> tales recount strangers and the discovery of items like chunks of <a>beeswax</a> and a lidded silver vase, likely connected to the 1707 wreck of the <i>San Francisco Xavier</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1843, an autonomous government was formed in the <a>Oregon Country</a>, and the <a>Oregon Territory</a> was created in 1848. Oregon became the 33rd state of the U.S. on February 14, 1859. Today, with 4 million people over 98,000 square miles (250,000 km<sup>2</sup>), Oregon is the <a>ninth largest</a> and <a>27th most populous</a> U.S. state. The capital, <a>Salem</a>, is the second-most populous city in Oregon, with 169,798 residents. <a>Portland</a>, with 647,805, ranks as the 26th among U.S. cities. The <a>Portland metropolitan area</a>, which also includes the city of <a>Vancouver, Washington</a>, to the north, ranks the 25th largest metro area in the nation, with a population of 2,453,168.

</p>
<p>
Oregon is one of the most geographically diverse states in the U.S.,<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> marked by volcanoes, abundant bodies of water, dense evergreen and mixed forests, as well as <a>high deserts</a> and semi-arid <a>shrublands</a>. At 11,249 feet (3,429 m), <a>Mount Hood</a>, a <a>stratovolcano</a>, is the state's highest point. Oregon's only national park, <a>Crater Lake National Park</a>, comprises the <a>caldera</a> surrounding <a>Crater Lake</a>, the deepest lake in the United States. The state is also home to the single <a>largest organism</a> in the world, <i><a>Armillaria ostoyae</a></i>, a fungus that runs beneath 2,200 acres (8.9 km<sup>2</sup>) of the <a>Malheur National Forest</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Because of its diverse landscapes and waterways, Oregon's economy is largely powered by various forms of agriculture, fishing, and <a>hydroelectric</a> power. Oregon is also the top <a>lumber</a> producer of the contiguous United States, with the lumber industry dominating the state's economy during the 20th century.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Technology is another one of Oregon's major economic forces, beginning in the 1970s with the establishment of the <a>Silicon Forest</a> and the expansion of <a>Tektronix</a> and <a>Intel</a>. Sportswear company <a>Nike, Inc.</a>, headquartered in <a>Beaverton</a>, is the state's largest public corporation with an annual revenue of $30.6 billion.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>
The earliest evidence of the name <i>Oregon</i> has <a>Spanish</a> origins. The term "orejón" (meaning "big ear") comes from the historical chronicle <i>Relación de la Alta y Baja California</i> (1598),<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> written by Rodrigo Montezuma of <a>New Spain</a>; it made reference to the <a>Columbia River</a> when the Spanish explorers penetrated into the North American territory that became part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. This chronicle is the first topographical and linguistic source with respect to the place name <i>Oregon</i>. There are also two other sources with Spanish origins, such as the word <i><a>oregano</a></i>, referring to a plant that grows in the southern part of the region. It is possible that the American territory was named by the Spaniards, as there is a stream in <a>Spain</a> called the "Arroyo del Oregón" (which is located in the province of <a>Ciudad Real</a>); it is also possible that the "j" in the Spanish phrase "El Orejón" was later corrupted into a "g",<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> and in context might refer to the 'earful' of the massive Columbia River at its mouth.

</p>
<p>
Another early use of the name, spelled <i>Ouragon</i>, was by Major <a>Robert Rogers</a> in a 1765 petition to the <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. The term referred to the then-mythical River of the West (the Columbia River). By 1778, the spelling had shifted to <i>Oregon</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> Rogers wrote:

</p>
<p>
One theory is that the name comes from the French word <i>ouragan</i> ("windstorm" or "hurricane"), which was applied to the River of the West based on Native American tales of powerful <a>Chinook winds</a> on the lower Columbia River, or perhaps from first-hand French experience with the Chinook winds of the <a>Great Plains</a>. At the time, the River of the West was thought to rise in western Minnesota and flow west through the Great Plains.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Joaquin Miller</a> wrote in <a><i>Sunset</i> magazine</a> in 1904:

</p>
<p>
Another account, endorsed as the "most plausible explanation" in the book <i><a>Oregon Geographic Names</a></i>, was advanced by <a>George R. Stewart</a> in a 1944 article in <i><a>American Speech</a></i>. According to Stewart, the name came from an engraver's error in a French map published in the early 18th century, on which the <a>Ouisiconsink (Wisconsin) River</a> was spelled "Ouaricon-sint", broken on two lines with the <i>-sint</i> below, so there appeared to be a river flowing to the west named "Ouaricon".

<p>
Humans have inhabited the area that is now Oregon for at least 15,000 years. In recorded history, mentions of the land date to as early as the 16th century. During the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers—and later the United States—quarreled over possession of the region until 1846, when the U.S. and Great Britain <a>finalized division</a> of the region. Oregon became a state on February 14, 1859, and as of 2015<sup><a>[update]</a></sup> has more than four million residents.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>

<p>
While there is considerable evidence that <a>Paleo-Indians</a> inhabited the region, the oldest evidence of habitation in Oregon was found at <a>Fort Rock Cave</a> and the <a>Paisley Caves</a> in <a>Lake County</a>. Archaeologist <a>Luther Cressman</a> dated material from Fort Rock to 13,200 years ago,<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> and there is evidence supporting inhabitants in the region at least 15,000 years ago.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> By 8000 BC there were settlements throughout the state, with populations concentrated along the lower Columbia River, in the western valleys, and around coastal estuaries.

</p>
<p>
During the <a>prehistoric period</a>, the Willamette Valley region was flooded after the collapse of glacial dams from then <a>Lake Missoula</a>, located in what would later become <a>Montana</a>. These massive floods occurred during the <a>last glacial period</a> and filled the valley with 300 to 400 feet (91 to 122 m) of water.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By the 16th century, Oregon was home to many Native American groups, including the <a>Chinook</a>, <a>Coquille</a> (<a>Ko-Kwell</a>), <a>Bannock</a>, <a>Chasta</a>, <a>Kalapuya</a>, <a>Klamath</a>, <a>Klickitat</a>, <a>Molalla</a>, <a>Nez Perce</a>, <a>Takelma</a>, <a>Killamuk</a>, <a>Neah-kah-nie</a>, <a>Umatilla</a>, and <a>Umpqua</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>

<p>
The first Europeans to visit Oregon were Spanish explorers led by <a>Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo</a>, who sighted southern Oregon off the Pacific coast in 1543.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> Sailing from Central America on the <i><a>Golden Hind</a></i> in 1579 in search of the <a>Strait of Anian</a> during <a>his circumnavigation of the Earth</a>, the English explorer and privateer Sir <a>Francis Drake</a> briefly anchored at <a>South Cove, Cape Arago</a>, just south of <a>Coos Bay</a>, before sailing for what is now California.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup><a>Martín de Aguilar</a> , continuing separately from <a>Sebastián Vizcaíno</a>'s scouting of California, reached as far north as <a>Cape Blanco</a> and possibly to Coos Bay in 1603.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Exploration continued routinely in 1774, starting with the expedition of the frigate <i>Santiago</i> by <a>Juan José Pérez Hernández</a>, and the coast of Oregon became a valuable trade route to Asia. In 1778, British captain <a>James Cook</a> also explored the coast.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>French Canadians</a>, <a>Scots</a>, <a>Métis</a> and other continental natives (e.g. <a>Iroquois</a>) trappers arrived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, soon to be followed by Catholic clergy. Some traveled as members of the <a>Lewis and Clark</a> and 1811 <a>Astor expedition</a>. Few stayed permanently such as Étienne Lussier, often referred to as the first "European" farmer in the state of Oregon. Evidence of the French Canadian presence can be found in numerous names of French origin such as <a>Malheur Lake</a>, <a>Malheur River</a>, <a>Grande Ronde</a>, <a>Deschutes</a> rivers and the city of <a>La Grande</a>. Furthermore, many of the early pioneers first came out West with the <a>North West Company</a> and the <a>Hudson's Bay Company</a> before heading South of the Columbia for better farmland as the fur trade declined. <a>French Prairie</a> by the <a>Willamette River</a> and <a>French Settlement</a> by the <a>Umpqua River</a> are known as early mixed ancestry settlements. 
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Franchere_fort_astoria_1813.jpg/220px-Franchere_fort_astoria_1813.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled through northern Oregon also in search of the <a>Northwest Passage</a>. They built their winter fort in 1805–06 at <a>Fort Clatsop</a>, near the mouth of the Columbia River, staying at the encampment from December until March.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
British explorer <a>David Thompson</a> also conducted overland exploration. In 1811, while working for the North West Company, Thompson became the first European to navigate the entire Columbia River.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Stopping on the way, at the junction of the Snake River, he posted a claim to the region for <a>Great Britain</a> and the North West Company. Upon returning to <a>Montreal</a>, he publicized the abundance of fur-bearing animals in the area.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Also in 1811, New Yorker <a>John Jacob Astor</a> financed the establishment of <a>Fort Astoria</a> at the mouth of the Columbia River as a western outpost to his <a>Pacific Fur Company</a>;<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> this was the first permanent European settlement in Oregon.

</p>
<p>
In the <a>War of 1812</a>, the <a>British</a> gained control of all Pacific Fur Company posts. The <a>Treaty of 1818</a> established joint British and American occupancy of the region west of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. By the 1820s and 1830s, the <a>Hudson's Bay Company</a> dominated the Pacific Northwest from its <a>Columbia District</a> headquarters at <a>Fort Vancouver</a> (built-in 1825 by the district's chief factor, <a>John McLoughlin</a>, across the Columbia from present-day <a>Portland</a>).

</p>
<p>
In 1841, the expert trapper and entrepreneur <a>Ewing Young</a> died leaving considerable wealth and no apparent heir, and no system to <a>probate</a> his estate. A meeting followed Young's funeral, at which a probate government was proposed.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> Doctor <a>Ira Babcock</a> of <a>Jason Lee</a>'s <a>Methodist Mission</a> was elected supreme judge.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> Babcock chaired two meetings in 1842 at <a>Champoeg</a>, (halfway between Lee's mission and <a>Oregon City</a>), to discuss <a>wolves</a> and other animals of contemporary concern. These meetings were precursors to an <a>all-citizen meeting</a> in 1843, which instituted a provisional government headed by an <a>executive committee</a> made up of <a>David Hill</a>, <a>Alanson Beers</a>, and <a>Joseph Gale</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> This government was the first acting public government of the <a>Oregon Country</a> before annexation by the government of the United States. It was succeeded by a Second Executive Committee, made up of <a>Peter G. Stewart</a>, <a>Osborne Russell</a>, and <a>William J. Bailey</a>, and this committee was itself succeeded by <a>George Abernethy</a>, who was the first and only Governor of Oregon under the provisional government.

</p>
<p>
Also in 1841, <a>Sir George Simpson</a>, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, reversed the Hudson's Bay Company's long-standing policy of discouraging settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> He directed that some 200 <a>Red River Colony</a> settlers be relocated to HBC farms near Fort Vancouver, (the <a>James Sinclair</a> expedition), in an attempt to hold Columbia District.

</p>
<p>
Starting in 1842–43, the <a>Oregon Trail</a> brought many new American settlers to the Oregon Country. <a>Oregon's boundaries were disputed</a> for a time, contributing to tensions between the U.K. and the U.S., but the border was defined peacefully in the 1846 <a>Oregon Treaty</a>. The border between the United States and <a>British North America</a> was set at the <a>49th parallel</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> The <a>Oregon Territory</a> was officially organized on August 13, 1848.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Settlement increased with the <a>Donation Land Claim Act</a> of 1850 and the <a>forced relocation</a> of the native population to <a>Indian reservations in Oregon</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Statehood">Statehood</h3>
<p>
In December 1844, Oregon passed its <a>Black Exclusion Law</a>, which prohibited African Americans from entering the territory while simultaneously prohibiting <a>slavery</a>. Slave owners who brought their slaves with them were given three years before they were forced to free them. Any African Americans in the region after the law was passed were forced to leave, and those who did not comply were arrested and beaten. They received no less than twenty and no more than thirty-nine stripes across their bareback if they still did not leave. This process could be repeated every six months.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> Slavery played a major part in Oregon's history and even influenced its path to statehood. The territory's request for <a>statehood</a> was delayed several times, as members of Congress argued among themselves whether the territory should be admitted as a "free" or "slave" state. Eventually politicians from the South agreed to allow Oregon to enter as a "free" state, in exchange for opening slavery to the southwest United States.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Oregon was admitted to the <a>Union</a> on February 14, 1859, though no one in Oregon knew it until March 15.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> Founded as a refuge from disputes over slavery, Oregon had a "whites only" clause in its original state Constitution.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> At the outbreak of the <a>American Civil War</a>, regular U.S. troops were withdrawn and sent east <a>to aid the Union</a>. Volunteer cavalry recruited in California were sent north to Oregon to keep peace and protect the populace. The <a>First Oregon Cavalry</a> served until June 1865.

<p>
Beginning in the 1880s, the growth of railroads expanded the state's <a>lumber</a>, <a>wheat</a>, and other agricultural markets, and the rapid growth of its cities.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> Due to the abundance of timber and waterway access via the <a>Willamette River</a>, Portland became a major force in the lumber industry of the <a>Pacific Northwest</a>, and quickly became the state's largest city. It would earn the nickname "Stumptown",<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> and would later become recognized as one of the most dangerous port cities in the United States due to racketeering and illegal activities at the turn of the 20th century.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> In 1902, Oregon introduced <a>direct legislation</a> by the state's citizens through <a>initiatives</a> and <a>referenda</a>, known as the <a>Oregon System</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On May 5, 1945, six civilians were killed by a <a>Japanese balloon bomb</a> that exploded on <a>Gearhart Mountain</a> near <a>Bly</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> They remained the only people on American soil whose deaths were attributed to an enemy balloon bomb explosion during <a>World War II</a>. The bombing site is now located in the <a>Mitchell Recreation Area</a>.

</p>
<p>
Industrial expansion began in earnest following the 1933–37 construction of the <a>Bonneville Dam</a> on the Columbia River. <a>Hydroelectric power</a>, food, and lumber provided by Oregon helped fuel the development of the West, although the periodic fluctuations in the U.S. building industry have hurt the state's economy on multiple occasions. Portland, in particular, experienced a population boom between 1900 and 1930, tripling in size; the arrival of World War II also provided the northwest region of the state with an industrial boom, where <a>Liberty ships</a> and aircraft carriers were constructed.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the 1970s, the Pacific Northwest was particularly affected by the <a>1973 oil crisis</a>, with Oregon suffering a substantial shortage.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1972, The Oregon Beverage Container Act of 1971,<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> popularly called the Bottle Bill, became the first law of its kind in the United States. The Bottle Bill system in Oregon was created to control litter. In practice, the system promotes recycling, not reusing, and the collected containers are generally destroyed and made into new containers. Ten states<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> currently have similar laws.

</p>
<p>
In 1994, Oregon became the first U.S. state to legalize <a>physician-assisted suicide</a> through the <a>Oregon Death with Dignity Act</a>. A measure to legalize recreational use of <a>marijuana</a> in Oregon was approved on November 4, 2014, making Oregon only the second state at the time to have legalized <a>gay marriage</a>, physician-assisted suicide, and recreational marijuana.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>

Oregon is 295 miles (475 km) north to south at longest distance, and 395 miles (636 km) east to west. With an area of 98,381 square miles (254,810 km<sup>2</sup>), Oregon is slightly larger than the <a>United Kingdom</a>. It is the ninth largest state in the United States.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> Oregon's highest point is the summit of <a>Mount Hood</a>, at 11,249 feet (3,429 m), and its lowest point is the sea level of the Pacific Ocean along the Oregon Coast.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> Oregon's mean elevation is 3,300 feet (1,006 m). <a>Crater Lake National Park</a>, the state's only national park, is the site of the deepest lake in the United States at 1,943 feet (592 m).<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> Oregon claims the <a>D River</a> as the shortest river in the world,<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> though the state of Montana makes the same claim of its <a>Roe River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> Oregon is also home to <a>Mill Ends Park</a> (in Portland),<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> the smallest park in the world at 452 square inches (0.29 m<sup>2</sup>).

</p>
<p>
Oregon is split into eight geographical regions. In <a>Western Oregon</a>: <a>Oregon Coast</a> (west of the <a>Coast Range</a>), the <a>Willamette Valley</a>, <a>Rogue Valley</a>, <a>Cascade Range</a> and <a>Klamath Mountains</a>; and in <a>Central</a> and <a>Eastern Oregon</a>: the <a>Columbia Plateau</a>, the <a>High Desert</a>, and the <a>Blue Mountains</a>.

</p>
<p>
Oregon lies in two <a>time zones</a>. Most of <a>Malheur County</a> is in the <a>Mountain Time Zone</a>, while the rest of the state lies in the <a>Pacific Time Zone</a>.

<p>
Western Oregon's mountainous regions, home to three of the <a>most prominent mountain peaks of the United States</a> including <a>Mount Hood</a>, were formed by the volcanic activity of the <a>Juan de Fuca Plate</a>, a <a>tectonic plate</a> that poses a continued threat of <a>volcanic</a> activity and earthquakes in the region. The most recent major activity was the <a>1700 Cascadia earthquake</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup><a>Washington</a> 's <a>Mount St. Helens</a><a>erupted in 1980</a> , an event visible from northern Oregon and affecting some areas there.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Columbia River, which forms much of Oregon's northern border, also played a major role in the region's geological evolution, as well as its economic and cultural development. The Columbia is one of North America's largest rivers, and one of two rivers to cut through the <a>Cascades</a> (the <a>Klamath River</a> in southern Oregon is the other). About 15,000 years ago, the Columbia repeatedly flooded much of Oregon during the <a>Missoula Floods</a>; the modern fertility of the Willamette Valley is largely the result. Plentiful <a>salmon</a> made parts of the river, such as <a>Celilo Falls</a>, hubs of economic activity for thousands of years.

</p>
<p>
Today, Oregon's landscape varies from <a>rain forest</a> in the Coast Range to barren desert in the southeast, which still meets the technical definition of a <a>frontier</a>. Oregon's <a>geographical center</a> is further west than any of the other 48 contiguous states (although the westernmost point of the lower 48 states is in Washington). <a>Central Oregon</a>'s geographical features range from <a>high desert</a> and volcanic rock formations resulting from <a>lava beds</a>. The <a>Oregon Badlands Wilderness</a> is in this region of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>

<p>
Typical of a western state, Oregon is home to a unique and diverse array of wildlife. Roughly 60 percent of the state is covered in forest,<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> while the areas west of the <a>Cascades</a> are more densely populated by forest, making up around 80 percent of the landscape. Some 60 percent of Oregon's forests are within federal land.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> Oregon is the top timber producer of the lower 48 states.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>

<p>
Most of Oregon has a generally mild climate, though there is significant variation given the variety of landscapes across the state.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> The state's western region (west of the <a>Cascade Range</a>) has an <a>oceanic climate</a>, populated by dense <a>evergreen</a> mixed forests. Western Oregon's climate is heavily influenced by the Pacific Ocean; the western third of Oregon is very wet in the winter, moderately to very wet during the spring and fall, and dry during the summer. The <a>relative humidity</a> of Western Oregon is high except during summer days, which are semi-dry to semi-humid; Eastern Oregon typically sees low humidity year-round.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state's southwestern portion, particularly the <a>Rogue Valley</a>, has a <a>Mediterranean climate</a> with drier and sunnier winters and hotter summers, similar to <a>Northern California</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Oregon's northeastern portion has a <a>steppe climate</a>, and its high terrain regions have a <a>subarctic climate</a>. Like <a>Western Europe</a>, Oregon, and the Pacific Northwest in general, is considered warm for its latitude, and the state has far milder winters at a given elevation than comparable latitudes elsewhere in North America, such as the <a>Upper Midwest</a>, <a>Ontario</a>, <a>Quebec</a> and <a>New England</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> However, the state ranks fifth for coolest summer temperatures of any state in the country, after Maine, Idaho, Wyoming, and Alaska.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The eastern two thirds of Oregon, which largely comprise high <a>desert</a>, have cold, snowy winters and very dry summers. Much of the east is semiarid to arid like the rest of the <a>Great Basin</a>, though the <a>Blue Mountains</a> are wet enough to support extensive forests. Most of Oregon receives significant snowfall, but the Willamette Valley, where 60 percent of the population lives,<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> has considerably milder winters for its latitude and typically sees only light snowfall.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Oregon's highest recorded temperature is 119 °F (48 °C) at <a>Pendleton</a> on August 10, 1898, and the lowest recorded temperature is −54 °F (−48 °C) at <a>Seneca</a> on February 10, 1933.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>

Oregon's population is largely concentrated in the Willamette Valley, which stretches from <a>Eugene</a> in the south (home of the <a>University of Oregon</a>) through <a>Corvallis</a> (home of <a>Oregon State University</a>) and <a>Salem</a> (the capital) to Portland (Oregon's largest city).<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Astoria</a>, at the mouth of the Columbia River, was the first permanent English-speaking settlement west of the <a>Rockies</a> in what is now the United States. <a>Oregon City</a>, at the end of the Oregon Trail, was the Oregon Territory's first incorporated city, and was its first capital from 1848 until 1852, when the capital was moved to Salem. <a>Bend</a>, near the geographic center of the state, is one of the ten fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the United States.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>better source needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In southern Oregon, <a>Medford</a> is a rapidly growing metro area and is home to the <a>Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport</a>, the state's third-busiest airport. To the south, near the California border, is the city of <a>Ashland</a>. <a>Eastern Oregon</a> is sparsely populated, but is home to <a>Hermiston</a>, which with a population of 18,000 is the largest and fastest-growing city in the region.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>

Oregon's diverse landscapes provide ideal environments for various types of farming.

Vast forests have historically made Oregon one of the nation's major <a>timber</a>-producing and logging states, but forest fires (such as the <a>Tillamook Burn</a>), over-harvesting, and lawsuits over the proper management of the extensive federal forest holdings have reduced the timber produced. Between 1989 and 2011, the amount of timber harvested from federal lands in Oregon dropped about 90%, although harvest levels on private land have remained relatively constant.<sup><a href="#ref_148">[148]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Even the shift in recent years towards finished goods such as paper and building materials has not slowed the decline of the timber industry in the state. The effects of this decline have included <a>Weyerhaeuser</a>'s acquisition of Portland-based <a>Willamette Industries</a> in January 2002, the relocation of <a>Louisiana-Pacific</a>'s corporate headquarters from Portland to <a>Nashville</a>, and the decline of former lumber <a>company towns</a> such as <a>Gilchrist</a>. Despite these changes, Oregon still leads the United States in <a>softwood</a> lumber production; in 2011, 4,134 million board feet (9,760,000 m<sup>3</sup>) was produced in Oregon, compared with 3,685 million board feet (8,700,000 m<sup>3</sup>) in Washington, 1,914 million board feet (4,520,000 m<sup>3</sup>) in <a>Georgia</a>, and 1,708 million board feet (4,030,000 m<sup>3</sup>) in <a>Mississippi</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_149">[149]</a></sup> The slowing of the timber and <a>lumber industry</a> has caused high unemployment rates in rural areas.<sup><a href="#ref_150">[150]</a></sup>

High technology industries located in <a>Silicon Forest</a> have been a major employer since the 1970s. <a>Tektronix</a> was the largest private employer in Oregon until the late 1980s. <a>Intel</a>'s creation and expansion of several facilities in eastern <a>Washington County</a> continued the growth that Tektronix had started.

Oregon is home to a wide variety of private colleges, the majority of which are located in the Portland area. The <a>University of Portland</a> and <a>Marylhurst University</a> are both Catholic universities located in or near Portland, affiliated with the <a>Congregation of Holy Cross</a>, and the <a>Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</a>, respectively. <a>Reed College</a>, a rigorous liberal arts college in Portland, was ranked by <i><a>Forbes</a></i> as the 52nd best college in the country in 2015.<sup><a href="#ref_206">[206]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Other private institutions in Portland include <a>Lewis & Clark College</a>; <a>Multnomah University</a>; <a>Portland Bible College</a>; <a>Warner Pacific College</a>; <a>Cascade College</a>; the <a>National University of Natural Medicine</a>; and <a>Western Seminary</a>, a theological graduate school. <a>Pacific University</a> is in the Portland suburb of <a>Forest Grove</a>. There are also private colleges further south in the Willamette Valley. McMinnville is home to <a>Linfield College</a>, while nearby Newberg is home to <a>George Fox University</a>. Salem is home to two private schools: <a>Willamette University</a> (the state's oldest, established during the provisional period) and <a>Corban University</a>. Also located near Salem is <a>Mount Angel Seminary</a>, one of America's largest Roman Catholic seminaries. The state's second medical school, the <a>College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific, Northwest</a>, is located in Lebanon. Eugene is home to three private colleges: <a>Northwest Christian University</a>, <a>New Hope Christian College</a>, and <a>Gutenberg College</a>.

<p>
A writer in the <a>Oregon Country</a> book <i>A Pacific Republic</i>, written in 1839, predicted the territory was to become an independent republic. Four years later, in 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley voted in majority for a republic government.<sup><a href="#ref_207">[207]</a></sup> The Oregon Country functioned in this way until August 13, 1848, when Oregon was annexed by the United States and a territorial government was established. Oregon maintained a territorial government until February 14, 1859, when it was granted <a>statehood</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_208">[208]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Oregon state government has a <a>separation of powers</a> similar to the <a>federal government</a>. It has three branches:

</p>
<ul><li>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature">legislative branch</a> (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameral">bicameral</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Legislative_Assembly">Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> ),</li><li>an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)">executive branch</a> which includes an "administrative department" and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Oregon">Oregon's governor</a> serving as chief executive, and</li><li>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary">judicial branch</a>, headed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice">Chief Justice</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Supreme_Court">Oregon Supreme Court</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
Governors in Oregon serve four-year terms and are limited to two consecutive terms, but an unlimited number of total terms. Oregon has no <a>lieutenant governor</a>; in case the office of governor is vacated, Article<span></span>V, Section 8a of the <a>Oregon Constitution</a> specifies that the <a>Secretary of State</a> is first in line for succession.<sup><a href="#ref_209">[209]</a></sup> The other statewide officers are <a>Treasurer</a>, <a>Attorney General</a>, <a>Superintendent</a>, and <a>Labor Commissioner</a>. The <a>biennial</a><a>Oregon Legislative Assembly</a>  consists of a thirty-member <a>Senate</a> and a sixty-member <a>House</a>. The state supreme court has seven elected justices, currently including the only two openly gay state supreme court justices in the nation. They choose one of their own to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice.

</p>
<p>
The debate over whether to move to annual sessions is a long-standing battle in Oregon politics, but the voters have resisted the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers. Because Oregon's state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over or under budget. Recent legislatures have had to be called into special sessions repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns, bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions. Oregon Initiative 71, passed in 2010, mandates the legislature to begin meeting every year, for 160 days in odd-numbered years, and 35 days in even-numbered years.

</p>
<p>
Oregonians have voted for the <a>Democratic</a> presidential candidate in every election since 1988. In 2004 and 2006, Democrats won control of the state <a>Senate</a>, and then the House. Since the late 1990s, Oregon has been represented by four Democrats and one <a>Republican</a> in the <a>U.S. House of Representatives</a>. Since 2009, the state has had two Democratic U.S. senators, <a>Ron Wyden</a> and <a>Jeff Merkley</a>. Oregon voters have elected Democratic governors in every election since 1986, most recently electing <a>Kate Brown</a> over Republican <a>Bud Pierce</a> in a 2016 special election for a two-year term, and re-electing her for a full four-year term over Republican <a>Knute Buehler</a> in 2018.

</p>
<p>
The base of Democratic support is largely concentrated in the urban centers of the Willamette Valley. The eastern two-thirds of the state beyond the Cascade Mountains typically votes Republican; in 2000 and <a>2004</a>, <a>George W. Bush</a> carried every county east of the Cascades. However, the region's sparse population means the more populous counties in the Willamette Valley usually outweigh the eastern counties in statewide elections.

</p>
<p>
In the 2002 general election, Oregon voters approved a <a>ballot measure</a> to increase the state minimum wage automatically each year according to inflationary changes, which are measured by the <a>consumer price index</a> (CPI).<sup><a href="#ref_210">[210]</a></sup> In the 2004 general election, Oregon voters passed ballot measures <a>banning same-sex marriage</a><sup><a href="#ref_211">[211]</a></sup> and <a>restricting land use regulation</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup> In the <a>2006 general election</a>, voters restricted the use of <a>eminent domain</a> and extended the state's discount prescription drug coverage.<sup><a href="#ref_213">[213]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the 2020 general election, Oregon voters approved a ballot measure to decriminalize the possession of small quantities of street drugs such as cocaine and heroin, becoming the first state in the country to do so after the drugs were originally made illegal.<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup> The state also approved a ballot measure to create a legal means of administering <a>psilocybin</a> for medicinal use.<sup><a href="#ref_215">[215]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Federal_representation">Federal representation</h3>
<p>
Like all U.S. states, Oregon is represented by two <a>senators</a>. Since the <a>1980 census</a>, Oregon has had five <a>congressional districts</a>. After Oregon was admitted to the Union, it began with a single member in the House of Representatives (<a>La Fayette Grover</a>, who served in the <a>35th United States Congress</a> for less than a month). <a>Congressional apportionment</a> increased the size of the delegation following the censuses of <a>1890</a>, <a>1910</a>, <a>1940</a>, and 1980. Following the <a>2020 census</a>, Oregon will gain a sixth congressional seat. It will be filled in the <a>2022 Congressional Elections</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_216">[216]</a></sup> A <a>detailed list of the past and present Congressional delegations from Oregon</a> is available.

</p>
<p>
The <a>United States District Court for the District of Oregon</a> hears federal cases in the state. The court has courthouses in <a>Portland</a>, <a>Eugene</a>, Medford, and Pendleton. Also in Portland is the federal bankruptcy court, with a second branch in Eugene.<sup><a href="#ref_217">[217]</a></sup> Oregon (among other western states and territories) is in the <a>9th Court of Appeals</a>. One of the court's meeting places is at the <a>Pioneer Courthouse</a> in downtown Portland, a National Historic Landmark built-in 1869.

<p>
Political opinions in Oregon are geographically split by the <a>Cascade Range</a>, with western Oregon being more <a>liberal</a> and <a>Eastern Oregon</a> being <a>conservative</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_218">[218]</a></sup> In a 2008 analysis of the 2004 presidential election, a political analyst found that according to the application of a <a>Likert scale</a>, Oregon boasted both the most liberal Kerry voters and the most conservative Bush voters, making it the most politically polarized state in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_219">[219]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
While Republicans typically win more counties by running up huge margins in the east, the Democratic tilt of the more populated west is usually enough to swing the entire state Democratic. In 2008, for instance, Republican Senate incumbent <a>Gordon H. Smith</a> lost his bid for a third term, even though he <a>carried all but eight counties</a>. His Democratic challenger, <a>Jeff Merkley</a>, won Multnomah County by 142,000 votes, more than double the overall margin of victory.

</p>
<p>
During Oregon's history, it has adopted many electoral reforms proposed during the <a>Progressive Era</a>, through the efforts of <a>William S. U'Ren</a> and his <a>Direct Legislation League</a>. Under his leadership, the state overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure in 1902 that created the <a>initiative</a> and <a>referendum</a> for citizens to introduce or approve proposed laws or amendments to the state constitution directly, making Oregon the first state to adopt such a system. Today, roughly half of U.S. states do so.<sup><a href="#ref_220">[220]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In following years, the <a>primary election</a> to select <a>party</a> candidates was adopted in 1904, and in 1908 the Oregon Constitution was amended to include recall of public officials. More recent amendments include the nation's first doctor-assisted suicide law,<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup> called the <a>Death with Dignity Act</a> (which was challenged, unsuccessfully, in 2005 by the <a>Bush administration</a> in a case heard by the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a>), <a>legalization</a> of <a>medical cannabis</a>, and among the nation's strongest <a>anti-urban sprawl</a> and pro-environment laws.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> More recently, <a>2004's Measure 37</a> reflects a backlash against such land-use laws. However, a further ballot measure in 2007, <a>Measure 49</a>, curtailed many of the provisions of 37.

</p>
<p>
Of the <a>measures placed on the ballot</a> since 1902, the people have passed 99 of the 288 initiatives and 25 of the 61 referendums on the ballot, though not all of them survived challenges in courts (see <i><a>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</a></i>, for an example). During the same period, the legislature has referred 363 measures to the people, of which 206 have passed.

</p>
<p>
Oregon pioneered the American use of <a>postal voting</a>, beginning with experimentation approved by the <a>Oregon Legislative Assembly</a> in 1981 and culminating with a <a>1998 ballot measure</a> mandating that all counties conduct elections by mail. It remains one of just two states, the other being Washington, where <a>voting by mail</a> is the only method of voting.

</p>
<p>
In 1994, Oregon adopted the Oregon Health Plan, which made health care available to most of its citizens without private health insurance.<sup><a href="#ref_222">[222]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the <a>U.S. Electoral College</a>, Oregon casts seven votes. Oregon has supported Democratic candidates in the last nine elections. Democratic incumbent <a>Barack Obama</a> won the state by a margin of twelve percentage points, with over 54% of the popular vote in 2012. In the 2016 election, <a>Hillary Clinton</a> won Oregon by 11 percentage points.<sup><a href="#ref_223">[223]</a></sup> In the <a>2020 election</a>, <a>Joe Biden</a> won Oregon by 16 percentage points over his opponent, <a>Donald Trump</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_224">[224]</a></sup>

Oregon is home to three major professional sports teams: the <a>Portland Trail Blazers</a> of the <a>NBA</a>, the <a>Portland Thorns FC</a> of the <a>NWSL</a> and the <a>Portland Timbers</a> of <a>MLS</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_225">[225]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until 2011, the only major professional sports team in Oregon was the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association. From the 1970s to the 1990s, the Blazers were one of the most successful teams in the NBA in terms of both win-loss record and attendance.<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> In the early 21st century, the team's popularity declined due to personnel and financial issues, but revived after the departure of controversial players and the acquisition of new players such as <a>Brandon Roy</a> and <a>LaMarcus Aldridge</a>, and still later <a>Damian Lillard</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_227">[227]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_228">[228]</a></sup> The Blazers play in the <a>Moda Center</a> in Portland's Lloyd District, which also is home to the <a>Portland Winterhawks</a> of the <a>junior</a><a>Western Hockey League</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Portland Timbers play at <a>Providence Park</a>, just west of downtown Portland. The Timbers have a strong following, with the team regularly selling out its games.<sup><a href="#ref_230">[230]</a></sup> The Timbers repurposed the formerly multi-use stadium into a <a>soccer-specific stadium</a> in fall 2010, increasing the seating in the process.<sup><a href="#ref_231">[231]</a></sup> The Timbers operate Portland Thorns FC, a women's soccer team that has played in the <a>National Women's Soccer League</a> since the league's first season in 2013. The Thorns, who also play at Providence Park, have won two league championships, in the inaugural <a>2013 season</a> and also in <a>2017</a>, and have been by far the NWSL's attendance leader in each of the league's seasons.

<p>
Eugene and Hillsboro have minor-league baseball teams: the <a>Eugene Emeralds</a> and the <a>Hillsboro Hops</a> both play in the <a>High-A</a><a>High-A West</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_232">[232]</a></sup> Portland has had minor-league baseball teams in the past, including the <a>Portland Beavers</a> and <a>Portland Rockies</a>, who played most recently at Providence Park when it was known as PGE Park. Salem also previously had a <a>Class A Short Season</a><a>Northwest League</a>  team, the <a>Salem-Keizer Volcanoes</a> that was not included in the <a>2021 Minor League Baseball reorganization</a>. The Volcanoes ownership later formed the amateur <a>Mavericks Independent Baseball League</a>, which is fully based in Salem.<sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Oregon State Beavers</a> and the University of Oregon Ducks football teams of the <a>Pac-12 Conference</a> meet annually in the <a>Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry</a>. Both schools have had recent success in other sports as well: Oregon State won back-to-back <a>college baseball championships</a> in 2006 and 2007,<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup> winning a third in 2018;<sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup> and the University of Oregon won back-to-back <a>NCAA men's cross country championships</a> in 2007 and 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup>
