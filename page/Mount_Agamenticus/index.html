<b>Mount Agamenticus</b> is a 692 ft (211 m) high <a>monadnock</a> in the town of <a>York, Maine</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>  The area surrounding the summit is a park reservation which provides habitat for wildlife and a venue for recreation. The greater Agamenticus region covers nearly 30,000 acres (12,000 ha) in the southern <a>Maine</a> towns of <a>Eliot</a>, <a>Ogunquit</a>, <a>South Berwick</a>, <a>Wells</a> and York.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Though under 700 ft (210 m) high, Mount Agamenticus was historically a noted landmark for sailors.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> It is high enough that from its peak on a clear day one can see the skyscrapers of <a>Boston</a><sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> to the south, <a>Cape Elizabeth</a> and the entrance to <a>Casco Bay</a> to the north, and the <a>Presidential Range</a>, including <a>Mount Washington</a>, to the west. Looking out to sea, the <a>Isles of Shoals</a> - about 10 mi (16 km) off York - and <a>Boon Island</a> - about 6 mi (9.7 km) from the coast - are also clearly visible. The Agamenticus summit can be seen on a clear day from the lookout and the fire control tower at <a>Halibut Point State Park</a> in <a>Rockport, Massachusetts</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
Mount Agamenticus is also affectionately known by older locals as "Big A," the nickname of a <a>ski</a> slope that once operated on its northeast flank,<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> remnants of which can be seen both near the summit and along the trails. A memorial cairn to <a>Mi'kmaq</a> chief <a>St. Aspinquid</a>, who allegedly converted to Christianity, is located near the summit.

<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
In 1614, Captain <a>John Smith</a> explored and charted the <a>Gulf of Maine</a>.  

</p>
<h3 id="Name">Name</h3>
<p>
Upon returning to <a>London</a> Mason presented his record of the <a>New World</a>, complete with <a>aboriginal</a> place names, to <a>Prince Charles</a>, "...humbly entreating his Highnesse hee would please to change their barbarous names for such English, as posteritie might say Prince Charles was their God-father..."  He complied, and his choices were featured on the map published in 1616 that accompanied Smith's <i>A Description of New England</i>.  On paper, the mountain's <a>Indian</a> name, "Sassanows," became "Snadoun Hill."  But many royal recommendations were not retained.  Instead, the mountain would assume the general name of the York settlement of 1630, the "Plantation of Agamenticus," which itself took the <a>Abenaki</a> name for the <a>York River</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Plantation_of%20Agamenticus">Plantation of Agamenticus</h3>
<p>
The Agamenticus plantation was personally established from afar by <a>Sir Ferdinando Gorges</a>, whom received an original land charter in 1606.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="St._Aspinquid">St. Aspinquid</h3>
<p>
<a>St. Aspinquid</a> (St. Aspenquid) was an alleged  <a>Mi'kmaq</a><a>sachem</a>  around whom little is known, including whether he ever even existed. 

</p>
<p>
He allegedly was murdered<sup>[<i><a><span>clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> in 1696 and was declared a <a>martyr</a><sup>[<i><a><span>clarification needed</span></a></i>]</sup> and buried atop Mount Agamenticus.

</p>
<p>
According to legend, Saint Aspinquid (sometimes <i>Aspenquid</i>) was born in May 1588, and after converting to <a>Christianity</a>, spread the <a>gospel</a> to tribes across the continent.

</p>
<p>
His funeral and burial atop Mount Agamenticus in May 1682, at which 6,712 animals were allegedly sacrificed, was allegedly attended by hundreds, even thousands, of Native Americans.  

</p>
<p>
Numerous people have written and questioned the legendary account, even to the point of challenging the existence of St. Aspinquid. Some have suggested the Saint is a fanciful version of real Chief <a>Passaconaway</a>.  In the 1881 essay <i>A Winter Drive</i>, <a>Seacoast</a> literary legend <a>Sarah Orne Jewett</a> remarked that "...I could never trace this legend beyond a story in one of the county newspapers, and I have never heard any tradition among the people that bears the least likeness to it."

</p>
<p>
A symbolic <a>cairn</a> on the summit stands as memorial to the Aspinquid legend.

<h3 id="As_a%20ski%20area">As a ski area</h3>
<p>
Mount Agamenticus has the highest elevation of any hill within its distance to the ocean from Portland, Maine, to Brownsville, Texas.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>  The ski area there, The Big A, had a 2,400 foot double chairlift, a 1,200 foot T-Bar, and a rope tow, and was supplemented with both snowmaking and night skiing.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>  At its peak the area had nine trails spread over 500’ of vertical drop, including a mile long Beginner, two novice, two intermediate, and four Advanced. <sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> the facility had a summit lodge, complete with a ski shop<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> and 400 car parking lot - on top the mountain, not at its base.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Today">Today</h2>
<p>
Today there is a park at the summit, with a trail network covering the area.  There is a large cell phone mast at the top, arrayed with various other antenna. It is one of the best places for viewing <a>hawks</a> in <a>New England</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
In addition to a road to the summit and limited parking there, the mountain has a network of trails for hiking. Its short access trail from the main parking area at the base leads to the ring trail, which in circles the mountains summit. Feeder trails off of it offer access to the top.
