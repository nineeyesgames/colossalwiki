<p>
<b>Victoria</b> (abbreviated as <b>Vic</b>) is a <a>state</a> in southeastern <a>Australia</a>. It is the second-smallest state with a <a>land area</a> of 227,444 km<sup>2</sup> (87,817 sq mi) and the most densely populated state in Australia (28 per km<sup>2</sup>). Victoria is bordered with <a>New South Wales</a> to the north and <a>South Australia</a> to the west, and is bounded by the <a>Bass Strait</a> to the south (with the exception of a small land border with <a>Tasmania</a> located along <a>Boundary Islet</a>), the <a>Great Australian Bight</a> portion of the <a>Southern Ocean</a> to the southwest, and the <a>Tasman Sea</a> (a <a>marginal sea</a> of the <a>South Pacific Ocean</a>) to the southeast. The state encompasses a range of climates and geographical features from its <a>temperate</a> coastal and central regions to the <a>Victorian Alps</a> in the north-east and the <a>semi-arid</a> north-west.

</p>
<p>
Victoria has a population of over 6.6 million,<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> the majority of which is concentrated in the central south area surrounding <a>Port Phillip Bay</a>, and in particular in the <a>metropolitan area</a> of <a>Greater Melbourne</a>, Victoria's <a>state capital</a> and <a>largest city</a> and also <a>Australia's second-largest city</a>, where over three quarters of the Victorian population live. The state is home to <a>four of Australia's 20 largest cities</a>: Melbourne, <a>Geelong</a>, <a>Ballarat</a> and <a>Bendigo</a>. The population is <a>diverse</a>, with 35.1% of inhabitants being <a>immigrants</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Victoria is home to numerous <a>Aboriginal</a> groups, including the <a>Boonwurrung</a>, the <a>Bratauolung</a>, the <a>Djadjawurrung</a>, the <a>Gunai</a>, the <a>Gunditjmara</a>, the <a>Taungurong</a>, the <a>Wathaurong</a>, the <a>Wurundjeri</a>, and the <a>Yorta Yorta</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> There were more than 30 <a>Aboriginal languages</a> spoken in the area prior to European colonisation. In 1770 <a>James Cook</a> claimed the east coast of the <a>Australian continent</a> for the <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a>, and from 1788 the area that is now Victoria was a part of the colony of <a>New South Wales</a>. The first European settlement in the area occurred in 1803 at <a>Sullivan Bay</a>. Much of what is now Victoria was included in 1836 in the <a>Port Phillip District</a> of New South Wales. Named in honour of <a>Queen Victoria</a>, Victoria was separated from New South Wales and established as a separate <a>Crown colony</a> in 1851, achieving <a>responsible government</a> in 1855.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> The <a>Victorian gold rush</a> in the 1850s and 1860s significantly increased Victoria's population and wealth. By the time of <a>Australian Federation</a> in 1901, Melbourne had become the largest city in <a>Australasia</a>, and served as the federal capital of Australia until <a>Canberra</a> was opened in 1927. The state continued to grow strongly through various periods of the 20th and early 21st centuries as a result of high levels of international and interstate migration.

</p>
<p>
Victoria has 38 seats in the <a>Australian House of Representatives</a> and 12 seats in the <a>Australian Senate</a>. At state level, the <a>Parliament of Victoria</a> consists of the <a>Legislative Assembly</a> and the <a>Legislative Council</a>. The <a>Labor Party</a>, led by <a>Daniel Andrews</a> as <a>premier</a>, has governed Victoria since 2014. The <a>Governor of Victoria</a>, the representative of the <a>Monarchy of Australia</a> in the state, is currently <a>Linda Dessau</a>. Victoria is divided into <a>79 local government areas</a>, as well as several <a>unincorporated areas</a> which the state administers directly.

</p>
<p>
Victoria's economy is the <a>second-largest among Australian states</a> and is highly diversified, with service sectors predominating. Culturally, Melbourne hosts a number of museums, art galleries, and theatres, and is also described as the world's sporting capital,<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> and the spiritual home of <a>Australian cricket</a> and <a>Australian rules football</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>

The state of Victoria was originally home to many <a>Aboriginal Australian</a> nations that had occupied the land for tens of thousands of years before <a>European settlement</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> According to <a>Gary Presland</a>, Aboriginal people have lived in Victoria for about 40,000 years,<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> living a semi-nomadic existence of fishing, hunting and gathering, and farming eels.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the <a>Keilor Archaeological Site</a> a human hearth excavated in 1971 was radiocarbon-dated to about 31,000 years <a>BP</a>, making Keilor one of the earliest sites of human habitation in Australia.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> A <a>cranium</a> found at the site has been dated at between 12,000<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> and 14,700 years <a>BP</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Archaeological sites in <a>Tasmania</a> and on the <a>Bass Strait</a> Islands have been dated to between 20,000 – 35,000 years ago, when sea levels were 130 metres below present level allowing Aborigines to move across the region of southern Victoria and on to the land bridge of the Bassian plain to <a>Tasmania</a> by at least 35,000 years ago.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the Ice Age about 20,000 years <a>BP</a>, the area now the bay of <a>Port Phillip</a> would have been dry land, and the Yarra and Werribee river would have joined to flow through the heads then south and south west through the Bassian plain before meeting the ocean to the west. Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands became separated from mainland Australia around 12,000 BP, when the sea level was approximately 50m below present levels.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> Port Phillip was flooded by post-glacial <a>rising sea levels</a> between 8000 and 6000 years ago.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Oral history and creation stories from the <a>Wada wurrung</a>, <a>Woiwurrung</a> and <a>Bun wurrung</a> languages describe the flooding of the bay. Hobsons Bay was once a kangaroo hunting ground. Creation stories describe how <a>Bunjil</a> was responsible for the formation of the bay,<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> or the bay was flooded when the <a>Yarra river</a> was created (Yarra Creation Story.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>)

<p>
Victoria, like <a>Queensland</a>, was named after <a>Queen Victoria</a>, who had been on the British throne for 14 years when the colony was established in 1851.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After the founding of the colony of New South Wales in 1788, Australia was divided into an eastern half named New South Wales and a western half named <a>New Holland</a>, under the <a>administration</a> of the colonial government in Sydney. The first British settlement in the area later known as Victoria was established in October 1803 under Lieutenant-Governor <a>David Collins</a> at Sullivan Bay on Port Phillip. It consisted of 402 people (five government officials, nine officers of marines, two drummers, and 39 privates, five soldiers' wives and a child, 307 convicts, 17 convicts' wives, and seven children).<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> They had been sent from England in <a>HMS <i>Calcutta</i></a> under the command of Captain <a>Daniel Woodriff</a>, principally out of fear that the French, who had been exploring the area, might establish their own settlement and thereby challenge British rights to the continent.

</p>
<p>
In 1826, Colonel Stewart, Captain Samuel Wright, and Lieutenant Burchell were sent in <a>HMS <i>Fly</i></a> (Captain Wetherall) and the brigs <i>Dragon</i> and <i>Amity</i>, took a number of convicts and a small force composed of detachments of the 3rd and 93rd regiments. The expedition landed at Settlement Point (now <a>Corinella</a>), on the eastern side of Western Port Bay, which was the headquarters until the abandonment of Western Port at the insistence of Governor Darling about 12 months afterwards.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Victoria's next settlement was at <a>Portland</a>, on the south west coast of what is now Victoria. <a>Edward Henty</a> settled Portland Bay in 1834.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Melbourne was founded in 1835 by <a>John Batman</a>, who set up a base in <a>Indented Head</a>, and <a>John Pascoe Fawkner</a>. From settlement, the region around Melbourne was known as the Port Phillip District, a separately administered part of New South Wales. Shortly after, the site now known as Geelong was surveyed by Assistant Surveyor W. H. Smythe, three weeks after Melbourne. And in 1838, <a>Geelong</a> was officially declared a town, despite earlier European settlements dating back to 1826.

</p>
<p>
On 6 June 1835, just under two years before Melbourne was officially recognised as a settlement, John Batman, the leader of the <a>Port Phillip Association</a> presented <a>Wurundjeri</a> Elders with a land use agreement. This document, now referred to as the <a>Batman treaty</a>, was later given to the British government to claim that local Aboriginal people had given Batman access to their land in exchange for goods and rations. Today, the meaning and interpretation of this treaty is contested. Some argue it was pretence for taking Aboriginal land in exchange for trinkets, while others argue it was significant in that it sought to recognise <a>Aboriginal land rights</a>.

</p>
<p>
The exact location of the meeting between Batman and the <a>Kulin Ngurungaeta</a> (head clan-men) with whom he made the treaty is unknown, although it is believed to have been by the <a>Merri Creek</a>. According to historian <a>Meyer Eidelson</a>, it is generally believed to have occurred on the Merri near modern-day Rushall Station.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Colonial_Victoria">Colonial Victoria</h3>
<p>
On 1 July 1851, writs were issued for the election of the first Victorian Legislative Council, and the absolute independence of Victoria from New South Wales was established proclaiming a new Colony of Victoria.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> Days later, still in 1851 gold was discovered near <a>Ballarat</a>, and subsequently at <a>Bendigo</a>. Later discoveries occurred at many sites across Victoria. This triggered one of the <a>largest gold rushes</a> the world has ever seen. The colony grew rapidly in both population and economic power. In 10 years, the population of Victoria increased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. All sorts of gold records were produced, including the "richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the world" and the <a>largest gold nugget</a>. In the decade 1851–1860 Victoria produced 20 million ounces of gold, one-third of the world's output.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Immigrants arrived from all over the world to search for gold, especially from Ireland and China.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> By 1857, 26,000 Chinese miners worked in Victoria, and their legacy is particularly strong in Bendigo and its environs.

</p>
<p>
In 1854 at Ballarat, an armed rebellion against the government of Victoria was made by miners protesting against <a>mining taxes</a> (the "<a>Eureka Stockade</a>"). This was crushed by British troops, but the confrontation persuaded the colonial authorities to reform the administration of mining concessions (reducing the hated mining licence fees) and extend the electoral franchise. The following year, the Imperial Parliament granted Victoria responsible government with the passage of the Colony of Victoria Act 1855. Some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion went on to become members of the Victorian Parliament.

</p>
<p>
In 1857, reflecting the growing presence of Irish Catholic immigrants, <a>John O'Shanassy</a> became the colony's second Premier with the former <a>Young Irelander</a>, <a>Charles Gavan Duffy</a> as his deputy. Melbourne's Protestant establishment was ill-prepared "to countenance so startling a novelty".<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> In 1858–59, <i>Melbourne Punch</i> cartoons linked Duffy and O'Shanassy to the terrors of the <a>French Revolution</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1862 Duffy's Land Act attempted, but failed, through a system of extended pastoral licences, to break the land-holding monopoly of the so-called <a>"squatter" class</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> In 1871, having led, on behalf of small farmers,  opposition to Premier <a>Sir James McCulloch</a>'s <a>land tax</a>, Duffy, himself, was briefly Premier. 

</p>
<p>
In 1893 widespread bank failures brought to an end a sustained period of prosperity and of increasingly wild speculation in land and construction. Melbourne nonetheless retained, as the legacy of the gold rush, its status as Australia's primary financial centre and largest city.

</p>
<p>
In 1901, Victoria became a state in the <a>Commonwealth of Australia</a>. While  <a>Canberra</a> was being built, Melbourne served until 1927 as country's first federal capital.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>

<p>
Victoria's northern border follows a straight line from <a>Cape Howe</a> to the start of the <a>Murray River</a> and then follows the Murray River as the remainder of the northern border. On the Murray River, the border is the southern bank of the river. This precise definition was not established until 1980, when a ruling by <a>Justice Ninian Stephen</a> of the <a>High Court of Australia</a> settled the question as to which state had jurisdiction in the unlawful death of a man on an island in the middle of the river. The ruling clarified that no part of the watercourse is in Victoria.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> The border also rests at the southern end of the <a>Great Dividing Range</a>, which stretches along the east coast and terminates west of Ballarat. It is bordered by South Australia to the west and shares Australia's shortest land border with <a>Tasmania</a>. The official border between Victoria and Tasmania is at 39°12' S, which passes through <a>Boundary Islet</a> in the <a>Bass Strait</a> for 85 metres.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Victoria contains many topographically, geologically and climatically diverse areas, ranging from the wet, <a>temperate</a> climate of <a>Gippsland</a> in the southeast to the snow-covered <a>Victorian alpine areas</a> which rise to almost 2,000 m (6,600 ft), with <a>Mount Bogong</a> the highest peak at 1,986 m (6,516 ft). There are extensive semi-arid plains to the west and northwest. There is an extensive series of river systems in Victoria. Most notable is the <a>Murray River</a> system. Other rivers include: <a>Ovens River</a>, <a>Goulburn River</a>, <a>Patterson River</a>, <a>King River</a>, <a>Campaspe River</a>, <a>Loddon River</a>, <a>Wimmera River</a>, <a>Elgin River</a>, <a>Barwon River</a>, <a>Thomson River</a>, <a>Snowy River</a>, <a>Latrobe River</a>, <a>Yarra River</a>, <a>Maribyrnong River</a>, <a>Mitta River</a>, <a>Hopkins River</a>, <a>Merri River</a> and <a>Kiewa River</a>. The state symbols include the <a>pink heath</a> (state flower), <a>Leadbeater's possum</a> (state animal) and the <a>helmeted honeyeater</a> (state bird).

</p>
<p>
According to <a>Geoscience Australia</a>, the geographic centre of Victoria is located in <a>Mandurang</a> at 36° 51' 15"S, 144° 16' 52" E. The small rural town is located 10 km (6 mi) south of <a>Bendigo</a>. Due to its central location and the region's historical ties to the gold rush, the town is widely regarded as the "Heart of Gold".

</p>
<p>
The state's capital, Melbourne, contains about 70% of the state's population and dominates its economy, media, and culture. For other cities and towns, see <a>list of localities (Victoria)</a> and <a>local government areas of Victoria</a>.

<p>
Victoria has a varied climate despite its small size. It ranges from semi-arid temperate with hot summers in the north-west, to temperate and cool along the coast. Victoria's main land feature, the Great Dividing Range, produces a cooler, mountain climate in the centre of the state. Winters along the coast of the state, particularly around <a>Melbourne</a>, are relatively mild (<i>see chart at right)</i>.

</p>
<p>
The coastal plain south of the Great Dividing Range has Victoria's mildest climate. Air from the <a>Southern Ocean</a> helps reduce the heat of summer and the cold of winter. Melbourne and other large cities are located in this temperate region.

</p>
<p>
<a>The Mallee</a> and upper <a>Wimmera</a> are Victoria's warmest regions with hot winds blowing from nearby semi-deserts. Average temperatures exceed 32 °C (90 °F) during summer and 15 °C (59 °F) in winter. Except at cool mountain elevations, the inland monthly temperatures are 2–7 °C (4–13 °F) warmer than around Melbourne (see chart). Victoria's highest maximum temperature of 48.8 °C (119.8 °F) was recorded in <a>Hopetoun</a> on 7 February 2009, during the <a>2009 southeastern Australia heat wave</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Victorian Alps in the northeast are the coldest part of Victoria. The Alps are part of the Great Dividing Range mountain system extending east–west through the centre of Victoria. Average temperatures are less than 9 °C (48 °F) in winter and below 0 °C (32 °F) in the highest parts of the ranges. The state's lowest minimum temperature of −11.7 °C (10.9 °F) was recorded at <a>Omeo</a> on 15 June 1965, and again at <a>Falls Creek</a> on 3 July 1970.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Temperature extremes for the state are listed in the table below:

Rainfall in Victoria increases from south to the northeast, with higher averages in areas of high altitude. Mean annual rainfall exceeds 1,800 millimetres (71 inches) in some parts of the northeast but is less than 280 mm (11 in) in the Mallee.

</p>
<p>
Rain is heaviest in the <a>Otway Ranges</a> and Gippsland in southern Victoria and in the mountainous northeast. Snow generally falls only in the mountains and hills in the centre of the state. Rain falls most frequently in winter, but summer precipitation is heavier. Rainfall is most reliable in Gippsland and the <a>Western District</a>, making them both leading farming areas. Victoria's highest recorded daily rainfall was 377.8 mm (14.87 in) at <a>Tidal River</a> in <a>Wilsons Promontory National Park</a> on 23 March 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>

At March 2020 Victoria had a population of 6,689,377.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> The <a>Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> estimates that the population may well reach 7.2 million by 2050.

</p>
<p>
Victoria's founding <a>Anglo-Celtic</a> population has been supplemented by successive waves of <a>migrants</a> from <a>Southern</a> and <a>Eastern Europe</a>, <a>Asia</a> and, most recently, <a>Africa</a> and the <a>Middle East</a>. Victoria's population is ageing in proportion with the average of the remainder of the Australian population.

</p>
<p>
About 72% of Victorians are Australian-born. This figure falls to around 66% in Melbourne but rises to higher than 95% in some rural areas in the north west of the state. Less than 1% of Victorians identify themselves as <a>Aboriginal</a>.

</p>
<p>
More than 75% of Victorians live in Melbourne, located in the state's south. The greater Melbourne metropolitan area is home to an estimated 4,850,740 people.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Urban centres outside Melbourne include <a>Geelong</a>, <a>Ballarat</a>, <a>Bendigo</a>, <a>Shepparton</a>, <a>Mildura</a>, <a>Warrnambool</a>, <a>Wodonga</a> and the <a>Latrobe Valley</a>.

</p>
<p>
Victoria is Australia's most urbanised state: nearly 90% of residents living in cities and towns. State Government efforts to decentralise population have included an official campaign run since 2003 to encourage Victorians to settle in regional areas,<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> however Melbourne continues to rapidly outpace these areas in terms of population growth.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>

<p>
Victoria has a parliamentary form of government based on the <a>Westminster System</a>. Legislative power resides in the Parliament consisting of the Governor (the representative of the Queen), the executive (the Government), and two legislative chambers. The <a>Parliament of Victoria</a> consists of the lower house <a>Legislative Assembly</a>, the upper house <a>Legislative Council</a> and the <a>Queen of Australia</a>.

</p>
<p>
Eighty-eight members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member electorates.

</p>
<p>
In November 2006, the Victorian Legislative Council elections were held under a new multi-member proportional representation system. The State of Victoria was divided into eight electorates with each electorate represented by five representatives elected by <a>Single Transferable Vote</a>. The total number of upper house members was reduced from 44 to 40 and their term of office is now the same as the lower house members—four years. Elections for the Victorian Parliament are now fixed and occur in November every four years. Prior to the 2006 election, the Legislative Council consisted of 44 members elected to eight-year terms from 22 two-member electorates.

Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working and middle class western, northern and inner-city suburbs, and the regional cities of <a>Ballarat</a>, <a>Bendigo</a> and <a>Geelong</a>. The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern suburbs and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres.

Victoria's <a>state school</a> system dates back to 1872, when the colonial government legislated to make schooling both free and compulsory. The state's public secondary school system began in 1905. Before then, only private secondary schooling was available. Today, a Victorian school education consists of seven years of primary schooling (including one preparatory year) and six years of secondary schooling.

</p>
<p>
The final years of secondary school are optional for children aged over 17. Victorian children generally begin school at age five or six. On completing secondary school, students earn the <a>Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE)</a> or <a>Victorian Certificate of Applied Learning (VCAL)</a>. Students who successfully complete their VCE also receive an <a>ATAR</a>, to determine university admittance.

</p>
<p>
Victorian schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the <a>Victoria Department of Education</a><a>[2]</a> . Students do not pay tuition fees, but some extra costs are levied. Private fee-paying schools include parish schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and independent schools similar to British public schools. Independent schools are usually affiliated with Protestant churches. Victoria also has several private Jewish and Islamic primary and secondary schools. Private schools also receive some public funding. All schools must comply with government-set curriculum standards. In addition, Victoria has six government <a>selective schools</a>, <a>Melbourne High School</a> for boys, <a>MacRobertson Girls' High School</a> for girls, the coeducational schools <a>John Monash Science School</a>, <a>Nossal High School</a> and <a>Suzanne Cory High School</a>, and the <a>Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School</a>. Students at these schools are exclusively admitted on the basis of an academic selective entry test.

</p>
<p>
As of February 2019, Victoria had 1,529 public schools, 496 Catholic schools and 219 independent schools. Just under 631,500 students were enrolled in public schools, and just over 357,000 in private schools. Over 58 per cent of private students attend Catholic schools. More than 552,300 students were enrolled in primary schools and more than 418,600 in secondary schools. Retention rates for the final two years of secondary school were 84.3 per cent for public school students and 91.5 per cent for private school students. Victoria has about 46,523 full-time teachers.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Tertiary_education">Tertiary education</h3>
<p>
Victoria has <a>nine universities</a>. The first to offer degrees, the <a>University of Melbourne</a>, enrolled its first student in 1855. The largest, <a>Monash University</a>, has an enrolment of over 83,000 students—more than any other Australian university.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The number of students enrolled in Victorian universities was 418,447 in 2018, an increase of 5.3% on the previous year. International students made up 40% of enrolments and account for the highest percentage of pre-paid university tuition fees.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> The largest number of enrolments were recorded in the fields of business, administration and economics, with nearly 30% of all students, followed by arts, humanities, and social science, with 18% of enrolments.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Victoria has 12 government-run institutions of technical and further education (<a>TAFE</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> The first vocational institution in the state was the Melbourne Mechanics' Institute (established in 1839), which is now the <a>Melbourne Athenaeum</a>. More than 1,000 adult education organisations are registered to provide recognised TAFE programs. In 2014, there were 443,000 students enrolled in vocational education in the state. By 2018, the number of students in the sector had dropped by 40 per cent to 265,000—a five-year low which the education department attributed to withdrawal of funding to low-quality providers and a societal shift to university education.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>

The state of Victoria is the second largest economy in Australia after New South Wales, accounting for a quarter of the nation's gross domestic product. The total <a>gross state product</a> (GSP) at current prices for Victoria was A$459 billion in June 2020, with a GSP per capita of A$68,996.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Finance and insurance is Victoria's largest income producing sector, while the health care and social assistance sector is the state's biggest employer. The shift towards service industries in the preceding decades has seen manufacturing lose its mantle as Victoria's largest employer and income producer.

<p>
During 2003–04, the gross value of Victorian agricultural production increased by 17% to $8.7 billion. This represented 24% of national agricultural production total gross value. As of 2004, an estimated 32,463 farms occupied around 136,000 square kilometres (52,500 sq mi) of Victorian land. This comprises more than 60% of the state's total land surface. Victorian farms range from small horticultural outfits to large-scale livestock and grain productions. A quarter of farmland is used to grow consumable crops.

</p>
<p>
More than 26,000 square kilometres (10,000 sq mi) of Victorian farmland are sown for grain, mostly in the state's west. More than 50% of this area is sown for wheat, 33% for barley and 7% for oats. A further 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) is sown for hay. In 2003–04, Victorian farmers produced more than 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2 million tonnes of barley. Victorian farms produce nearly 90% of Australian pears and third of apples. It is also a leader in stone fruit production. The main vegetable crops include asparagus, broccoli, carrots, potatoes and tomatoes. Last year, 121,200 tonnes of pears and 270,000 tonnes of tomatoes were produced.

</p>
<p>
More than 14 million sheep and 5 million lambs graze over 10% of Victorian farms, mostly in the state's north and west. In 2004, nearly 10 million lambs and sheep were slaughtered for local consumption and export. Victoria also exports live sheep to the Middle East for meat and to the rest of the world for breeding. More than 108,000 tonnes of wool clip was also produced—one-fifth of the Australian total.

</p>
<p>
Victoria is the centre of dairy farming in Australia. It is home to 60% of Australia's 3 million dairy cattle and produces nearly two-thirds of the nation's milk, almost 6.4 billion litres. The state also has 2.4 million beef cattle, with more than 2.2 million cattle and calves slaughtered each year. In 2003–04, Victorian commercial fishing crews and aquaculture industry produced 11,634 tonnes of seafood valued at nearly A$109 million. Blacklipped <a>abalone</a> is the mainstay of the catch, bringing in A$46 million, followed by southern <a>rock lobster</a> worth A$13.7 million. Most abalone and rock lobster is exported to Asia.

</p>
<h3 id="Manufacturing">Manufacturing</h3>
<p>
Victoria has a diverse range of manufacturing enterprises and Melbourne is considered Australia's most important industrial city. The post-World War II manufacturing boom was fuelled by international investment; attracted to the state by the availability of cheap land close to the city and inexpensive energy from the <a>Latrobe Valley</a>. Victoria produced 26.4% of total manufacturing output in Australia in 2015–16, behind New South Wales at 32.4%.

</p>
<p>
Machinery and equipment manufacturing is the state's most valuable manufacturing activity, followed by food and beverage products, petrochemicals and chemicals. Prominent manufacturing plants in the state include the <a>Portland</a> and <a>Point Henry</a> aluminium smelters, owned by <a>Alcoa</a>; <a>Geelong</a> and <a>Altona</a> oil refineries; a major petrochemical facility at <a>Laverton</a>; and Victorian-based <a>CSL</a>, a global biotechnology company that produces vaccines and plasma products, among others. Victoria also plays an important role in providing goods for the <a>defence industry</a>.

</p>
<p>
Victoria proportionally relies on manufacturing more than any other state in Australia, constituting 8.6% of total state product; slightly higher than South Australia at 8.0%. However, this proportion has been declining for three decades; in 1990 at the time of the <a>early 1990s recession</a> manufacturing constituted 20.3% of total state output. Manufacturing output peaked in absolute terms in 2008, reaching $28.8 billion and has slowly fallen over the decade to $26.8 billion in 2016 (−0.77% per annum). Since 1990, manufacturing employment has also fallen in both aggregate (367,700 to 274,400 workers) and proportional (17.8% to 9.0%) terms. The strong Australian dollar as a result of the <a>2000s mining boom</a>, small population and isolation, high wage base and the general shift of manufacturing production towards developing countries have been cited as some of the reasons for this decline.

</p>
<p>
Historically, Victoria has been a hub for the manufacturing plants of the major car brands <a>Ford</a>, <a>Toyota</a> and <a>Holden</a>; however, closure announcements by all three companies in the 2010s has meant Australia will completely lose their car manufacturing industry by the end of 2017. Holden's announcement occurred in May 2013 following Ford's decision in December the previous year (Ford's Victorian plants, in Broadmeadows and Geelong, closed in October 2016).<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> Toyota followed suit in February 2014 with an expected announcement as without Holden or Ford, local supply chains would struggle to create the <a>economics of scale</a> required to supply one manufacturer.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

Victoria adopted the <a>Torrens system</a> of land registration with the <i>Real Property Act 1862</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> The Torrens system did not replace the common law system but applied only to new land grants and to land that has been voluntarily registered under the Act, and its successors.

<p>
Mining in Victoria contributes around A$6 billion to the gross state product (~2%) but employs less than 1% of workers. The Victorian mining industry is concentrated on energy producing minerals, with <a>brown coal</a>, petroleum and <a>gas</a> accounting for nearly 90% of local production. The oil and gas industries are centred off the coast of <a>Gippsland</a> in the state's east, while brown coal mining and power generation is based in the <a>Latrobe Valley</a>.

</p>
<p>
In the 2005–06 fiscal year, the average gas production was over 700 million cubic feet (20,000,000 m<sup>3</sup>) per day (M cuft/d) and represented 18% of the total national gas sales, with demand growing at 2% per year.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1985, oil production from the offshore Gippsland Basin peaked to an annual average of 450,000 barrels (72,000 m<sup>3</sup>) per day. In 2005–2006, the average daily oil production has declined to 83,000 bbl (13,200 m<sup>3</sup>)/d, but despite the decline Victoria still produces almost 19.5% of crude oil in Australia.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Brown coal</a> is Victoria's leading mineral, with 66 million tonnes mined each year for electricity generation in the Latrobe Valley, Gippsland.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> The region is home to the world's largest known reserves of brown coal.

</p>
<p>
Despite being the historic centre of Australia's gold rush, Victoria today contributes a mere 1% of national gold production. Victoria also produces limited amounts of <a>gypsum</a> and <a>kaolin</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Service_industry">Service industry</h3>
<p>
The service industries sector is the fastest growing component of the Victorian economy. It includes the wide range of activities generally classified as financial and professional services; health care and social assistance, education, transportation, IT and communication services, government services and wholesale and retail trade. Most service industries are located in Melbourne and the state's larger regional centres.

</p>
<p>
As of 2015–16, service industries employed over three-quarters of Victorian workers and more than three-quarters of the state's GSP. Finance and insurance as a group provide more value-add to the economy than any other economic activity in Victoria while health care and social assistance employ the most workers.

<p>
Victoria has the highest population density in any state in Australia, with population centres spread out over most of the state; only the far northwest and the <a>Victorian Alps</a> lack permanent settlement.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Victorian road network</a> services the population centres, with highways generally radiating from Melbourne and other major cities and rural centres with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other. Many of the highways are built to freeway standard ("M" freeways), while most are generally sealed and of reasonable quality.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/D2.5007_%2B_C2.5111_bourke.JPG/230px-D2.5007_%2B_C2.5111_bourke.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
<a>Rail transport in Victoria</a> is provided by several private and public railway operators who operate over government-owned lines. Major operators include: <a>Metro Trains Melbourne</a> which runs an extensive, electrified, passenger system throughout Melbourne and suburbs; <a>V/Line</a> which is now owned by the Victorian Government, operates a concentrated service to major regional centres, as well as long-distance services on other lines; <a>Pacific National</a>, <a>CFCL Australia</a> which operate freight services; <a>Great Southern Rail</a> which operates <i><a>The Overland</a></i> Melbourne—Adelaide; and <a>NSW TrainLink</a> which operates <a>XPTs</a> Melbourne—Sydney.

</p>
<p>
There are also several smaller freight operators and numerous tourist railways operating over lines which were once parts of a state-owned system. Victorian lines mainly use the 1,600 mm (5 ft 3 in) <a>broad gauge</a>. However, the interstate trunk routes, as well as a number of freight lines in the north and west of the state have been converted to 1,435 mm (4 ft <span>8<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>2</span></span> in) <a>standard gauge</a>. Two tourist railways operate over 760 mm (2 ft 6 in) <a>narrow gauge</a> lines, which are the remnants of five formerly government-owned lines which were built in mountainous areas.

</p>
<p>
Melbourne has the world's largest <a>tram network</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> currently operated by <a>Yarra Trams</a>. As well as being a popular form of public transport, over the last few decades trams have become one of Melbourne's major tourist attractions. There are also tourist trams operating over portions of the former <a>Ballarat</a> and Bendigo systems. There are also tramway museums at <a>Bylands</a> and Haddon.

</p>
<p>
<a>Melbourne Airport</a> is the major domestic and international gateway for the state. <a>Avalon Airport</a> is the state's second busiest airport, which complements <a>Essendon</a> and <a>Moorabbin Airports</a> to see the remainder of Melbourne's air traffic. <a>Hamilton Airport</a>, <a>Mildura Airport</a>, <a>Mount Hotham</a> and <a>Portland Airport</a> are the remaining airports with scheduled domestic flights. There are no fewer than 27 <a>other airports</a> in the state with no scheduled flights.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Port of Melbourne</a> is the largest port for containerised and general cargo in Australia,<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> and is located in Melbourne on the mouth of the <a>Yarra River</a>, which is at the head of <a>Port Phillip</a>. Additional seaports are at <a>Westernport</a>, <a>Geelong</a>, and <a>Portland</a>.

</p>
<p>
As of October 2013, smoking tobacco is prohibited in the sheltered areas of train stations, and tram and bus stops—between 2012 and 2013, 2002 people were issued with infringement notices. The state government announced a plan in October 2013 to prohibit smoking on all Victorian railway station platforms and raised tram stops.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>

Victoria's major utilities include a collection of brown-coal-fired power stations, particularly in the Latrobe Valley. One of these was the recently decommissioned <a>Hazelwood Power Station</a>, which was number 1 on the worldwide <a>List of least carbon efficient power stations</a>. The Victorian government is aiming to cut 40.6 mega tonnes of greenhouse gases emissions by 2025.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup>

<p>
Victoria's water infrastructure includes a series of dams and reservoirs, predominantly in Central Victoria, that hold and collect water for much of the state. The water collected is of a very high quality and requires little chlorination treatment, giving the water a taste more like water collected in a rainwater tank. In regional areas however, such as in the west of the state, chlorination levels are much higher.

</p>
<p>
The Victorian Water Grid consists of a number of new connections and pipelines being built across the State. This allows water to be moved around Victoria to where it is needed most and reduces the impact of localised droughts in an era thought to be influenced by climate change. Major projects already completed as part of the Grid include the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline and the Goldfields Superpipe.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>
