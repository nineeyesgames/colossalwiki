<b>Beirut</b> is the <a>capital</a> and largest city of <a>Lebanon</a>. As of 2014<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, <a>Greater Beirut</a> has a population of 2.2 million,<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> which makes it the <a>third-largest city</a> in the <a>Levant</a> region. The city is situated on a peninsula at the midpoint of Lebanon's <a>Mediterranean</a> coast. Beirut has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years, and was one of <a>Phoenicia</a>'s most prominent city states, making it one of the <a>oldest cities</a> in the world. The first historical mention of Beirut is found in the <a>Amarna letters</a> from the <a>New Kingdom of Egypt</a>, which date to the 15th century BC.

</p>
<p>
Beirut is Lebanon's <a>seat of government</a> and plays a central role in the <a>Lebanese economy</a>, with many banks and corporations based in the city. Beirut is an important <a>seaport</a> for the country and region, and rated a <a>Beta + World City</a> by the <a>Globalization and World Cities Research Network</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> Beirut was severely damaged by the <a>Lebanese Civil War</a> and the <a>massive explosion in the Port of Beirut</a>. Its cultural landscape underwent major reconstruction.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>English</a> name Beirut is an early transcription of the <a>Arabic</a> name <i>Bayrūt</i> (<span>بيروت</span>). The same name's transcription into <a>French</a> is <i>Beyrouth</i>, which was sometimes used during <a>Lebanon's French occupation</a>. The Arabic name derives from <a>Phoenician</a><i>bē'rūt</i>  (<span>𐤁𐤀‏𐤓𐤕‎</span><i>b'rt</i> ). This was a modification of the <a>Canaanite</a> and Phoenician word <i>bī'rōt</i>, meaning "<a>wells</a>", in reference to the site's accessible <a>water table</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> The name is first attested in the 14th<span></span>century<span></span>BC, when it was mentioned in three <a>Akkadian</a><a>cuneiform</a><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>  tablets of the <a>Amarna letters</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> letters sent by <a>King Ammunira</a> of <i>Biruta</i><sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> to <span><a>Amenhotep III</a></span> or <span><a>Amenhotep IV</a></span> of <a>Egypt</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><i>Biruta</i>  was also mentioned in the Amarna letters from <a>King Rib-Hadda</a> of <a>Byblos</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Greeks</a><a>hellenised</a>  the name as <i>Bērytós</i> (<a>Ancient Greek</a>: <span>Βηρυτός</span>), which the <a>Romans</a><a>latinised</a>  as <span><b>Berytus</b></span>.<sup><a href="#ref_a">[a]</a></sup> When it attained the status of a <a>Roman colony</a>, it was notionally refounded and its official name was emended to <i>Colonia Iulia Augusta Felix Berytus</i> to include its imperial sponsors.

</p>
<p>
At the time of the <a>crusades</a>, the city was known in French as <b>Barut</b> or <b>Baruth</b>.

<h3 id="Prehistory">Prehistory</h3>
<p>
Beirut was settled more than 5,000 years ago<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> and the area had been inhabited for far longer. Several <a>prehistoric</a> archaeological sites have been discovered within the urban area of Beirut, revealing flint tools of sequential periods dating from the <a>Middle Palaeolithic</a> and <a>Upper Paleolithic</a> through the <a>Neolithic</a> to the <a>Bronze Age</a>.

</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>I (<i>Minet el-Hosn</i>) was listed as "the town of Beirut" (<a>French</a>: <i>Beyrouth ville</i>) by <a>Louis Burkhalter</a> and said to be on the beach near the Orient and Bassoul hotels on the <a>Avenue des Français</a> in central Beirut.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> The site was discovered by Lortet in 1894 and discussed by <a>Godefroy Zumoffen</a> in 1900.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> The <a>flint</a><a>industry</a>  from the site was described as <a>Mousterian</a> and is held by the <a>Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>II (<i>Umm el-Khatib</i>) was suggested by Burkhalter to have been south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues discovered a <a>Copper Age</a> flint industry at around 100 metres (328 feet) <a>above sea level</a>. The site had been built on and destroyed by 1948.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>III (<i>Furn esh-Shebbak</i>), listed as <i>Plateau Tabet</i>, was suggested to have been located on the left bank of the <a>Beirut River</a>. Burkhalter suggested that it was west of the Damascus road, although this determination has been criticised by <a>Lorraine Copeland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> P. E. Gigues discovered a series of <a>Neolithic</a><a>flint tools</a>  on the surface along with the remains of a structure suggested to be a <a>hut circle</a>. <a>Auguste Bergy</a> discussed polished <a>axes</a> that were also found at this site, which has now completely disappeared as a result of construction and urbanisation of the area.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>IV (<i>Furn esh-Shebbak</i>, river banks) was also on the left bank of the river and on either side of the road leading eastwards from the Furn esh Shebbak police station towards the river that marked the city limits. The area was covered in red <a>sand</a> that represented <a>Quaternary</a><a>river terraces</a> . The site was found by <a>Jesuit</a> Father Dillenseger and published by fellow Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><a>Raoul Describes</a><sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>  and Auguste Bergy.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Collections from the site were made by Bergy, Describes and another Jesuit, <a>Paul Bovier-Lapierre</a>. Many <a>Middle Paleolithic</a> flint tools were found on the surface and in side <a>gullies</a> that drain into the river. They included around 50 varied <a>bifaces</a> accredited to the <a>Acheulean period</a>, some with a <a>lustrous sheen</a>, now held at the <a>Museum of Lebanese Prehistory</a>. <a>Henri Fleisch</a> also found an <a>Emireh point</a> amongst material from the site, which has now disappeared beneath buildings.

</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>V (<i>Nahr Beirut</i>, <a>Beirut River</a>) was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an <a>orchard</a> of <a>mulberry</a> trees on the left bank of the river, near the <a>river mouth</a>, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to <a>Tripoli</a>. <a>Levallois flints</a> and bones and similar surface material were found amongst <a>brecciated deposits</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> The area has now been built on.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>VI (Patriarchate) was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled <a>Canaanean blade</a><a>javelin</a>  suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of <a>Byblos</a> and which is held in the school library.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut<span></span>VII, the Rivoli Cinema and Byblos Cinema sites near the Bourj in the Rue el Arz area, are two sites discovered by Lorraine Copeland and <a>Peter Wescombe</a> in 1964 and examined by <a>Diana Kirkbride</a> and Roger Saidah. One site was behind the parking lot of the Byblos Cinema and showed collapsed walls, pits, floors, charcoal, pottery and flints. The other, overlooking a cliff west of the Rivoli Cinema, was composed of three layers resting on <a>limestone</a> bedrock. Fragments of blades and broad flakes were recovered from the first layer of black soil, above which some Bronze Age pottery was recovered in a layer of grey soil. Pieces of <a>Roman</a> pottery and <a>mosaics</a> were found in the upper layer.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Middle Bronze Age tombs were found in this area, and the ancient <a>tell</a> of Beirut is thought to be in the Bourj area.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>

The earliest settlement of Beirut was on an island in the Beirut River, but the channel that separated it from the banks silted up and the island ceased to be. Excavations in the downtown area have unearthed layers of Phoenician, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Crusader, and <a>Ottoman</a> remains.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_port_of_Beirut">Phoenician port of Beirut</a></div>
<p>
The <a>Phoenician port of Beirut</a> was located between Rue Foch and Rue Allenby on the north coast. The port or <a>harbour</a> was excavated and reported on several years ago and now lies buried under the city.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> Another suggested port or dry dock was claimed to have been discovered around 1 kilometre (0.62 miles) to the west in 2011 by a team of Lebanese <a>archaeologists</a> from the <a>Directorate General of Antiquities</a> of <a>Lebanese University</a>. Controversy arose on 26 June 2012 when authorisation was given by Lebanese <a>Minister of Culture</a><a>Gaby Layoun</a>  for a private company called Venus Towers Real Estate Development Company to destroy the ruins (archaeological site BEY194) in the $500 million construction project of three skyscrapers and a garden behind Hotel Monroe in downtown Beirut. Two later reports by an international committee of archaeologists appointed by Layoun, including Hanz Curver, and an expert report by Ralph Pederson, a member of the institute of Nautical Archaeology and now teaching in <a>Marburg</a>, Germany, dismissed the claims that the trenches were a port, on various criteria. The exact function of site BEY194 may never be known, and the issue raised heated emotions and led to increased coverage on the subject of Lebanese heritage in the press.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Hellenistic_period">Hellenistic period</h3>
<p>
In 140<span></span>BC, the Phoenician city was destroyed by <a>Diodotus Tryphon</a> in his conflict with <a>Antiochus VII Sidetes</a> for the throne of the <a>Hellenistic</a><a>Seleucid</a>  monarchy. Laodicea in Phoenicia was built upon the same site on a more conventional Hellenistic plan. Present-day Beirut overlies this ancient one, and little archaeology was carried out until after the <a>civil war</a> 1991. The salvage excavations after 1993 have yielded new insights into the layout and history of this period of Beirut's history. Public architecture included several areas and buildings.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>

<p>
Mid-1st-century coins from Berytus bear the head of <a>Tyche</a>, goddess of fortune;<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> on the reverse, the city's symbol appears: a dolphin entwines an <a>anchor</a>. This symbol was later taken up by the early printer <a>Aldus Manutius</a> in 15th century <a>Venice</a>. After a state of civil war and decline the Seleucid Empire faced, King <a>Tigranes the Great</a> of the <a>Kingdom of Armenia</a> conquered Beirut and placed it under effective Armenian control. However, after the <a>Battle of Tigranocerta</a>, Armenia forever lost their holdings in Syria and Beirut was conquered by Roman general <a>Pompey</a>.

<p>
Laodicea was conquered by <a>Pompey</a> in 64 BC and the name Berytus was restored to it. The city was assimilated into the <a>Roman Empire</a>, soldiers were sent there, and large building projects were undertaken.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> From the 1st century BC, the <a>Bekaa Valley</a> served as a source of grain for the <a>Roman provinces</a> of the <a>Levant</a> and even for <a>Rome</a> itself. Under <a>Claudius</a>, Berytus expanded to reach the Bekaa Valley and include <a>Heliopolis (Baalbek)</a>. The city was settled by Roman colonists who promoted agriculture in the region.

</p>
<p>
As a result of this settlement, the city quickly became <a>Romanized</a>, and the city became the only mainly <a>Latin-speaking</a> area in the <a>Syria-Phoenicia province</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> In 14<span></span>BC, during the reign of <a>Herod the Great</a>, Berytus became a <a>colony</a>, one of four in the <a>Syria-Phoenicia region</a> and the only one with full Italian rights (<i><i>ius Italicum</i></i>) exempting its citizens from imperial taxation. Beirut was considered the most Roman city in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> Furthermore, the veterans of two <a>Roman legions</a> were established in the city of Berytus by emperor <a>Augustus</a>: the <a>5th Macedonian</a> and the <a>3rd Gallic Legions</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Berytus's <a>law school</a> was widely known;<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> two of Rome's most famous jurists, <a>Papinian</a> and <a>Ulpian</a>, were natives of <a>Phoenicia</a> and taught there under the <a>Severan</a> emperors. When <a>Justinian</a> assembled his <i><a>Pandects</a></i> in the 6th century, a large part of the corpus of laws was derived from these two jurists, and in AD<span></span>533 Justinian recognised the school as one of the three official law schools of the empire.

</p>
<p>
In 551, a <a>major earthquake</a> struck Berytus,<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> causing widespread damage. The earthquake reduced cities along the coast to ruins and killed many, 30,000 in Berytus alone by some measurements.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> As a result, the students of the law school were transferred to <a>Sidon</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Salvage excavations since 1993 have yielded new insights in the layout and history of Roman Berytus. Public architecture included several <a>bath complexes</a>, <a>Colonnaded Streets</a>, a <a>circus</a> and theatre;<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> residential areas were excavated in the <a>Garden of Forgiveness</a>, <a>Martyrs' Square</a> and the Beirut Souks.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>

<p>
Beirut was <a>conquered by the Muslims</a> in 635.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> Prince Arslan bin al-Mundhir founded the Principality of <a>Sin el Fil</a> in Beirut in 759. From this principality developed the later Principality of Mount Lebanon, which was the basis for the establishment of Greater Lebanon, today's Lebanon.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> As a trading centre of the eastern <a>Mediterranean</a>, Beirut was overshadowed by <a>Acre</a> (in modern-day <a>Israel</a>) during the <a>Middle Ages</a>. From 1110 to 1291, the town and <a>Lordship of Beirut</a> was part of the <a>Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. The city was taken by <a>Saladin</a> in 1187 and recaptured in 1197 by <a>Henry I of Brabant</a> as part of the <a>German Crusade of 1197</a>. <a>John of Ibelin</a>, known as the Old Lord of Beirut, was granted the lordship of the city in 1204. He rebuilt the city after its destruction by the <a>Ayyubids</a> and also built the <a>House of Ibelin</a> palace in Beirut.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>

<p>
Under the <a>Ottoman</a> sultan <a>Selim I</a> (1512–1520), the Ottomans conquered <a>Syria</a> including present-day <a>Lebanon</a>. Beirut was controlled by local <a>Druze</a> emirs throughout the Ottoman period.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> One of them, <a>Fakhr-al-Din II</a>, fortified it early in the 17th century, but the Ottomans reclaimed it in 1763.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> With the help of <a>Damascus</a>, Beirut successfully broke Acre's monopoly on Syrian maritime trade and for a few years supplanted it as the main trading centre in the region. During the succeeding epoch of rebellion against Ottoman hegemony in Acre under <a>Jezzar Pasha</a> and <a>Abdullah Pasha</a>, Beirut declined to a small town with a population of about 10,000 and was an object of contention between the Ottomans, the local Druze, and the <a>Mamluks</a>. After <a>Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt</a> captured Acre in 1832,<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> Beirut began its revival.

<p>
By the second half of the nineteenth century, Beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with European imperial powers, particularly France. European interests in Lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. This boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the <a>Sursock family</a>, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened Beirut's position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. Meanwhile, Ottoman power in the region continued to decline. Sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the <a>1860 Lebanon conflict</a>. Beirut became a destination for <a>Maronite</a> Christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on <a>Mount Lebanon</a> and in Damascus.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> This in turn altered the religious composition of Beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater Lebanon. However, Beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. This was again a product of European intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the city's residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> After petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of <a>Syria Vilayet</a><a>Mehmed Rashid Pasha</a>  authorized the establishment of the Beirut Municipal Council,<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup> the first municipality established in the Arab provinces of the Empire.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> The council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1888, Beirut was made capital of a <a>vilayet</a> (governorate) in Syria,<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> including the <a>sanjaks</a> (prefectures) Latakia, Tripoli, Beirut, Acre and Bekaa.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> By this time, Beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with <a>Europe</a> and the United States. It also became a centre of <a>missionary</a> activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the <a>American University of Beirut</a>. Provided with water from a British company and gas from a French one, silk exports to Europe came to dominate the local economy. After French engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across Lebanon to Damascus and <a>Aleppo</a> in 1907, much of the trade was carried by French ships to <a>Marseille</a>. French influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other European power. The 1911 <i><a>Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i> reported a population consisting of 36,000 Muslims, 77,000 Christians, 2,500 Jews, 400 Druze and 4,100 foreigners.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> At the start of the 20th century, <a>Salim Ali Salam</a> was one of the most prominent figures in Beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from Beirut to the Ottoman parliament and President of the Municipality of Beirut. Given his modern way of life, the emergence of Salim Ali Salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.

After World War I and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, Beirut, along with the rest of Lebanon, was placed under the <a>French Mandate</a>. Lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and Beirut became the capital city. The city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven,<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> especially for the <a>Persian Gulf</a> oil boom.

</p>
<p>
This era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the <a>Lebanese Civil War</a> broke out throughout the country,<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> During most of the war, Beirut was divided between the Muslim west part and the Christian east.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> The downtown area, previously the home of much of the city's commercial and cultural activity, became a <a>no man's land</a> known as the <a>Green Line</a>. Many inhabitants fled to other countries. About 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war (1975–1976), and much of the city was devastated. A particularly destructive period was the 1978 Syrian siege of <a>Achrafiyeh</a>, the main Christian district of Beirut. Syrian troops relentlessly shelled the eastern quarter of the city,<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> but Christian militias defeated multiple attempts by Syria's elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the <a>Hundred Days' War</a>.

</p>
<p>
Another destructive chapter was the <a>1982 Lebanon War</a>, during which most of West Beirut was under siege by Israeli troops. In 1983, French and US <a>barracks were bombed</a>, killing 241 American servicemen, 58 French servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Since the end of the war in 1990, the people of Lebanon have been rebuilding Beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. By the start of the <a>2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict</a> the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the Middle East and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. The reconstruction of downtown Beirut has been largely driven by <a>Solidere</a>, a development company established in 1994 by Prime Minister <a>Rafic Hariri</a>. The city has hosted both the Asian Club Basketball Championship and the Asian Football Cup, and has hosted the <a>Miss Europe</a> pageant nine times: 1960–1964, 1999, 2001–2002, and 2016.

</p>
<p>
Rafic Hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the <a>Saint George Hotel</a> in Beirut.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> A month later about one million people gathered for an <a>opposition rally</a> in Beirut.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> The <a>Cedar Revolution</a> was the largest rally in Lebanon's history at that time.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup> The last Syrian troops withdrew from Beirut on 26 April 2005,<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 October 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the 2006 Lebanon War, Israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of Beirut, especially the predominantly <a>Shiite</a> southern suburbs of Beirut. On 12 July 2006, the <a>"Operation Truthful Promise"</a> carried out by <a>Hezbollah</a> ended with 8 Israeli deaths and 6 injuries. In response, the IDF targeted Hezbollah's main media outlets. There were then artillery raids against targets in southern Lebanon, and the Israeli cabinet held Beirut responsible for the attacks. Then on 13 July 2006 <a>Israel</a> began implementing a naval and air blockade over Lebanon; during this blockade Israel bombed the runways at <a>Beirut International Airport</a> and the major Beirut-Damascus highway in Eastern Lebanon.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In May 2008, after the government decided to disband Hezbollah's communications network (a decision it later rescinded), <a>violent clashes</a> broke out briefly between government allies and opposition forces, before control of the city was handed over to the <a>Lebanese Army</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> After this a national dialogue conference was held in <a>Doha</a> at the invitation of the Prince of Qatar. The conference agreed to appoint a new president of Lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. As a result of the <a>Doha Agreement</a>, the opposition's barricades were dismantled and so were the opposition's protest camps in <a>Martyrs' Square</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> On 19 October 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the Beirut's neighbourhood of <a>Achrafiyeh</a>, including Brigadier General <a>Wissam al-Hassan</a>, chief of the Intelligence Bureau of the <a>Internal Security Forces</a>. In addition, <a>78 others were wounded</a> in the bombing.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> It was the largest attack in the capital since 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> On 27 December 2013, a <a>car bomb</a><a>exploded</a>  in the <a>Central District</a> killing at least five people, including the former Lebanese ambassador to the U.S. <a>Mohamad Chatah</a>, and wounding 71 others.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the <a>12 November 2015 Beirut bombings</a>, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. The <a>Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On 4 August 2020, <a>a massive explosion in the Port of Beirut</a> resulted in the death of at least 203 people (with an additional three missing)<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> and the wounding of more than 6,500. Foreigners from at least 22 countries were among the casualties. Furthermore, at least 108 <a>Bangladeshis</a> were injured in the blasts, making them the most affected foreign community. The cause of the blast is believed to be from government-confiscated and stored <a>ammonium nitrate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> As many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> Protesters in Lebanon called on the government on 8 August 2020 for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the 4 August explosion.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> On 10 August 2020, as a result of the protests, Prime Minister <a>Hassan Diab</a> announced his resignation.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup> Weeks later, a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the port's duty-free zone, on 10 September 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup>

<p>
Beirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the <a>Mediterranean Sea</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> It is flanked by the <a>Lebanon Mountains</a> and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: Al-<a>Ashrafieh</a> and Al-Musaytibah. The Beirut Governorate occupies 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), and the city's <a>metropolitan area</a> 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi).<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> The coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.

</p>
<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<p>
Beirut has a <a>hot-summer Mediterranean climate</a> (<a>Köppen</a>: Csa) characterised by mild days and nights, as its coastal location allows temperatures to be <a>moderated by the sea</a>. Autumn and spring are warm, but short. Winter is mild and rainy. Summer is prolonged, hot and muggy. The prevailing wind during the afternoon and evening is from the west (onshore, blowing in from the Mediterranean); at night it reverses to offshore, blowing from the land out to sea.

</p>
<p>
The average annual rainfall is 825 millimetres (32.5 in), with the large majority of it falling from October to April. Much of the autumn and spring rain falls in heavy downpours on a limited number of days, but in winter it is spread more evenly over many days. Summer receives very little rainfall, if any. Snow is rare, except in the mountainous eastern suburbs, where snowfall occurs due to the region's high altitudes. <a>Hail</a> (which can often be heavy) occurs a few times per year, mostly during winter.

<p>
Lebanon, especially Beirut and its suburbs, suffered a massive garbage crisis, mainly from July 2015 up to March 2016. The issue began when authorities shut down the main landfill site originally used for Beirut's garbage south-east of the city and failed to provide any alternative solutions for months. As a result, garbage mounted in the streets in Greater Beirut and caused protests to erupt, which sometimes invoked police action. This problem was commonly blamed on the country's political situation. This garbage crisis birthed a movement called "<a>You Stink</a>" which was directed at the country's politicians. In March 2016, the government finally came up with a so-called temporary solution to establish two new landfills East and South of the city to store the garbage, while several municipalities across the country, in an unprecedented move, began recycling and managing waste more efficiently, building waste-management facilities and relying on themselves rather than the central government. Moreover, Beirut has a lack of green areas with just two main public gardens (sanayeh and horch Beirut). In fact, concrete roofs cover 80% of the capital area.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup>

<p>
These quarters are divided into 59 sectors (<i>secteurs</i>).<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Badaro</a> is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>, within the green district of Beirut (<i>secteur du parc</i>) which also include the <a>Beirut Hippodrome</a> and the <a>Beirut Pine Forest</a> and the French ambassador's <a>Pine Residence</a>. It is one of Beirut's favourite hip nightlife destination.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Two of the twelve official <a>Palestinian refugee camps</a> in Lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of Beirut: Bourj el-Barajneh and <a>Shatila</a>. There is also one within its municipal boundaries: <a>Mar Elias</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Southern suburban districts include Chiyah, <a>Ghobeiry</a> (Bir Hassan, Jnah and Ouzai are part of the Ghobeiry municipality), Haret Hreik, Burj al Barajneh, Laylake-Mreijeh, Hay al Sillum and Hadath. Eastern suburbs include Burj Hammoud, Sin el Fil, Dekwane and Mkalles. Hazmiyeh is also considered as an eastern suburb with its close proximity to the capital.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> Of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, Sabra, which lies adjacent to Shatila, is also located in southern Beirut<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> and was the scene of <a>a massacre</a> during the civil war.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
People in Lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. Instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more commonly used.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Beirut is one of the most <a>cosmopolitan</a> and religiously diverse cities of Lebanon and all of the Middle East.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup> The city boasts significant <a>Muslim</a> and <a>Christian</a> communities. In Beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup> At the end of the civil war the Copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. The original seventeen included three <a>Muslim</a> sects: <a>Shi'a</a>, <a>Sunni</a>, and <a>'Alawi</a>; one <a>Druze</a> sect; Twelve <a>Christian</a> sects: <a>Maronite Catholics</a>, <a>Greek Orthodox</a>, <a>Melkite Catholics</a>, <a>Protestant Evangelicals</a>, and other Christian denominations non-native to Lebanon like <a>Armenian Orthodox</a>, <a>Armenian Catholics</a>, Assyrians (<a>Syriac Orthodox</a>, <a>Syriac Catholic</a>, <a>Church of the East</a>, <a>Chaldean Catholic</a>), <a>Copts</a>; and <a>Jews</a> (very few remain in Lebanon today, but children of Lebanese Jewish parents may register as citizens at Lebanese Embassies.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup>) Briefly, Christians are 35% of Beirut, Muslims 63%, 1% Druze, 1% others.

<p>
Family matters such as marriage, divorce and inheritance are still handled by the religious authorities representing a person's faith (the Ottoman "<a>millet</a>" system). Calls for <a>civil marriage</a> are unanimously rejected by the religious authorities, but civil marriages held in another country are recognised by Lebanese <a>civil authorities</a>.

</p>
<p>
Before the civil war the neighbourhoods of Beirut were fairly heterogeneous, but they became largely segregated by religion since the conflict.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> East Beirut has a mainly Christian population with a small Muslim minority, while West Beirut has a Sunni Muslim majority with small minorities of Shia, Christians and Druze. Since the end of the civil war, East and West Beirut have begun to see an increase in Muslims and Christians moving into each half. The southern suburbs are populated largely by <a>Shia Muslims</a>, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely Christian.

</p>
<p>
The city is also home to a small number of <a>Latin Rite Roman Catholics</a> in the form of an <a>apostolic vicariate</a> with Archbishop <a>Paul Dahdah</a>, <a>OCD</a>, as the apostolic vicar.

The Beirut Central District (BCD) or <i>Centre Ville</i> is the name given to Beirut's historical and geographical core by "Solidere", the "vibrant financial, commercial, and administrative hub of the country."<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> It is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. Its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup> Due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the <a>Lebanese Civil War</a>, the Beirut Central District underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. Ever since, <a>Beirut Central District</a> has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. That evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup>

<p>
Assessment of the demand for build-up space in the BCD has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as Souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> The district's total area is 4,690,000 square metres (50,482,740 square feet), the majority of which is dedicated to residential space (1,924,000 square metres or 20,709,764 square feet).<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup> The <a>Beirut Central District</a> contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. These spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres (39 ha) of open spaces.

</p>
<p>
The central district is Lebanon's prime location for shopping, entertainment, and dining. There are over 100 cafes, restaurants, pubs and nightclubs open in the <a>Beirut Central District</a>, and over 350 retail outlets distributed along its streets and quarters. <a>Beirut Souks</a> alone are home to over 200 stores and a handful of restaurants and cafes. Beirut Souks are the <a>Central District</a>'s old <a>medieval</a> market, recently renovated along with the original Hellenistic street grid that characterised the old souks and the area's historical landmarks along long vaulted shopping alleys and arcades.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup><a>Solidere</a> , the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the <a>Beirut Marathon</a>, <a>Fête de la Musique</a>, Beirut Jazz Festival.

</p>
<p>
However, the means of urban development in this particular area of the city was subject to much criticism and controversy. Rafic Hariri, who would later become prime minister, was the majority stakeholder of the company, which raises concerns of conflict of interest in the context of a public-private partnership.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> Many of the expropriations that have made the project possible have been made at undervalued land rates, and partly paid in company share. Strict urbanisation laws were put in order to oblige people to sell and not renovate themselves.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> Today, Solidere acts as a de facto municipality, thus this quarter of the city is effectively privatised. It is for example forbidden to ride bikes on Zeituna Bay, a marina where many restaurants are located, and these laws are enforced by private security guards not national or municipal police.

</p>
<p>
The project was also criticised for destroying some of the city's architectural and cultural heritage. "Among the hundreds of destroyed buildings were "the last Ottoman and medieval remains in Beirut" wrote American University of Beirut professor Nabil Beyhum in the <i>Journal The Beirut Review</i> in 1992. Much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down "some of the capital's most significant buildings and structures," wrote UCLA professor Saree Makdisi in the journal, Critical Inquiry, in 1997.".<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup> Moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the Beirut Downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. And most of public spaces promised by Solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as "The Garden of Forgiveness", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today,<sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup> putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Finally, the actual success of the project has recently<sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup> been in doubt, given that large quarters of the BCD are today empty, due to strong military presence, the Nejmeh Square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.<sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup>

<p>
Beirut's economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.

</p>
<p>
In an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the Lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> With its seaport and airport—coupled with Lebanon's free economic and foreign exchange system, solid gold-backed currency, banking-secrecy law, and favourable interest rates—Beirut became an established banking centre for Arab wealth, much of which was invested in construction, commercial enterprise, and industry (mostly the manufacture of textiles and shoes, food processing, and printing).<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> The economy of Beirut is diverse, including publishing, banking, trade and various industries. During that period, Beirut was the region's financial services center. At the onset of the oil boom starting in the 1960s, Lebanon-based banks were the main recipients of the region's petrodollars.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup>

<p>
Beirut is the focal point of the <a>Economy of Lebanon</a>. The capital hosts the headquarters of <a>Banque du Liban</a>, Lebanon's <a>central bank</a>, the <a>Beirut Stock Exchange</a>, the head office of Lebanon's flag-carrier <a>Middle East Airlines</a>, the <a>United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia</a>, the <a>Union of Arab Banks</a>, and the Union of Arab Stock Exchanges.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup>

<p>
The Banking System is the backbone of the local economy with a balance sheet of $152 billion at the end of 2012, nearing 3.5 times the GDP estimated at $43 billion by the <a>IMF</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> Bank deposits also increased in 2012 by 8% to 125 billion dollars, 82 percent of the sector's assets. "Banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in Europe and the United States", says Marwan Mikhael, head of research at <a>BLOM Bank</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut's foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5 billion in 2011 and analysts say that the Central Bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the Lebanese currency in the market. This means that the Central Bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves. <sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of Beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the Lebanese economy. The passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the "secret of the profession". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>

<p>
The tourism industry in Beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and Lebanon in general. Before the <a>Lebanese Civil War</a>, Beirut was widely regarded as the "Paris of the Middle East,"<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup> often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the <a>Levantine</a> Mediterranean culture. Beirut's diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. However, in recent times, certain countries, such as the United States, have frequently placed Lebanon, and Beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup>

<p>
According to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in Beirut came from states within the <a>Arab League</a>, 33% came from European countries (mainly France, Germany, and Britain), and 16% from the <a>Americas</a> (about half of which are from the United States).<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The largely pedestrianised <a>Beirut Central District</a> is the core of the Beirut tourism scene. The district is a cluster of stone-façade buildings lining arcaded streets and radial alleyways. The architecture of the area is a mix of French Architecture and <a>Venetian Gothic architecture</a> mixed with <a>Arabesque</a> and <a>Ottoman Architecture</a>. The district contains numerous old mosques and crusader churches, as well as uncovered remnants and ruins of the <a>Roman</a> era. The District contains dozens of restaurants, cafes and pubs, as well as a wide range of shopping stores mainly in <a>Beirut Souks</a>. High-rise hotels and towers line the district's New Waterfront, marina and seaside promenade.

</p>
<p>
Another popular tourist destination in Beirut is the <a>Corniche Beirut</a>, a 4.8 km (3 mi) pedestrian promenade that encircles the capital's seafront from the <a>Saint George Bay</a> in the north all the way to <a>Avenue de Paris</a> and <a>Avenue General de Gaulle</a> south of the city. The corniche reaches its maximum height <a>above sea level</a> at <a>Raouché</a>, a high-rise residential neighbourhood rising over a giant white limestone cliff and facing the recognisable off-shore Raouché Rocks.

</p>
<p>
<a>Badaro</a> is one of Beirut's most appealing neighbourhoods, a lovely place to stroll during daytime and a destination for going out in the evening. Badaro is within Beirut's green district with a 75-acre (30-hectare) public park (The Beirut Pine forest) and a 50-acre (20-hectare) hippodrome. It is a neighbourhood on a very human scale with small groceries around every corner. The neighbourhood residents, a mix of old impoverished Christian bourgeoisie, bohemian style people in their 30s and well-established urban professionals, are loyal to local bakery and pastry shops. Because of the blossoming café and bar scene it has become lately a hip destination for Beirut's young and restless but old Beirutis remember that Badaro was already Beirut's version of the Village in the swinging sixties.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Groceries and eateries can be found on almost every street of the area.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> There are dozens of restaurants, pubs and footpath cafés of virtually every style.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Badaro "Village" thrives on local residents, day-trippers and hipsters from all over Beirut, office employees and many expatriates.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Hamra Street</a> is a long cobblestone street connecting the <a>Beirut Central District</a> with the coastal <a>Raouche</a> area. The street is a large concentration of shopping stores, boutiques, restaurants, banks, street vendors, footpath cafes, newspaper kiosks, and a booming nightlife spurred by students from the neighbouring <a>American University of Beirut</a>. The AUB campus is another popular visitor destination, composed of a cluster of 19th century red-roofed buildings dispersed on a wooded hillside overlooking the <a>Mediterranean</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Gemmayzeh</a> is Beirut's artistic <a>bohemian</a> quarter, full of narrow streets and historic buildings from the <a>French era</a>. It is located East of the <a>Beirut Central District</a>, bordering the <a>Saifi Village</a>. The neighborhood is well known for its trendy bars and pubs, cafes, restaurants and lounges; most are directly located on <a>Rue Gouraud</a>, the main thoroughfare that cuts through the middle of the district. <a>Travel + Leisure</a> magazine called Gemmayzeh "SoHo by the Sea," due to its colorful and chic cafés amid 1950s apartment buildings and hole-in-the-wall shops.<sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup> However, Gemmayzeh received the most damage by the Beirut explosion in 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_125">[125]</a></sup>

<p>
Beirut is a destination for tourists from both the Arab world and West.<sup><a href="#ref_126">[126]</a></sup> In <i><a>Travel + Leisure</a></i> magazine's World Best Awards 2006, it was ranked the 9th best city in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup> That list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 Lebanon War broke out, but in 2008 <i>The Guardian</i> listed Beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup><i>The New York Times</i>  ranked it at number one on its "44 places to go" list of 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_129">[129]</a></sup> 2011 MasterCard Index revealed that Beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the <a>Middle East</a> and <a>Africa</a>, totalling $6.5 billion.<sup><a href="#ref_130">[130]</a></sup> Beirut was chosen in 2012 by <a>Condé Nast Traveller</a> as the best city in the <a>Middle East</a>, beating <a>Tel Aviv</a> and <a>Dubai</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_131">[131]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Many of the tourists are returning Lebanese expatriates, but many are from Western countries. Approximately 3 million visitors visited in 2010; the previous record was 1.4 million in 1974.<sup><a href="#ref_132">[132]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Like other forms of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon is on the rise recently. Although visitors from neighbouring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more Southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organised, quality medical destination.<sup><a href="#ref_133">[133]</a></sup> Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process as easy as possible.<sup><a href="#ref_134">[134]</a></sup>
Cosmetic surgery is a major component of medical tourism in Lebanon. Most of the foreign patients come for routine operations like plastic surgery, dental or eye surgery, and Beirut's hospitals are also capable of performing specialised procedures such as internal bypass surgery and other technical treatments. Its top clinics and hospitals like Sahel General are equipped to handle the full range of surgical procedures. Beirut-based Clemenceau Medical Center (CMC), affiliated with Johns Hopkins International, was ranked one of the world's top ten best hospitals for medical tourism in 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_135">[135]</a></sup>

The city's renovated airport is the <a>Rafic Hariri International Airport</a>, located in the southern suburbs. The <a>Port of Beirut</a>, one of the largest and most commercial in the eastern Mediterranean, is another port of entry. As a final destination, Lebanon can be reached by road from Damascus via the Beqaa valley in the east.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Beirut has frequent bus connections to other cities in Lebanon and major <a>cities in Syria</a> such as Homs and its capital Damascus. There are a number of different companies providing public transport in Lebanon. The publicly owned buses are managed by <a>Office des Chemins de Fer et des Transports en Commun</a> (OCFTC – "Railway and Public Transportation Authority"). Buses for northern destinations and Syria leave from Charles Helou Station.<sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The ministry of transport and public works purchased an extra 250 intra and inter-buses in 2012 to better serve regions outside the capital as well as congestion-choked Beirut, hoping to lessen the use of private cars.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>

It has about 1,300 exhibits ranging in date from <a>prehistoric times</a> to the <a>medieval Mamluk period</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup> The <a>Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut</a> is the third oldest museum in the Middle East, exhibiting a wide range of artefacts from Lebanon and neighbouring countries.<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup><a>Sursock Museum</a>  was built by the illustrious <a>Sursock family</a> at the end of the 19th century as a private villa for <a>Nicolas Sursock</a>, and then donated to the Lebanese state upon his death. It now houses Beirut's most influential and popular art museum. The permanent collection shows a set of Japanese engravings, numerous works of <a>Islamic art</a> and classic Italian paintings, while temporary exhibitions are also shown throughout the year. The <a>Robert Mouawad Private Museum</a> near Beirut's <a>Grand Serail</a> exhibits <a>Henri Pharaon's</a> private collection of archaeology and antiques.<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup>

In October 2013, <a>Mim Museum</a>, a private <a>mineral</a> museum, opened its doors to the public. It has on display some 2000 minerals from more than 70 countries. Mim museum's collection is considered to be one of the world's paramount private collection for the variety and quality of its minerals.<sup><a href="#ref_168">[168]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_169">[169]</a></sup> A didactic circuit, accompanied by screens showing films and scientific applications of mineralogy, will reveal a world of unsuspected marvels—priceless both from an aesthetic and scientific point of view. <i>Mimodactylus libanensis</i> "mimo", the fossil of a pterodactyl is featured in a special wing. This one-of-a-kind complete specimen in the Middle-East was found in Lebanon. It is promoted by means of state-of-the-art modern techniques: a hologram, an auto-stereoscopic movie, a full-scale reconstitution and a game "fly with mimo" – an entertainment that delights children and adults. Moreover, Mim hosts a thematic exhibition of 200 marine fossils. "Fish’n’Stone" was organised with the collaboration of Mémoire du Temps. Known throughout the world, those fossils were quarried in the Lebanese mountains. The history of the fossil formation is shown through an animation that submerses you in the marine life – a time capsule that takes you in a journey to some 100 million of years ago.
