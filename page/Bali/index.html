<b>Bali</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˈ</span><span>b</span><span>ɑː</span><span>l</span><span>i</span></span>/</a></span></span>; <a>Balinese</a>: <span><span>ᬩᬮᬶ</span></span>) is a province of <a>Indonesia</a> and the westernmost of the <a>Lesser Sunda Islands</a>. East of <a>Java</a> and west of <a>Lombok</a>, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably <a>Nusa Penida</a>, <a>Nusa Lembongan</a>, and <a>Nusa Ceningan</a>. The provincial capital, <a>Denpasar</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> is the <a>most populous city</a> in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after <a>Makassar</a>, in <a>Eastern Indonesia</a>. The upland town of <a>Ubud</a> in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Bali is the only <a>Hindu-majority province</a> in <a>Muslim-majority</a> Indonesia, with 86.9% of the population adhering to <a>Balinese Hinduism</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events held in Bali include the <a>Miss World 2013</a> and 2018 <a>Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group</a>. In March 2017, <a>TripAdvisor</a> named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in January 2021.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Bali is part of the <a>Coral Triangle</a>, the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire <a>Caribbean</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> Bali is the home of the <a>Subak irrigation system</a>, a <a>UNESCO</a><a>World Heritage Site</a> .<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the <a>Bali Kingdom</a>. The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before <a>Dutch colonisation</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Bali_panorama.jpg/220px-Bali_panorama.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Bali was inhabited around 2000 BCE by <a>Austronesian people</a> who migrated originally from the island of Taiwan to Southeast Asia and <a>Oceania</a> through <a>Maritime Southeast Asia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia, the Philippines and Oceania.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, namely <a>Pasupata</a>, <a>Bhairawa</a>, <a>Siwa Shidanta</a>, <a>Vaishnava</a>, <a>Bodha</a>, <a>Brahma</a>, <a>Resi</a>, <a>Sora</a> and <a>Ganapatya</a>. Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned. They also reveal an independent Bali, with a distinct dialect, where <a>Buddhism</a> and <a>Shaivism</a> were practised simultaneously. <a>Mpu Sindok</a>'s great-granddaughter, <a>Mahendradatta</a> (Gunapriyadharmapatni), married the Bali king <a>Udayana Warmadewa</a> (Dharmodayanavarmadeva) around 989, giving birth to <a>Airlangga</a> around 1001. This marriage also brought more <a>Hinduism</a> and Javanese culture to Bali. Princess Sakalendukirana appeared in 1098. Suradhipa reigned from 1115 to 1119, and Jayasakti from 1146 until 1150. Jayapangus appears on inscriptions between 1178 and 1181, while Adikuntiketana and his son Paramesvara in 1204.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup><sup><span>: 129, 144, 168, 180 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
Balinese culture was strongly influenced by Indian, Chinese, and particularly <a>Hindu</a> culture, beginning around the 1st century AD. The name <i>Bali dwipa</i> ("Bali island") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by <a>Sri Kesari Warmadewa</a> in 914 AD and mentioning <b>Walidwipa</b>. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system <i><a>subak</a></i> to grow rice in <a>wet-field cultivation</a>. Some religious and cultural traditions still practised today can be traced to this period.

</p>
<p>
The Hindu <a>Majapahit Empire</a> (1293–1520 AD) on eastern <a>Java</a> founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of <a>Hayam Wuruk</a> is mentioned in the charters of 1384–86. Mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the <a>Majapahit Empire</a> fell in 1520.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup><sup><span>: 234, 240 </span></sup> Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy. The nation with various kingdoms became independent for up to 386 years until 1906 when the Dutch subjugated and repulsed the natives for economic control and took it over.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Portuguese_contacts">Portuguese contacts</h3>
<p>
The first known <a>European</a> contact with Bali is thought to have been made in 1512, when a Portuguese expedition led by Antonio Abreu and <a>Francisco Serrão</a> sighted its northern shores. It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually travelled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands. Bali was also mapped in 1512, in the chart of Francisco Rodrigues, aboard the expedition.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> In 1585, a ship foundered off the <a>Bukit Peninsula</a> and left a few Portuguese in the service of <a>Dewa Agung</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>
In 1597, the Dutch explorer <a>Cornelis de Houtman</a> arrived at Bali, and the <a>Dutch East India Company</a> was established in 1602. The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century. Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast when the Dutch pitted various competing for Balinese realms against each other.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms on the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.

</p>
<p>
In June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, <a>Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at <a>Buleleng</a> on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his <a>Wallace Line</a> theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and <a>Lombok</a>. It is a boundary between species. In his travel memoir <i><a>The Malay Archipelago</a>,</i> Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has a strong mention of the <a>unique Balinese irrigation methods</a>:

</p>
<p>
The Dutch mounted large naval and ground <a>assaults at the Sanur region</a> in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (<i><a>puputan</a></i>) to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> In the <a>Dutch intervention in Bali</a>, a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in <a>Klungkung</a>. Afterwards, the Dutch governours exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and <a>Maluku</a>.

</p>
<p>
In the 1930s, anthropologists <a>Margaret Mead</a> and <a>Gregory Bateson</a>, artists <a>Miguel Covarrubias</a> and <a>Walter Spies</a>, and musicologist <a>Colin McPhee</a> all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as "an enchanted land of <a>aesthetes</a> at peace with themselves and nature". Western tourists began to visit the island.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The sensuous image of Bali was enhanced in the West by a quasi-pornographic 1932 documentary <i>Virgins of Bali</i> about a day in the lives of two teenage Balinese girls whom the film's narrator Deane Dickason notes in the first scene "bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies".<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> Under the looser version of the <a>Hays code</a> that existed up to 1934, nudity involving "civilised" (i.e. white) women was banned, but permitted with "uncivilised" (i.e. all non-white women), a loophole that was exploited by the producers of <i>Virgins of Bali</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> The film, which mostly consisted of scenes of topless Balinese women was a great success in 1932, and almost single-handedly made Bali into a popular spot for tourists.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Imperial Japan</a> occupied Bali during World War II. It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on <a>Borneo</a> were inoperative due to heavy rains, the <a>Imperial Japanese Army</a> decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular <a>Royal Netherlands East Indies Army</a> (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps <i>Prajoda</i> (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942, the Japanese forces landed near the town of Sanoer (Sanur). The island was quickly captured.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the Japanese occupation, a Balinese military officer, <a>I Gusti Ngurah Rai</a>, formed a Balinese 'freedom army'. The harshness of Japanese occupation forces made them more resented than the Dutch colonial rulers.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Independence_from%20the%20Dutch">Independence from the Dutch</h3>
<p>
In 1945, Bali was liberated by the British <a>5th infantry Division</a> under the command of Major-General <a>Robert Mansergh</a> who took the Japanese surrender. Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.

</p>
<p>
In 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed <a>State of East Indonesia</a>, a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by <a>Sukarno</a> and <a>Hatta</a>. Bali was included in the "Republic of the United States of Indonesia" when the Netherlands recognised Indonesian independence on 29 December 1949.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> The first governor of Bali, <a>Anak Agung Bagus Suteja</a>, was appointed by President Sukarno in 1958, when Bali became a province.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>
The 1963 eruption of <a>Mount Agung</a> killed thousands, created economic havoc and forced many displaced Balinese to be <a>transmigrated</a> to other parts of Indonesia. Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional <a>caste system</a>, and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the <a>Indonesian Communist Party</a> (PKI) and the <a>Indonesian Nationalist Party</a> (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programmes.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><a>An attempted coup</a>  in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.

</p>
<p>
The army became the dominant power as it instigated <a>a violent anti-communist purge</a>, in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup. Most estimates suggest that at least 500,000 people were killed across Indonesia, with an estimated 80,000 killed in Bali, equivalent to 5% of the island's population.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> With no Islamic forces involved as in Java and Sumatra, upper-caste PNI landlords led the extermination of PKI members.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As a result of the 1965–66 upheavals, Suharto was able to manoeuvre Sukarno <a>out of the presidency</a>. His <a>"New Order"</a> government re-established relations with Western countries. The pre-War Bali as "paradise" was revived in a modern form. The resulting large growth in tourism has led to a dramatic increase in Balinese standards of living and significant foreign exchange earned for the country.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>A bombing in 2002</a> by militant <a>Islamists</a> in the tourist area of <a>Kuta</a> killed 202 people, mostly foreigners. This attack, and <a>another in 2005</a>, severely reduced tourism, producing much economic hardship to the island.

</p>
<p>
On 27 November 2017, Mount Agung erupted five times, causing evacuation of thousands, disruption of air travel and environmental damage. <a>Further eruptions</a> also occurred between 2018 and 2019.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>

<p>
The island of Bali lies 3.2 km (2.0 mi) east of <a>Java</a>, and is approximately <a>8 degrees south</a> of the <a>equator</a>. Bali and Java are separated by the <a>Bali Strait</a>. East to west, the island is approximately 153 km (95 mi) wide and spans approximately 112 km (70 mi) north to south; administratively it covers 5,780 km<sup>2</sup> (2,230 sq mi), or 5,577 km<sup>2</sup> (2,153 sq mi) without <a>Nusa Penida</a> District,<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> which comprises three small islands off the southeast coast of Bali. Its population density was roughly 747 people/km<sup>2</sup> (1,930 people/sq mi) in 2020.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Bali%27s_Gunung_Agung_seen_at_sunset_from_Gunung_Rinjani.jpg/220px-Bali%27s_Gunung_Agung_seen_at_sunset_from_Gunung_Rinjani.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Bali's central mountains include several peaks over 2,000 metres (6,600 feet) in elevation and active volcanoes such as <a>Mount Batur</a>. The highest is <a>Mount Agung</a> (3,031 m, 9,944 ft), known as the "mother mountain", which is an active <a>volcano</a> rated as one of the world's most likely sites for a massive eruption within the next 100 years.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> In late 2017 <a>Mount Agung started erupting</a> and large numbers of people were evacuated, temporarily closing the island's airport.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Mountains range from centre to the eastern side, with Mount Agung the easternmost peak. Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, <a>Ayung River</a>, flows approximately 75 km (47 mi) (see <a>List of rivers of Bali</a>).

</p>
<p>
The island is surrounded by <a>coral reefs</a>. Beaches in the south tend to have white sand while those in the north and west have <a>black sand</a>. Bali has no major waterways, although the Ho River is navigable by small <i><a>sampan</a></i> boats. Black sand beaches between Pasut and Klatingdukuh are being developed for tourism, but apart from the seaside temple of <a>Tanah Lot</a>, they are not yet used for significant tourism.

</p>
<p>
The largest city is the provincial capital, <a>Denpasar</a>, near the southern coast. Its population is around 725,000 (2020). Bali's second-largest city is the old colonial capital, <a>Singaraja</a>, which is located on the north coast and is home to around 150,000 people in 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> Other important cities include the beach resort, <a>Kuta</a>, which is practically part of Denpasar's urban area, and <a>Ubud</a>, situated at the north of Denpasar, is the island's cultural centre.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Three small islands lie to the immediate south-east and all are administratively part of the <a>Klungkung</a> regency of Bali: <a>Nusa Penida</a>, <a>Nusa Lembongan</a> and <a>Nusa Ceningan</a>. These islands are separated from Bali by the <a>Badung Strait</a>.

</p>
<p>
To the east, the <a>Lombok Strait</a> separates Bali from <a>Lombok</a> and marks the <a>biogeographical</a> division between the fauna of the <a>Indomalayan realm</a> and the distinctly different fauna of <a>Australasia</a>. The transition is known as the <a>Wallace Line</a>, named after <a>Alfred Russel Wallace</a>, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major <a>biomes</a>. When sea levels dropped during the <a>Pleistocene ice age</a>, Bali was connected to Java and <a>Sumatra</a> and to the mainland of Asia and shared the Asian fauna, but the deep water of the Lombok Strait continued to keep Lombok Island and the <a>Lesser Sunda archipelago</a> isolated.

</p>
<h2 id="Climate">Climate</h2>
<p>
Being just 8 degrees south of the equator, Bali has a fairly even climate all year round. Average year-round temperature stands at around 30 °C (86 °F) with a humidity level of about 85%.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Daytime temperatures at low elevations vary between 20 to 33 °C (68 to 91 °F), but the temperatures decrease significantly with increasing elevation.

</p>
<p>
The west monsoon is in place from approximately October to April, and this can bring significant rain, particularly from December to March. During the rainy season, there are comparatively fewer tourists seen in Bali. During the Easter and Christmas holidays, the weather is very unpredictable. Outside of the monsoon period, humidity is relatively low and any rain is unlikely in lowland areas.

</p>

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Bali_Mynah_-_Houston_Zoo.jpg/170px-Bali_Mynah_-_Houston_Zoo.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Bali lies just to the west of the <a>Wallace Line</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> and thus has a fauna that is Asian in character, with very little Australasian influence, and has more in common with Java than with Lombok.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> An exception is the <a>yellow-crested cockatoo</a>, a member of a primarily Australasian family. There are around 280 species of birds, including the critically endangered <a>Bali myna</a>, which is <a>endemic</a>. Others include <a>barn swallow</a>, <a>black-naped oriole</a>, <a>black racket-tailed treepie</a>, <a>crested serpent-eagle</a>, <a>crested treeswift</a>, <a>dollarbird</a>, <a>Java sparrow</a>, <a>lesser adjutant</a>, <a>long-tailed shrike</a>, <a>milky stork</a>, <a>Pacific swallow</a>, <a>red-rumped swallow</a>, <a>sacred kingfisher</a>, <a>sea eagle</a>, <a>woodswallow</a>, <a>savanna nightjar</a>, <a>stork-billed kingfisher</a>, <a>yellow-vented bulbul</a> and <a>great egret</a>.

</p>
<p>
Until the early 20th century, Bali was possibly home to several <a>large mammals</a>: <a>leopard</a> and the endemic <a>Bali tiger</a>. The banteng still occurs in its domestic form, whereas leopards are found only in neighbouring Java, and the Bali tiger is extinct. The last definite record of a tiger on Bali dates from 1937, when one was shot, though the subspecies may have survived until the 1940s or 1950s.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> Pleistocene and Holocene megafaunas include <a>banteng</a> and <a>giant tapir</a> (based on speculations that they might have reached up to the <a>Wallace Line</a>),<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup><a>elephants</a> ,<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> and <a>rhinoceros</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>

<p>
<a>Squirrels</a> are quite commonly encountered, less often is the <a>Asian palm civet</a>, which is also kept in coffee farms to produce <a>kopi luwak</a>. <a>Bats</a> are well represented, perhaps the most famous place to encounter them remaining is the Goa Lawah (Temple of the Bats) where they are worshipped by the locals and also constitute a tourist attraction. They also occur in other cave temples, for instance at Gangga Beach. Two species of <a>monkey</a> occur. The <a>crab-eating macaque</a>, known locally as "kera", is quite common around human settlements and temples, where it becomes accustomed to being fed by humans, particularly in any of the three "monkey forest" temples, such as the popular one in the <a>Ubud</a> area. They are also quite often kept as pets by locals. The second monkey, endemic to Java and some surrounding islands such as Bali, is far rarer and more elusive and is the <a>Javan langur</a>, locally known as "lutung". They occur in a few places apart from the <a>West Bali National Park</a>. They are born an orange colour, though they would have already changed to a more blackish colouration by their first year.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In Java, however, there is more of a tendency for this species to retain its juvenile orange colour into adulthood, and a mixture of black and orange monkeys can be seen together as a family. Other rarer mammals include the <a>leopard cat</a>, <a>Sunda pangolin</a> and <a>black giant squirrel</a>.

<p>
Snakes include the <a>king cobra</a> and <a>reticulated python</a>. The <a>water monitor</a> can grow to at least 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length and 50 kg (110 lb)<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> and can move quickly.

<p>
The rich coral reefs around the coast, particularly around popular diving spots such as <a>Tulamben</a>, <a>Amed</a>, <a>Menjangan</a> or neighbouring <a>Nusa Penida</a>, host a wide range of marine life, for instance <a>hawksbill turtle</a>, <a>giant sunfish</a>, <a>giant manta ray</a>, <a>giant moray</a> eel, <a>bumphead parrotfish</a>, <a>hammerhead shark</a>, <a>reef shark</a>, <a>barracuda</a>, and <a>sea snakes</a>. Dolphins are commonly encountered on the north coast near <a>Singaraja</a> and <a>Lovina</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup>

<p>
A team of scientists conducted a survey from 29 April 2011 to 11 May 2011 at 33 sea sites around Bali. They discovered 952 species of reef fish of which 8 were new discoveries at Pemuteran, Gilimanuk, <a>Nusa Dua</a>, <a>Tulamben</a> and <a>Candidasa</a>, and 393 coral species, including two new ones at <a>Padangbai</a> and between Padangbai and <a>Amed</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> The average coverage level of healthy coral was 36% (better than in <a>Raja Ampat</a> and <a>Halmahera</a> by 29% or in <a>Fakfak</a> and <a>Kaimana</a> by 25%) with the highest coverage found in Gili Selang and Gili Mimpang in <a>Candidasa</a>, <a>Karangasem regency</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Among the larger trees the most common are: <a>banyan</a> trees, <a>jackfruit</a>, <a>coconuts</a>, <a>bamboo</a> species, <a>acacia</a> trees and also endless rows of coconuts and banana species. Numerous flowers can be seen: <a>hibiscus</a>, <a>frangipani</a>, <a>bougainvillea</a>, <a>poinsettia</a>, <a>oleander</a>, <a>jasmine</a>, <a>water lily</a>, <a>lotus</a>, <a>roses</a>, <a>begonias</a>, orchids and <a>hydrangeas</a> exist. On higher grounds that receive more moisture, for instance around <a>Kintamani</a>, certain species of <a>fern</a> trees, <a>mushrooms</a> and even <a>pine</a> trees thrive well. Rice comes in many varieties. Other plants with agricultural value include: <a>salak</a>, <a>mangosteen</a>, <a>corn</a>, kintamani orange, coffee and <a>water spinach</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Over-exploitation by the tourist industry has led to 200 out of 400 rivers on the island drying up. Research suggests that the southern part of Bali would face a water shortage.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> To ease the shortage, the central government plans to build a water catchment and processing facility at Petanu River in Gianyar. The 300 litres capacity of water per second will be channelled to Denpasar, Badung and Gianyar in 2013.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A 2010 Environment Ministry report on its environmental quality index gave Bali a score of 99.65, which was the highest score of Indonesia's 33 provinces. The score considers the level of <a>total suspended solids</a>, <a>dissolved oxygen</a> and <a>chemical oxygen demand</a> in water.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>

<p>
Erosion at Lebih Beach has seen seven metres (23 feet) of land lost every year. Decades ago, this beach was used for holy pilgrimages with more than 10,000 people, but they have now moved to <a>Masceti Beach</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2017, a year when Bali received nearly 5.7 million tourists, government officials declared a “garbage emergency” in response to the covering of 3.6 mile stretch of coastline in plastic waste brought in by the tide, amid concerns that the pollution could dissuade visitors from returning.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> Indonesia is one of the world's worst plastic polluters, with some estimates suggesting the country is the source of around 10 per cent of the world's plastic waste. Indonesia's capital city Jakarta features several large rubbish dumps and it is common to see swaths of plastics bobbing on the city's few waterways.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>

The province is divided into eight <a>regencies</a> (<i>kabupaten</i>) and one <a>city</a> (<i>kota</i>). These are, with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> and the 2020 Census.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Economy">Economy</h2>
<p>
In the 1970s, the Balinese economy was largely agriculture-based in terms of both output and employment.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> Tourism is now the largest single industry in terms of income, and as a result, Bali is one of Indonesia's wealthiest regions. In 2003, around 80% of Bali's economy was tourism related.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> By end of June 2011, the rate of <a>non-performing loans</a> of all banks in Bali were 2.23%, lower than the average of Indonesian banking industry non-performing loan rates (about 5%).<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> The economy, however, suffered significantly as a result of the <a>Islamists</a>' terrorist bombings in <a>2002</a> and <a>2005</a>. The tourism industry has since recovered from these events.

<p>
Although tourism produces the GDP's largest output, agriculture is still the island's biggest employer.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> Fishing also provides a significant number of jobs. Bali is also famous for its <a>artisans</a> who produce a vast array of handicrafts, including <a>batik</a> and <a>ikat</a><a>cloth and clothing</a> , <a>wooden carvings</a>, stone carvings, painted art and silverware. Notably, individual villages typically adopt a single product, such as wind chimes or wooden furniture.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Arabica coffee</a> production region is the highland region of <a>Kintamani</a> near <a>Mount Batur</a>. Generally, Balinese coffee is processed using the wet method. This results in a sweet, soft coffee with good consistency. Typical flavours include lemon and other citrus notes.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> Many coffee farmers in Kintamani are members of a traditional farming system called <a>Subak Abian</a>, which is based on the <a>Hindu</a> philosophy of "<a>Tri Hita Karana</a>". According to this philosophy, the three causes of happiness are good relations with <a>God</a>, other people, and the environment. The Subak Abian system is ideally suited to the production of <a>fair trade</a> and <a>organic coffee</a> production. Arabica coffee from Kintamani is the first product in Indonesia to request a <a>geographical indication</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup>

In 1963 the Bali Beach Hotel in <a>Sanur</a> was built by <a>Sukarno</a> and boosted tourism in Bali. Before the construction of the Bali Beach Hotel, there were only three significant tourist-class hotels on the island.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> Construction of hotels and restaurants began to spread throughout Bali. Tourism further increased in Bali after the <a>Ngurah Rai International Airport</a> opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.

</p>
<p>
The <a>tourism industry</a> is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of <a>Kuta</a> (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of <a>Legian</a> and <a>Seminyak</a> (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of <a>Sanur</a> (once the only tourist hub), <a>Ubud</a> towards the centre of the island, to the south of the <a>Ngurah Rai International Airport</a>, <a>Jimbaran</a> and the newer developments of <a>Nusa Dua</a> and <a>Pecatu</a>.

</p>
<p>
The United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008. The Australian government issued an advisory on Friday, 4 May 2012, with the overall level of this advisory lowered to 'Exercise a high degree of caution'. The Swedish government issued a new warning on Sunday, 10 June 2012 because of one tourist who died from methanol poisoning.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup> Australia last issued an advisory on Monday, 5 January 2015 due to new terrorist threats.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
An offshoot of tourism is the growing real estate industry. Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many <a>Jakarta</a> individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.

</p>
<p>
In the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.

</p>
<p>
Bali's tourism economy survived the <a>Islamists</a> terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre terrorist bombing levels; the long-term trend has been a steady increase in visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0–2.3 million tourists. The average occupancy of starred hotels achieved 65%, so the island still should be able to accommodate tourists for some years without any addition of new rooms/hotels,<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> although at the peak season some of them are fully booked.

</p>
<p>
Bali received the Best Island award from <a>Travel and Leisure</a> in 2010.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> Bali won because of its attractive surroundings (both mountain and coastal areas), diverse tourist attractions, excellent international and local restaurants, and the friendliness of the local people. The Balinese culture and its religion are also considered as the main factor of the award. One of the most prestigious events that symbolize a strong relationship between a god and its followers is <a>Kecak</a> dance. According to BBC Travel released in 2011, Bali is one of the World's Best Islands, ranking second after <a>Santorini</a>, Greece.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>

In 2006, <a>Elizabeth Gilbert</a>'s memoir <i><a>Eat, Pray, Love</a></i> was published, and in August 2010 it was adapted into the film <i><a>Eat Pray Love</a></i>. It took place at Ubud and Padang-Padang Beach in Bali. Both the book and the film fuelled a boom in tourism in Ubud, the hill town and cultural and tourist centre that was the focus of Gilbert's quest for balance and love through traditional spirituality and healing.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>

Since 2011, China has displaced Japan as the second-largest supplier of tourists to Bali, while Australia still tops the list while India has also emerged as a greater supply of tourists.
Chinese tourists increased by 17% from last year due to the impact of <a>ACFTA</a> and new direct flights to Bali.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>
In January 2012, Chinese tourists increased by 222.18% compared to January 2011, while Japanese tourists declined by 23.54% year on year.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup>
</p>

Bali authorities reported the island had 2.88 million foreign tourists and 5 million domestic tourists in 2012, marginally surpassing the expectations of 2.8 million foreign tourists.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Based on a <a>Bank Indonesia</a> survey in May 2013, 34.39 per cent of tourists are upper-middle class, spending between $1,286 to $5,592, and are dominated by Australia, India, France, China, Germany and the UK. Some Chinese tourists have increased their levels of spending from previous years. 30.26 percent of tourists are middle class, spending between $662 to $1,285.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> In 2017 it was expected that <a>Chinese</a> tourists would outnumber <a>Australian</a> tourists.

A coastal road circles the island, and three major two-lane arteries cross the central mountains at passes reaching 1,750 m in height (at Penelokan). The Ngurah Rai Bypass is a four-lane expressway that partly encircles Denpasar. Bali has no railway lines. There is a car ferry between Gilimanuk on the west coast of Bali to Ketapang on <a>Java</a>.

In December 2010 the Government of Indonesia invited investors to build a new Tanah Ampo Cruise Terminal at <a>Karangasem</a>, Bali with a projected worth of $30 million.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> On 17 July 2011 the first cruise ship (<a>Sun Princess</a>) anchored about 400 metres (1,300 feet) away from the wharf of Tanah Ampo harbour. The current pier is only 154 metres (505 feet) but will eventually be extended to 300 to 350 metres (980–1,150 feet) to accommodate international cruise ships. The harbour is safer than the existing facility at Benoa and has a scenic backdrop of east Bali mountains and green rice fields.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> The tender for improvement was subject to delays, and as of July 2013 the situation was unclear with cruise line operators complaining and even refusing to use the existing facility at Tanah Ampo.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>

On 21 December 2011 construction started on the Nusa Dua-Benoa-<a>Ngurah Rai International Airport</a> toll road which will also provide a special lane for motorcycles. This has been done by seven state-owned enterprises led by PT Jasa Marga with 60% of shares. PT Jasa Marga Bali Tol will construct the 9.91-kilometre-long (6.16-mile) toll road (totally 12.7 kilometres (7.89 miles) with access road). The construction is estimated to cost Rp.2.49 trillion ($273.9 million). The project goes through 2 kilometres (1 mile) of mangrove forest and through 2.3 kilometres (1.4 miles) of beach, both within 5.4 hectares (13 acres) area. The elevated toll road is built over the mangrove forest on 18,000 concrete pillars which occupied 2 hectares of mangroves forest. This was compensated by the planting of 300,000 mangrove trees along the road. On 21 December 2011 the Dewa Ruci 450-metre (1,480-foot) underpass has also started on the busy Dewa Ruci junction near Bali Kuta Galeria with an estimated cost of Rp136 billion ($14.9 million) from the state budget.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup> On 23 September 2013, the <a>Bali Mandara Toll Road</a> was opened, with the Dewa Ruci Junction (Simpang Siur) underpass being opened previously.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Caste_system">Caste system</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_caste_system">Balinese caste system</a></div>
<p>
Pre-modern Bali had four castes, as Jeff Lewis and Belinda Lewis state, but with a "very strong tradition of communal decision-making and interdependence".<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> The four castes have been classified as Sudra (<a>Shudra</a>), Wesia (<a>Vaishyas</a>), <a>Satria</a> (<a>Kshatriyas</a>) and Brahmana (<a>Brahmin</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The 19th-century scholars such as Crawfurd and Friederich suggested that the Balinese caste system had Indian origins, but Helen Creese states that scholars such as Brumund who had visited and stayed on the island of Bali suggested that his field observations conflicted with the "received understandings concerning its Indian origins".<sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup> In Bali, the Shudra (locally spelt <i>Soedra</i>) have typically been the temple priests, though depending on the demographics, a temple priest may also be from the other three castes.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> In most regions, it has been the Shudra who typically make offerings to the gods on behalf of the Hindu devotees, chant prayers, recite <i>meweda</i> (Vedas), and set the course of Balinese temple festivals.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup>

<p>
About 86.91% of Bali's population adheres to <a>Balinese Hinduism</a>, formed as a combination of existing <a>local beliefs</a> and <a>Hindu</a> influences from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia. Minority religions include <a>Islam</a> (10.05%), <a>Christianity</a> (2.35%), and <a>Buddhism</a> (0.68%) as for 2018.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The general beliefs and practices of <i>Agama Hindu Dharma</i> mix ancient traditions and contemporary pressures placed by Indonesian laws that permit only monotheist belief under the national ideology of <a><i>Pancasila</i></a>.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup> Traditionally, Hinduism in Indonesia had a pantheon of deities and that tradition of belief continues in practice; further, Hinduism in Indonesia granted freedom and flexibility to Hindus as to when, how and where to pray.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup> However, officially, the Indonesian government considers and advertises Indonesian Hinduism as a <a>monotheistic religion</a> with certain officially recognised beliefs that comply with its national ideology.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> Indonesian school textbooks describe Hinduism as having one supreme being, Hindus offering three daily mandatory prayers, and Hinduism as having certain common beliefs that in part parallel those of Islam.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> Scholars<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_111">[111]</a></sup> contest whether these Indonesian government recognised and assigned beliefs to reflect the traditional beliefs and practices of Hindus in Indonesia before Indonesia gained independence from Dutch colonial rule.

</p>
<p>
Balinese Hinduism has roots in Indian Hinduism and Buddhism, which arrived through <a>Java</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_112">[112]</a></sup> Hindu influences reached the <a>Indonesian Archipelago</a> as early as the first century.<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup> Historical evidence is unclear about the diffusion process of cultural and spiritual ideas from India. Java legends refer to Saka-era, traced to <a>78 CE</a>. Stories from the <a>Mahabharata</a> Epic have been traced in Indonesian islands to the 1st century; however, the versions mirror those found in the southeast Indian peninsular region (now <a>Tamil Nadu</a> and southern <a>Karnataka</a><a>Andhra Pradesh</a> ).<sup><a href="#ref_113">[113]</a></sup>

<p>
The Bali tradition adopted the pre-existing animistic traditions of the indigenous people. This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Apart from the majority of Balinese Hindus, there also exist <a>Chinese</a> immigrants whose traditions have melded with that of the locals. As a result, these Sino-Balinese embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, and find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's <i><a>odalan</a></i>. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese. Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup> The <a>Roman Catholic community</a> has a <a>diocese</a>, the <a>Diocese of Denpasar</a> that encompasses the province of Bali and <a>West Nusa Tenggara</a> and has its <a>cathedral</a> located in <a>Denpasar</a>.

<h3 id="Language">Language</h3>
<p>
<a>Balinese</a> and <a>Indonesian</a> are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of <a>Balinese people</a> are <a>bilingual</a> or <a>trilingual</a>. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from <a>Java</a>, <a>Lombok</a>, <a>Sumatra</a>, and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the <a>Balinese caste system</a> and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. <a>Kawi</a> and <a>Sanskrit</a> are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.

</p>
<p>
<a>English</a> and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the <a>tourism industry</a>, as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as <a>Japanese</a>, <a>Korean</a>, <a>French</a>, <a>Russian</a> or <a>German</a> are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.

<p>
Bali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. <a>Balinese cuisine</a> is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as <i><a>gamelan</a></i>, is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the <a>Ramayana</a> but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous <a>Balinese dances</a> include <i><a>pendet</a></i>, <i><a>legong</a></i>, <i><a>baris</a></i>, <i><a>topeng</a></i>, <i><a>barong</a></i>, <i><a>gong keybar</a></i>, and <i><a>kecak</a></i> (the monkey dance). Bali boasts one of the most diverse and innovative performing arts cultures in the world, with paid performances at thousands of temple festivals, private ceremonies, or public shows.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>
<i>Kaja</i> and <i>kelod</i> are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to one's orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (<i>kaja</i>), and the sea (<i>kelod</i>). In addition to spatial orientation, <i>kaja</i> and <i>kelod</i> have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Most temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest <i>kaja</i>. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as <i>wali</i>, the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where <i>bebali</i> ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called <i>bali-balihan</i>. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<sup><a href="#ref_119">[119]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Dances">Dances</h3>
<p>
Tourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of <a>tourism</a> is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the <i><a>barong</a></i><a>dance</a>  have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances that have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a <i>barong</i> mask specifically for non-ritual performances and an older mask that is only used for sacred performances.<sup><a href="#ref_120">[120]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Festivals">Festivals</h3>
<p>
Throughout the year, there are many festivals celebrated locally or island-wide according to the traditional calendars.<sup><a href="#ref_121">[121]</a></sup> The Hindu New Year, <i><a>Nyepi</a></i>, is celebrated in the spring by a day of silence. On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of <i><a>Ogoh-ogoh</a></i> monsters are paraded and burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese <i><a>pawukon</a></i><a>calendrical</a>  system.

</p>
<p>
Celebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), <a>cremation</a> or <i>odalan</i> (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of <i>désa kala patra</i>, which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup> Many ceremonial art forms such as <i><a>wayang</a> kulit</i> and <i><a>topeng</a></i> are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<sup><a href="#ref_122">[122]</a></sup> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with much activity and the resulting aesthetic, <i>ramé</i>, is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more <i><a>gamelan</a></i> ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of <i>ramé</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_123">[123]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Tradition">Tradition</h3>
<p>
Balinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as <a>customary law</a> sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including "<a>kasepekang</a>", or <a>shunning</a>) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<sup><a href="#ref_124">[124]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Other than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents <a>Bali Arts Festival</a> to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have. It is held once a year, from the second week of June until the end of July. Southeast Asia's biggest annual festival of words and ideas <a>Ubud Writers and Readers Festival</a> is held at <a>Ubud</a> in October, which is participated by the world's most celebrated writers, artists, thinkers and performers.<sup><a href="#ref_125">[125]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Beauty_pageant">Beauty pageant</h3>
<p>
Bali was the host of <a>Miss World 2013</a> (63rd edition of the Miss World pageant). It was the first time Indonesia hosted an international beauty pageant.

Bali is a major world <a>surfing</a> destination with popular breaks dotted across the southern coastline and around the offshore island of <a>Nusa Lembongan</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_126">[126]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As part of the <a>Coral Triangle</a>, Bali, including <a>Nusa Penida</a>, offers a wide range of dive sites with varying types of reefs, and tropical aquatic life.

</p>
<p>
Bali was the host of <a>2008 Asian Beach Games</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup> It was the second time Indonesia hosted an Asia-level <a>multi-sport event</a>, after <a>Jakarta</a> held the <a>1962 Asian Games</a>.

</p>
<p>
In <a>football</a>, Bali is home to <a>Bali United</a> football club, which plays in <a>Liga 1</a>.
The team was relocated from <a>Samarinda</a>, <a>East Kalimantan</a> to <a>Gianyar</a>, Bali. Harbiansyah Hanafiah, the main commissioner of Bali United explained that he changed the name and moved the home base because there was no representative from Bali in the highest football tier in Indonesia.<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup> Another reason was due to local fans in Samarinda preferring to support <a>Pusamania Borneo F.C.</a> rather than Persisam.
