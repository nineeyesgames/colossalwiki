<p>
<b>Wyoming</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>w</span><span>aɪ</span><span>ˈ</span><span>oʊ</span><span>m</span><span>ɪ</span><span>ŋ</span></span>/</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span></span>) is a <a>state</a> in the <a>Mountain West</a> subregion of the <a>Western United States</a>. The <a>10th largest state by area</a>, it is also the <a>least populous</a> and <a>least densely populated state</a> in the <a>contiguous United States</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_a">[a]</a></sup> It is bordered by <a>Montana</a> to the north and northwest, <a>South Dakota</a> and <a>Nebraska</a> to the east, <a>Idaho</a> to the west, <a>Utah</a> to the southwest, and <a>Colorado</a> to the south. The state population was 576,851 at the <a>2020 United States census</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> making it the least populated U.S. state. The <a>state capital</a> and the <a>most populous city</a> is <a>Cheyenne</a>, which had an estimated population of 63,957 in 2018.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wyoming's western half is mostly covered by the ranges and rangelands of the <a>Rocky Mountains</a>, while the eastern half of the state is high-elevation <a>prairie</a> called the <a>High Plains</a>. It is drier and windier than the rest of the country, being split between <a>semi-arid</a> and <a>continental</a> climates with greater temperature extremes. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the <a>federal government</a>, leading the state to rank 6th by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Federal lands include two national parks—<a>Grand Teton</a> and <a>Yellowstone</a>—two national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.

</p>
<p>
Original inhabitants of the region include the <a>Arapaho</a>, <a>Crow</a>, <a>Lakota</a>, and <a>Shoshone</a>. Southwest Wyoming was claimed by the <a>Spanish Empire</a> and then as Mexican territory until it was ceded to the U.S. in 1848 at the end of the <a>Mexican–American War</a>. The region acquired the name "Wyoming" when a bill was introduced to <a>Congress</a> in 1865 to provide a temporary government for <a>the territory of Wyoming</a>. The name had been used earlier for the <a>Wyoming Valley</a> in <a>Pennsylvania</a>, and is derived from the <a>Munsee</a> word <i>xwé:wamənk</i>, meaning "at the big river flat".<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wyoming's economy is driven by tourism and the extraction of minerals such as <a>coal</a>, <a>natural gas</a>, <a>oil</a>, and <a>trona</a>. Agricultural commodities include barley, hay, livestock, <a>sugar beets</a>, wheat, and wool. It was the first state to allow women the <a>right to vote</a> and become politicians, as well as the first state to elect a female governor. Due to this part of its history, its main nickname is "The Equality State" and its official state motto is "Equal Rights".<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> It has been a politically conservative state since the 1950s, with the <a>Republican</a> presidential nominee carrying the state in every election since <a>1968</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> A notable exception is <a>Teton County</a>, which has achieved notability for being Wyoming's most <a>Democratic</a> county and the only county in the state to be won by a Democrat in every election since <a>2004</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wyoming">History of Wyoming</a></div>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Alfred_Jacob_Miller_-_Fort_Laramie_-_Walters_37194049.jpg/220px-Alfred_Jacob_Miller_-_Fort_Laramie_-_Walters_37194049.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Several Native American groups originally inhabited the region now known as Wyoming. The <a>Crow</a>, <a>Arapaho</a>, <a>Lakota</a>, and <a>Shoshone</a> were but a few of the original inhabitants white explorers encountered when they first visited the region. What is now southwestern Wyoming became a part of the <a>Spanish Empire</a>, and later Mexican territory, of <a>Alta California</a>, until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the <a>Mexican–American War</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>French-Canadian</a> trappers from Québec and Montréal ventured into the area in the late 18th century, leaving French toponyms such as Téton and <a>La Ramie</a>. <a>John Colter</a>, a member of the <a>Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, itself guided by French Canadian <a>Toussaint Charbonneau</a> and his young Shoshone wife, <a>Sacagawea</a>, first described the region in 1807. At the time, his reports of the <a>Yellowstone</a> area were considered to be fictional.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup><a>Robert Stuart</a>  and a party of five men, returning from <a>Astoria</a>, discovered <a>South Pass</a> in 1812. The <a>Oregon Trail</a> later followed that route. In 1850, <a>Jim Bridger</a> located what is now known as <a>Bridger Pass</a>, which the <a>Union Pacific Railroad</a> used in 1868, as did <a>Interstate 80</a>, 90 years later. Bridger also explored Yellowstone and filed reports on the region that, like those of Colter, were largely regarded at the time as <a>tall tales</a>.

</p>
<p>
The region acquired the name <i>Wyoming</i> by 1865, when Representative <a>James Mitchell Ashley</a> of <a>Ohio</a> introduced a bill to Congress to provide a "temporary government for <a>the territory of Wyoming</a>". The territory was named after the <a>Wyoming Valley</a> in Pennsylvania, made famous by the 1809 poem <i><a>Gertrude of Wyoming</a></i> by <a>Thomas Campbell</a>, based on the <a>Battle of Wyoming</a> in the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>. The name ultimately derives from the <a>Munsee</a> word <i>xwé:wamənk</i>, meaning 'at the big river flat'.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Wyoming_Jeep_Trail.JPG/170px-Wyoming_Jeep_Trail.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The region's population grew steadily after the <a>Union Pacific Railroad</a> reached the town of <a>Cheyenne</a> in 1867, and the federal government established the <a>Wyoming Territory</a> on July 25, 1868.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> Wyoming lacked significant deposits of gold and silver, unlike mineral-rich <a>Colorado</a>, and did not experience Colorado's related population boom. However, <a>South Pass City</a> did have a short-lived boom after the Carissa Mine began producing gold in 1867.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> Furthermore, copper was mined in some areas between the <a>Sierra Madre Mountains</a> and the Snowy Range near <a>Grand Encampment</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Once government-sponsored expeditions to the Yellowstone country began, reports by Colter and Bridger, previously believed to be apocryphal, were found to be true. That led to the creation of <a>Yellowstone National Park</a>, which became the world's first <a>national park</a> in 1872. Nearly all of Yellowstone National Park lies within the far northwestern borders of Wyoming.

</p>
<p>
On December 10, 1869, territorial Governor <a>John Allen Campbell</a> extended the right to vote to women, making Wyoming the first territory and, later, United States state, to grant <a>suffrage</a> to women. Wyoming was also a pioneer in welcoming women into politics. Women first served on juries in Wyoming (<a>Laramie</a> in 1870). Wyoming had the first female court bailiff (<a>Mary Atkinson</a>, Laramie, in 1870), and the first female <a>justice of the peace</a> in the country (<a>Esther Hobart Morris</a>, South Pass City, in 1870). As well, in 1924, Wyoming became the first state to elect a female governor, <a>Nellie Tayloe Ross</a>, who took office in January 1925.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Due to its civil-rights history, one of Wyoming's state nicknames is "The Equality State", and the official state motto is "Equal Rights".<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wyoming's constitution included <a>women's suffrage</a> and a pioneering article on <a>water rights</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> Congress admitted Wyoming into the Union as the 44th state on July 10, 1890.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wyoming was the location of the <a>Johnson County War</a> of 1892, which erupted between competing groups of cattle ranchers. The passage of the federal <a>Homestead Act</a> led to an influx of small ranchers. A <a>range war</a> broke out when either or both of the groups chose violent conflict over commercial competition in the use of the public land.

<p>
Wyoming's climate is generally <a>semi-arid</a> and <a>continental</a> (<a>Köppen climate classification</a><i><a><i>BSk</i></a></i> ), and is drier and windier in comparison to most of the United States with greater temperature extremes. Much of this is due to the topography of the state. Summers in Wyoming are warm with July high temperatures averaging between 80 and 90 °F (27 and 32 °C) in most of the state. With increasing elevation, however, this average drops rapidly with locations above 9,000 feet (2,700 m) averaging around 70 °F (21 °C). Summer nights throughout the state are characterized by a rapid cooldown with even the hottest locations averaging in the 50–60 °F (10–16 °C) range at night. In most of the state, most of the precipitation tends to fall in the late spring and early summer. Winters are cold, but are variable with periods of sometimes extreme cold interspersed between generally mild periods, with <a>Chinook winds</a> providing unusually warm temperatures in some locations.

</p>
<p>
Wyoming is a dry state with much of the land receiving less than 10 inches (250 mm) of rainfall per year. Precipitation depends on elevation with lower areas in the <a>Big Horn Basin</a> averaging 5–8 inches (130–200 mm), making the area nearly a true <a>desert</a>. The lower areas in the North and on the eastern plains typically average around 10–12 inches (250–300 mm), making the climate there <a>semi-arid</a>. Some mountain areas do receive a good amount of precipitation, 20 inches (510 mm) or more, much of it as snow, sometimes 200 inches (510 cm) or more annually. The state's highest recorded temperature is 114 °F (46 °C) at <a>Basin</a> on July 12, 1900, and the lowest recorded temperature is −66 °F (−54 °C) at <a>Riverside</a> on February 9, 1933.

</p>
<p>
The number of <a>thunderstorm</a> days vary across the state with the southeastern plains of the state having the most days of thunderstorm activity. Thunderstorm activity in the state is highest during the late spring and early summer. The southeastern corner of the state is the most vulnerable part of the state to <a>tornado</a> activity. Moving away from that point and westwards, the incidence of tornadoes drops dramatically with the west part of the state showing little vulnerability. Tornadoes, where they occur, tend to be small and brief, unlike some of those that occur farther east.

As specified in the designating legislation for the <a>Territory of Wyoming</a>, Wyoming's borders are lines of <a>latitude</a><a>41°N</a>  and <a>45°N</a>, and <a>longitude</a> 104°3'W and 111°3'W (27 and 34 west of the <a>Washington Meridian</a>)—a <a>geodesic</a> quadrangle.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> Wyoming is one of only three states (the others being <a>Colorado</a> and <a>Utah</a>) to have borders defined by <i>only</i> "straight" lines. Due to surveying inaccuracies during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal border deviates from the true <a>latitude</a> and <a>longitude</a> lines by up to half of a mile (0.8 km) in some spots, especially in the mountainous region along the <a>45th parallel</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> Wyoming is bordered on the north by <a>Montana</a>, on the east by <a>South Dakota</a> and <a>Nebraska</a>, on the south by <a>Colorado</a>, on the southwest by <a>Utah</a>, and on the west by <a>Idaho</a>. It is the tenth largest state in the United States in total area, containing 97,814 square miles (253,340 km<sup>2</sup>) and is made up of 23 counties. From the north border to the south border it is 276 miles (444 km); and from the east to the west border is 365 miles (587 km) at its south end and 342 miles (550 km) at the north end.

<p>
The <a>Great Plains</a> meet the <a>Rocky Mountains</a> in Wyoming. The state is a great <a>plateau</a> broken by many <a>mountain ranges</a>. Surface elevations range from the summit of <a>Gannett Peak</a> in the <a>Wind River Mountain Range</a>, at 13,804 feet (4,207 m), to the <a>Belle Fourche River</a> valley in the state's northeast corner, at 3,125 feet (952 m). In the northwest are the <a>Absaroka</a>, <a>Owl Creek</a>, <a>Gros Ventre</a>, <a>Wind River</a>, and the <a>Teton</a> ranges. In the north central are the <a>Big Horn Mountains</a>; in the northeast, the <a>Black Hills</a>; and in the southern region the <a>Laramie</a>, <a>Snowy</a>, and <a>Sierra Madre</a> ranges.

</p>
<p>
The Snowy Range in the south central part of the state is an extension of the Colorado <a>Rockies</a> both in geology and in appearance. The Wind River Range in the west central part of the state is remote and includes more than 40 mountain peaks in excess of 13,000 ft (4,000 m) tall in addition to Gannett Peak, the highest peak in the state. The Big Horn Mountains in the north central portion are somewhat isolated from the bulk of the Rocky Mountains.

</p>
<p>
The Teton Range in the northwest extends for 50 miles (80 km), part of which is included in <a>Grand Teton National Park</a>. The park includes the <a>Grand Teton</a>, the second highest peak in the state.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Continental Divide</a> spans north–south across the central portion of the state. Rivers east of the divide drain into the <a>Missouri River Basin</a> and eventually the <a>Gulf of Mexico</a>. They are the <a>North Platte</a>, <a>Wind</a>, <a>Big Horn</a> and the <a>Yellowstone</a> rivers. The <a>Snake River</a> in northwest Wyoming eventually drains into the <a>Columbia River</a> and the Pacific Ocean, as does the <a>Green River</a> through the <a>Colorado River</a> Basin.

</p>
<p>
The Continental Divide forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the <a>Great Divide Basin</a> where water that precipitates onto or flows into it cannot reach an ocean—it <i>all</i> sinks into the soil and eventually evaporates.

</p>
<p>
Several rivers begin in or flow through the state, including the Yellowstone River, Bighorn River, Green River, and the Snake River.

</p>
<p>
Much of Wyoming is covered with large basins containing different eco-regions, from shrublands to smaller patches of desert.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> Regions of the state classified as basins contain everything from large geologic formations to sand dunes and vast unpopulated spaces.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Basin landscapes are typically at lower elevations and include rolling hills, valleys, mesas, terraces and other rugged terrain, but also include natural springs as well as rivers and artificial reservoirs.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> They have common plant species such as various subspecies of <a>sagebrush</a>, <a>juniper</a> and grasses such as <a>wheatgrass</a>, but basins are known for their diversity of plant and animal species.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>
According to the 2012 United States Bureau of Economic Analysis report, Wyoming's <a>gross state product</a> was $38.4 billion.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> As of 2014 the population was growing slightly with the most growth in tourist-oriented areas such as <a>Teton County</a>. Boom conditions in neighboring states such as <a>North Dakota</a> were drawing energy workers away. About half of Wyoming's counties showed population losses.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> The state makes active efforts through Wyoming Grown, an internet-based recruitment program, to find jobs for young people educated in Wyoming who have emigrated but may wish to return.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The mineral extraction industry and travel and tourism sector are the main drivers behind Wyoming's economy. The federal government owns about 50% of its landmass, while 6% is controlled by the state. Total taxable values of mining production in Wyoming for 2001 was over $6.7 billion. The <a>tourism industry</a> accounts for over $2 billion in revenue for the state.

</p>
<p>
In 2002, more than six million people visited Wyoming's <a>national parks</a> and monuments. The key tourist attractions in Wyoming include <a>Grand Teton National Park</a>, <a>Yellowstone National Park</a>, <a>Devils Tower National Monument</a>, <a>Independence Rock</a> and <a>Fossil Butte National Monument</a>. Each year Yellowstone National Park, the world's first national park, receives three million visitors.

</p>
<p>
Historically, agriculture has been an important component of Wyoming's economy. Its overall importance to the performance of Wyoming's economy has waned. However, agriculture is still an essential part of Wyoming's culture and lifestyle. The main agricultural commodities produced in Wyoming include livestock (beef), <a>hay</a>, <a>sugar beets</a>, grain (wheat and barley), and <a>wool</a>. More than 91% of land in Wyoming is classified as rural.

</p>
<p>
Wyoming is the home of only a handful of companies with a regional or national presence. <a>Taco John's</a> and <a>Sierra Trading Post</a>, both in Cheyenne, are privately held. <a>Cloud Peak Energy</a> in Gillette and U.S. Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: USEG) in Riverton are Wyoming's only publicly traded companies.

<ul><li>Coal: Wyoming produced 277 million short tons (251.29 million metric tons) of coal in 2019 which was a 9 percent drop from the year before.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> Wyoming's coal production peaked in 2008 when 514 million short tons (466.3 million metric tons) was produced.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> Wyoming possesses a reserve of 68.7 billion tons (62.3 billion metric tons) of coal. Major coal areas include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_River_Basin">Powder River Basin</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_Basin">Green River Basin</a>.</li><li>Coalbed methane (CBM): The boom for CBM began in the mid-1990s. CBM is characterized as methane gas that is extracted from Wyoming's coal bed seams. It is another means of natural gas production. There has been substantial CBM production in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_River_Basin">Powder River Basin</a>. In 2002, the CBM production yield was 327.5 billion cubic feet (9.3 km<sup>3</sup>).</li><li>Crude oil: Wyoming produced 53.4 million barrels (8.49<span>×<span>10</span></span><s>^</s><sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup>) of crude oil in 2007. The state ranked fifth nationwide in oil production in 2007.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Petroleum is most often used as a motor fuel, but it is also utilized in the manufacture of plastics, paints, and synthetic rubber.</li><li>Diamonds: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Lake_Diamond_Mine">Kelsey Lake Diamond Mine</a>, located in Colorado less than 1,000 feet (300 m) from the Wyoming border, produced gem quality diamonds for several years. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_craton">Wyoming craton</a>, which hosts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberlite">kimberlite</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_pipe">volcanic pipes</a>  that were mined, underlies most of Wyoming.</li><li>Natural gas: Wyoming produced 1.77 trillion cubic feet (50.0 billion m<sup>3</sup>) of natural gas in 2016. The state ranked 6th nationwide for natural gas production in 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> The major markets for natural gas include industrial, commercial, and domestic heating.</li><li>Trona: Wyoming possesses the world's largest known reserve of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trona">trona</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> a mineral used for manufacturing glass, paper, soaps, baking soda, water softeners, and pharmaceuticals. In 2008, Wyoming produced 46 million short tons (41.7 million metric tons) of trona, 25% of the world's production.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup></li><li>Wind power: Because of Wyoming's geography and high-altitude, the potential for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_in_Wyoming">wind power in Wyoming</a> is one of the highest of any state in the US. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chokecherry_and_Sierra_Madre_Wind_Energy_Project">Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project</a> is the largest commercial wind generation facility under development in North America.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_County,_Wyoming">Carbon County</a>  is home to the largest proposed wind farm in the US. However, construction plans have been halted because of proposed new taxes on wind power energy production.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup></li><li>Uranium: Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining_in_Wyoming">uranium mining in Wyoming</a> is much less active than it was in previous decades, recent increases in the price of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium">uranium</a> have generated new interest in uranium prospecting and mining.</li></ul>
<h3 id="Taxes">Taxes</h3>
<p>
Unlike most other states, Wyoming does not levy an individual or corporate <a>income tax</a>. In addition, Wyoming does not assess any tax on retirement income earned and received from another state. Wyoming has a state <a>sales tax</a> of 4%. Counties have the option of collecting an additional 1% tax for general revenue and a 1% tax for specific purposes, if approved by voters. Food for human consumption is not subject to sales tax.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> There also is a county lodging tax that varies from 2% to 5%. The state collects a <a>use tax</a> of 5% on items purchased elsewhere and brought into Wyoming.
All <a>property tax</a> is based on the assessed value of the property and Wyoming's Department of Revenue's Ad Valorem Tax Division supports, trains, and guides local government agencies in the uniform assessment, valuation and taxation of locally assessed property. "Assessed value" means taxable value; "taxable value" means a percent of the fair market value of property in a particular class. Statutes limit property tax increases. For county revenue, the property tax rate cannot exceed 12 <a>mills</a> (or 1.2%) of assessed value. For cities and towns, the rate is limited to eight <a>mills</a> (0.8%). With very few exceptions, state law limits the property tax rate for all governmental purposes.

</p>
<p>
<a>Personal property</a> held for personal use is tax-exempt. Inventory if held for resale, pollution control equipment, cash, accounts receivable, stocks and bonds are also exempt. Other exemptions include property used for religious, educational, charitable, fraternal, benevolent and government purposes and improvements for handicapped access. Mine lands, underground mining equipment, and oil and gas extraction equipment are exempt from property tax but companies must pay a gross products tax on minerals and a <a>severance tax</a> on mineral production.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wyoming does not collect <a>inheritance taxes</a>. There is limited <a>estate tax</a> related to federal estate tax collection.

</p>
<p>
In 2008, the <a>Tax Foundation</a> ranked Wyoming as having the single most "business friendly" tax climate of all 50 states.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Wyoming state and local governments in fiscal year 2007 collected $2.242 billion in taxes, levies, and royalties from the oil and gas industry. The state's mineral industry, including oil, gas, <a>trona</a>, and coal provided $1.3 billion in property taxes from 2006 mineral production.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> As of 2017, Wyoming receives more federal tax dollars as a percentage of state general revenue than any state except neighboring <a>Montana</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As of 2016, Wyoming does not require the beneficial owners of LLCs to be disclosed in the filing, which creates an opportunity for a tax haven, according to <a>Clark Stith</a> of Clark Stith & Associates in Rock Springs, Wyoming, a former Republican candidate for Wyoming secretary of state.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>

The largest airport in Wyoming is <a>Jackson Hole Airport</a>, with more than 500 employees.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup> Three interstate highways and thirteen United States highways pass through Wyoming. In addition, the state is served by the <a>Wyoming state highway system</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a>Interstate 25</a> enters the state south of Cheyenne and runs north, intersecting Interstate 80 immediately west of Cheyenne. It passes through Casper and ends at Interstate 90 near <a>Buffalo</a>. <a>Interstate 80</a> crosses the Utah border west of <a>Evanston</a> and runs east through the southern third of the state, passing through Cheyenne before entering Nebraska near <a>Pine Bluffs</a>. <a>Interstate 90</a> comes into Wyoming near <a>Parkman</a> and cuts through the northeastern part of the state. It serves <a>Gillette</a> and enters South Dakota east of <a>Sundance</a>.

</p>
<p>
U.S. Routes <a>14</a>, <a>16</a>, and <a>the eastern section of U.S. 20</a> all have their western terminus at the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National Park and pass through <a>Cody</a>. U.S. 14 travels eastward before joining I-90 at <a>Gillette</a>. U.S. 14 then follows I-90 to the South Dakota border. U.S. 16 and 20 split off of U.S. 14 at <a>Greybull</a> and U.S. 16 turns east at <a>Worland</a> while U.S. 20 continues south <a>Shoshoni</a>. <a>U.S. Route 287</a> carries traffic from <a>Fort Collins, Colorado</a> into <a>Laramie, Wyoming</a> through a pass between the <a>Laramie Mountains</a> and the <a>Medicine Bow Mountains</a>, merges with US 30 and I-80 until it reaches Rawlins, where it continues north, passing Lander. Outside of <a>Moran</a>, U.S. 287 is part of a large interchange with U.S. Highways 26, 191, and 89, before continuing north to the southern entrance of Yellowstone. U.S. 287 continues north of Yellowstone, but the two sections are separated by the national park.

</p>
<p>
Other <a>U.S. highways</a> that pass through the state are <a>18</a>, <a>26</a>, <a>30</a>, <a>85</a>, <a>87</a>, <a>89</a>, <a>189</a>, <a>191</a>, <a>212</a>, and <a>287</a>.

<p>
The Wind River <a>Indian Reservation</a> is shared by the <a>Eastern Shoshone</a> and <a>Northern Arapaho</a> tribes of Native Americans in the central western portion of the state near <a>Lander</a>. The reservation is home to 2,500 Eastern Shoshone and 5,000 Northern Arapaho.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Chief Washakie</a> established the reservation in 1868<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> as the result of negotiations with the federal government in the <a>Fort Bridger</a> Treaty.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> However, the Northern Arapaho were forced onto the Shoshone reservation in 1876 by the federal government after the government failed to provide a promised separate reservation.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Today the Wind River Indian Reservation is jointly owned, with each tribe having a 50% interest in the land, water, and other natural resources.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> The reservation is a sovereign, self-governed land with two independent governing bodies: the Eastern Shoshone Tribe and the Northern Arapaho Tribe. Until 2014, the Shoshone Business Council and Northern Arapaho Business Council met jointly as the Joint Business Council to decide matters that affect both tribes.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> Six elected council members from each tribe served on the joint council.

Nearly half the land in Wyoming (about 30,099,430 acres (121,808.1 km<sup>2</sup>)) is owned by the <a>federal government</a>; the state owns another 3,864,800 acres (15,640 km<sup>2</sup>).<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Most of it is administered by the <a>Bureau of Land Management</a> and <a>U.S. Forest Service</a> in numerous <a>national forests</a> and a <a>national grassland</a>, not to mention vast swaths of "public" land and an <a>air force base</a> near Cheyenne.

The <a>United States Census Bureau</a> estimates the population of Wyoming was 578,759 in 2019,<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> The <a>center of population</a> of Wyoming is in <a>Natrona County</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2014, the United States Census Bureau estimated the population's racial composition was 92.7% <a>white</a> (82.9% non-Hispanic white), 2.7% American Indian and Alaska Native, 1.6% Black or African American, 1.0% Asian American, and 0.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> As of 2011, 24.9% of Wyoming's population younger than age<span></span>1 were minorities.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the 2010 census, the racial composition of the population was 90.7% white, 0.8% black or African American, 2.4% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.8% Asian American, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 2.2% from two or more races, and 3.0% from some other race. Ethnically, 8.9% of the total population was of <a>Hispanic</a> or Latino origin (they may be of any race) and 91.1% Non-Hispanic, with <a>non-Hispanic whites</a> constituting the largest non-Hispanic group at 85.9%.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As of 2015, Wyoming had an estimated population of 586,107, which was an increase of 1,954, or 0.29%, from the prior year and an increase of 22,481, or 3.99%, since the <a>2010 census</a>. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 4,035 into the state. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 2,264 and migration within the country produced a net increase of 1,771. In 2004, the foreign-born population was 11,000 (2.2%). In 2005, total births in Wyoming were 7,231 (birth rate of 14.04 per thousand).<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> Sparsely populated, Wyoming is the least populous state of the United States. Wyoming has the second-lowest population density in the country (behind <a>Alaska</a>) and is the sparsest-populated of the 48 <a>contiguous states</a>. It is one of only two states (<a>Vermont</a>) with a population smaller than that of the nation's capital.

<p>
According to the 2000 census, the largest ancestry groups in Wyoming are: <a>German</a> (26.0%), <a>English</a> (16.0%), <a>Irish</a> (13.3%), <a>Norwegian</a> (4.3%), and <a>Swedish</a> (3.5%).<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>failed verification</span></a></i>]</sup>

<h3 id="State_government">State government</h3>
<p>
Wyoming's Constitution established three branches of government: the <a>executive</a>, <a>legislative</a>, and <a>judicial</a> branches. The <a>state legislature</a> comprises a <a>House of Representatives</a> with 60 members and a <a>Senate</a> with 30 members. The executive branch is headed by the <a>governor</a> and includes a <a>secretary of state</a>, <a>auditor</a>, treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Wyoming does not have a <a>lieutenant governor</a>. The secretary of state is first in the line of succession.

</p>
<p>
Wyoming's sparse population warrants it only one <a>at-large</a> seat in the <a>U.S. House of Representatives</a>, and hence only three votes in the <a>Electoral College</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Wyoming State Liquor Association</a> is the state's sole legal wholesale distributor of spirits, making it an <a>alcoholic beverage control state</a>. With the exception of wine, state law prohibits the purchase of alcoholic beverages for resale from any other source.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Judicial_system">Judicial system</h3>
<p>
Wyoming's highest court is the <a>Supreme Court of Wyoming</a>, with five justices presiding over appeals from the state's lower courts. Wyoming is unusual in that it does not have an intermediate <a>appellate court</a>, like most states. This is largely attributable to the state's population and correspondingly lower caseload. Appeals from the state district courts go directly to the Wyoming Supreme Court. Wyoming also has state circuit courts (formerly county courts), of limited jurisdiction, which handle certain types of cases, such as civil claims with lower dollar amounts, misdemeanor criminal offenses, and <a>felony</a><a>arraignments</a> . Circuit court judges also commonly hear small claims cases as well.

</p>
<p>
Before 1972, Wyoming judges were selected by popular vote on a nonpartisan ballot. This earlier system was criticized by the state bar who called for the adoption of the <a>Missouri Plan</a>, a system designed to balance judiciary independence with judiciary accountability. In 1972, an amendment to Article<span></span>5 of the Wyoming Constitution, which incorporated a modified version of the plan, was adopted by the voters. Since the adoption of the amendment, all state court judges in Wyoming are nominated by the Judicial Nominating Commission and appointed by the Governor. They are then subject to a <a>retention vote</a> by the electorate one year after appointment.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup>

Wyoming's political history defies easy classification. The state was the first to grant women the right to vote and to elect a woman governor.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> On December 10, 1869, <a>John Allen Campbell</a>, the first Governor of the Wyoming Territory, approved the first law in United States history explicitly granting women the right to vote. This day was later commemorated as Wyoming Day.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> On November 5, 1889, voters approved the first constitution in the world granting full voting rights to women.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
While the state elected notable <a>Democrats</a> to federal office in the 1960s and 1970s, politics have become decidedly more conservative since the 1980s as the <a>Republican Party</a> came to dominate the state's congressional delegation. Today, Wyoming is represented in Washington by its two Senators, <a>John Barrasso</a> and <a>Cynthia Lummis</a>, and its one member of the House of Representatives, Congresswoman <a>Liz Cheney</a>. All three are Republicans; a Democrat has not represented Wyoming in the Senate since 1977 or in the House since 1978. The state has not voted for a Democrat for president since 1964, one of only eight times since statehood. At present, there is only one relatively reliably Democratic county, affluent <a>Teton</a>, and one swing county, college county <a>Albany</a>. In the 2004 presidential election, <a>George W. Bush</a> won his second-largest victory, with 69% of the vote. Former Vice President <a>Dick Cheney</a> is a Wyoming resident and represented the state in Congress from 1979 to 1989.

</p>
<p>
Republicans are no less dominant at the state level. They have held a majority in the state senate continuously since 1936 and in the state house since 1964. However, Democrats held the <a>governorship</a> for all but eight years between 1975 and 2011. Uniquely, Wyoming elected Democrat <a>Nellie Tayloe Ross</a> as the first woman in United States history to serve as state governor. She served from 1925 to 1927, winning a special election after her husband, <a>William Bradford Ross</a>, unexpectedly died a little more than a year into his term.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Sports">Sports</h3>
<p>
Due to its sparse population, Wyoming lacks any major professional sports teams. However, the <a>Wyoming Cowboys and Cowgirls</a>—particularly the football and basketball teams—are quite popular. Their stadiums in Laramie are about 7,200 feet (2,200 m) above sea level, the highest in <a>NCAA Division<span></span>I</a>. The <a>Wyoming High School Activities Association</a> also sponsors twelve sports.

<a>Casper</a> has hosted the <a>College National Finals Rodeo</a> since 2001.

<a>Public education</a> is directed by the state superintendent of public instruction, an elected state official. Educational policies are set by the State Board of Education, a nine-member board appointed by the governor. The constitution prohibits the state from establishing curriculum and textbook selections; these are the prerogatives of local school boards. The <a>Wyoming School for the Deaf</a> was the only in-state school dedicated to supporting <a>deaf</a> students in Wyoming before its closure in the summer of 2000.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>

Before the passing of a new law in 2006, Wyoming had hosted unaccredited institutions, many of them suspected <a>diploma mills</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> The 2006 law requires unaccredited institutions to make one of three choices: move out of Wyoming, close down, or apply for accreditation. The <a>Oregon State Office of Degree Authorization</a> predicted in 2007 that in a few years the problem of diploma mills in Wyoming might be resolved.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup>
