<b>Vermont</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>v</span><span>ər</span><span>ˈ</span><span>m</span><span>ɒ</span><span>n</span><span>t</span></span>/</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span></span>)<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> is a <a>state</a> in the <a>New England</a> region of the United States. It borders the states of <a>Massachusetts</a> to the south, <a>New Hampshire</a> to the east, and <a>New York</a> to the west, and the <a>Canadian province</a> of <a>Quebec</a> to the north. Vermont is the only state in New England that does not border the Atlantic Ocean. Vermont is the <a>second-least-populated</a> U.S. state after <a>Wyoming</a> and the <a>sixth-smallest by area</a> of the <a>50 U.S. states</a> with a recorded population of 643,503 according to the <a>2020 U.S. census</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> The <a>state capital</a> is <a>Montpelier</a>, the least-populous state capital in the United States. The most-populous city, <a>Burlington</a>, is the least-populous city to be the <a>most-populous city in a state</a>.

</p>
<p>
For some 12,000 years, <a>indigenous peoples</a> inhabited this area. The historically competitive tribes of the <a>Algonquian</a>-speaking <a>Abenaki</a> and <a>Iroquoian</a>-speaking <a>Mohawk</a> were active in the area at the time of European encounter. During the 17th century, French colonists claimed the territory as part of the <a>Kingdom of France</a>'s colony of <a>New France</a>. After the <a>Kingdom of Great Britain</a> began to settle colonies to the south along the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe. After being defeated in 1763 in the <a>Seven Years' War</a>, France ceded its territory east of the <a>Mississippi River</a> to Great Britain.

</p>
<p>
Thereafter, the nearby British <a>Thirteen Colonies</a>, especially the provinces of <a>New Hampshire</a> and <a>New York</a>, disputed the extent of the area called the <a>New Hampshire Grants</a> to the west of the <a>Connecticut River</a>, encompassing present-day Vermont. The provincial government of New York sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants from the government of New Hampshire. The <a>Green Mountain Boys</a> militia protected the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the newly arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York. Ultimately, a group of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the <a>Vermont Republic</a> in 1777 as an independent state during the <a>American Revolutionary War</a>. The Vermont Republic <a>abolished slavery</a> before any of the other states.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Vermont was <a>admitted</a> to the newly established United States as the fourteenth state in 1791. During the mid-19th century, Vermont was a strong source of <a>abolitionist</a> sentiment, although it was also tied to <a>King Cotton</a> through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied on southern cotton. It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate in the <a>American Civil War</a>.

</p>
<p>
The geography of the state is marked by the <a>Green Mountains</a>, which run north–south up the middle of the state, separating <a>Lake Champlain</a> and other valley terrain on the west from the <a>Connecticut River valley</a> that defines much of its eastern border. A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its open land is devoted to agriculture. The state's climate is characterized by warm, humid summers and cold, snowy winters.

</p>
<p>
Vermont's economic activity of $34 billion in 2018 ranked last on the <a>list of U.S. states and territories by GDP</a> but 34th in GDP per capita. In 2000, the state legislature was the first to recognize <a>civil unions</a> for same-sex couples.

<p>
<a>Samuel de Champlain</a> claimed the area around what is now <a>Lake Champlain</a>, giving the name <i>Vert Mont</i> (Green Mountain) to the region he found, on a 1647 map.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Evidence suggests that this name came into use among English settlers, before it morphed to "Vermont", ca. 1760.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> In 1777, <a>Thomas Young</a> introduced the name in writing with a broadside "To the Inhabitants of Vermont, a Free and Independent State".<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Native_American">Native American</h3>
<p>
Between 8500 and 7000 <a>BCE</a>, at the time of the <a>Champlain Sea</a>, <a>Native Americans</a> inhabited and hunted in present-day Vermont. During the <a>Archaic period</a>, from the 8th millennium BCE to 1000 BCE, Native Americans migrated year-round. During the <a>Woodland period</a>, from 1000 BCE to 1600 CE, they established villages and trade networks, and developed ceramic and <a>bow and arrow</a> technology. Their population in 1500 CE was estimated to be around 10,000 people.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During colonial times, where encounters and settlement were initiated by French colonists, the territory was occupied mainly by an <a>Abenaki</a> tribe known as the <a>Sokoki</a>, or Missisquois. The eastern part of the state may have also been occupied by the <a>Androscoggin</a> and <a>Pennacook</a> peoples.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
To the west, the Missisquois competed with the Iroquoian <a>Mohawk</a>, based in the Mohawk valley but with a large territory, and the Algonquin <a>Mohican</a> peoples.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> Many of the tribes later formed the <a>Wabanaki Confederacy</a> during <a>King Philip's War</a>. The warfare by English colonists defeated and scattered most of the surviving Abenaki tribes.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>
The first European to see Vermont is thought to have been French explorer <a>Jacques Cartier</a> in 1535. On July 30, 1609, <a>French explorer</a><a>Samuel de Champlain</a>  claimed this territory as part of <a>New France</a>. In 1666, French settlers erected <a>Fort Sainte Anne</a> on <a>Isle La Motte</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> the first European settlement in Vermont.

</p>
<p>
The "violent" <a>1638 New Hampshire earthquake</a> was centered in the St. Lawrence Valley and reported throughout New England. This was the first seismic event noted in Vermont.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> In 1690, a group of Dutch-British settlers from <a>Albany</a> established a settlement and trading post at <a>Chimney Point</a>, 8 miles (13 km) west of present-day <a>Addison</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> During <a>Dummer's War</a>, the first permanent English settlement was established in 1724 with the construction of <a>Fort Dummer</a>. It was intended to protect the nearby settlements of <a>Dummerston</a> and <a>Brattleboro</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
From 1731 to 1734, the French constructed <a>Fort St. Frédéric</a>, which gave them control of the New France–Vermont frontier region in the Lake Champlain Valley. With the outbreak of the <a>French and Indian War</a> in 1754, the North American front of the <a>Seven Years' War</a> between the French and British, the French began construction in 1755 of <a>Fort Carillon</a> at present-day <a>Ticonderoga, New York</a>. The British failed to take either fort between 1755 and 1758. In 1759 a combined force of 12,000 British regular and provincial troops under Sir <a>Jeffery Amherst</a><a>captured Carillon</a> , after which the French abandoned Fort St. Frédéric. Amherst constructed <a>Fort Crown Point</a> next to the remains of the Fort St. Frédéric, securing British control over the area.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
Following France's loss in the French and Indian War, through the <a>1763 Treaty of Paris</a>, it ceded control of land east of the Mississippi River to the British. The Crown attempted to <a>limit colonial settlement</a> to lands east of the Appalachians, in order to prohibit encroachment on Native American lands. The territory of Vermont was divided nearly in half in a jagged line running from <a>Fort William Henry</a> in <a>Lake George</a> diagonally north-eastward to <a>Lake Memphremagog</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> With the end of the war, new settlers arrived in Vermont. Ultimately, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York all claimed this frontier area.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
On July 20, 1764, <a>King George III</a> established the boundary between <a>New Hampshire</a> and <a>New York</a> along the west bank of the <a>Connecticut River</a>, north of <a>Massachusetts</a>, and south of <a>45 degrees north latitude</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><a>New York</a>  refused to recognize the land titles known as the <a>New Hampshire Grants</a> (towns created by land grants sold by New Hampshire Governor <a>Benning Wentworth</a>) and dissatisfied New Hampshire settlers organized in opposition. In 1770 <a>Ethan Allen</a>, his brothers <a>Ira</a> and Levi, and the Allens' cousins <a>Seth Warner</a> and Remember Baker, recruited an informal militia known as the <a>Green Mountain Boys</a> to protect the interests of the original New Hampshire settlers against newcomers from New York.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1775, after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, the Green Mountain Boys assisted a force from Connecticut, led by Benedict Arnold, in capturing the British fort at Ticonderoga. Thereafter, the Continental Congress in Philadelphia directed the New York colony's revolutionary congress to fund and equip Allen's militia as a ranger regiment of the Continental Army, which it did. Seth Warner was chosen by the men of the regiment to lead, while Ethan Allen later served as a colonel in Schuyler's Army of Northern New York.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>

<p>
On January 15, 1777, representatives of the New Hampshire Grants declared the independence of <a>Vermont</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> For the first six months of its existence, it was called the Republic of New Connecticut.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On June 2, 1777, a second convention of 72 delegates met and adopted the name "Vermont." This was on the advice of a friendly Pennsylvanian, Dr. <a>Thomas Young</a>, friend and mentor of <a>Ethan Allen</a>. He was advising them on how to achieve admission into the newly independent United States of America as the 14th state.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> On July 4, they completed the drafting of the <a>Constitution of Vermont</a> at the <a>Windsor Tavern</a>, and adopted it on July 8. This was the first written constitution in North America to ban adult <a>slavery</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> saying <a>male slaves become free at the age of 21 and females at 18</a>. It provided for universal adult male suffrage and required support of public schools. It was in effect from 1777 to 1786.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>
The Battle of Bennington, fought on August 16, 1777, was a seminal event in the history of the state of Vermont and the United States. A combined American force, under General <a>John Stark</a>'s command, attacked the <a>Hessian</a> column at <a>Hoosick, New York</a>, just across the border from Bennington. It killed or captured virtually the entire Hessian detachment. General <a>Burgoyne</a> never recovered from this loss and eventually surrendered the remainder of his 6,000-man force at <a>Saratoga, New York</a>, on October 17 that year.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The battles of <a>Bennington</a> and <a>Saratoga</a> together are recognized as the turning point in the Revolutionary War because they were the first major defeat of a British army. The anniversary of the battle is still celebrated in Vermont as a legal holiday.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Battle of Hubbardton</a> (July 7, 1777) was the only Revolutionary <a>battle within the present boundaries of Vermont</a>. Although the Continental forces were technically defeated, the British forces were damaged to the point that they did not pursue the Americans (retreating from Fort Ticonderoga) any further.

<p>
Vermont continued to govern itself as a sovereign entity based in the eastern town of Windsor for 14 years. The independent state of Vermont issued its own coinage from 1785 to 1788<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> and operated a national postal service. <a>Thomas Chittenden</a> was the Governor in 1778–89 and in 1790–91.

</p>
<p>
Because the state of New York continued to assert a disputed claim that Vermont was a part of New York, Vermont could not be <a>admitted to the Union</a> under Article IV, Section<span></span>3 of the Constitution until the legislature of New York consented. On March 6, 1790, the legislature made its consent contingent upon a negotiated agreement on the precise boundary between the two states. When commissioners from New York and Vermont met to decide on the boundary, Vermont's negotiators insisted on also settling the property ownership disputes with New Yorkers, rather than leaving that to be decided later in a federal court.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The negotiations were successfully concluded in October 1790 with an agreement that Vermont would pay $30,000 to New York to be distributed among New Yorkers who claimed land in Vermont under New York land patents.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> In January 1791, a convention in Vermont voted 105–4<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> to petition Congress to become a state in the federal union. Congress acted on February 18, 1791, to admit Vermont to the Union as the 14th state as of March 4, 1791.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> Vermont became the first to enter the Union after the original 13 states.

</p>
<p>
The revised constitution of 1786, which established a greater separation of powers, continued in effect until 1793, two years after Vermont's <a>admission to the Union</a>.

</p>
<p>
Under the Act "To Secure Freedom to All Persons Within This State,"<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> slavery was officially banned by state law on November 25, 1858, less than three years before the <a>American Civil War</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> Vermonters provided refuge in several sites for escaped slaves, fleeing to Canada, as part of what was called the <a>Underground Railroad</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>
From the mid-1850s on, some Vermonters became activists opposing <a>slavery</a>, which they had previously worked to contain in the South. <a>Abolitionist</a><a>Thaddeus Stevens</a>  was born in Vermont and later represented a district in Pennsylvania in Congress. He developed as a national leader and later promoted <a>Radical Republican</a> goals after the <a>American Civil War</a>. While the Whig Party shriveled, and the <a>Republican Party</a> emerged, Vermont supported Republican candidates. In 1860 it voted for <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>, giving him the largest margin of victory of any state.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the <a>American Civil War</a>, Vermont sent 33,288 men into United States service. 5,224 Vermonters (more than 15 percent) were killed.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The northernmost land action of the war was the <a>St. Albans Raid</a>—the robbery of three St. Albans banks, perpetrated in October 1864 by 21 Confederate agents. A posse pursued the Confederate raiders into Canada and captured several of them. They had to turn their captives over to Canadian officials. Canada reimbursed the banks, released, and later re-arrested some of the perpetrators.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Postbellum_era%20to%20present">Postbellum era to present</h3>
<p>
As English speakers came to dominate the population in Vermont, they anglicized the names of many ethnic French residents and often discriminated against them. In the mid-20th century, descendants began to reclaim their French names, especially surnames.

</p>
<p>
Beginning in the mid-19th century, Vermont industries attracted numerous <a>Irish</a>, <a>Scots-Irish</a> and <a>Italian</a><a>immigrants</a> , adding to its residents of mostly <a>English</a> and some <a>French-Canadian</a> ancestry. Many of the immigrants migrated to <a>Barre</a>, where the men worked as stonecutters of <a>granite</a>, for which there was a national market. Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states.

</p>
<p>
In this period, many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses to support their families. Such facilities also helped absorb new residents and help them learn the new culture; European immigrants peaked in number between 1890 and 1900. Typically immigrants boarded with people of their own language and ethnicity, but sometimes they boarded with others.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Gradually the new immigrants were absorbed into the state. Times of tension aroused divisions. In the early 20th century, some people in Vermont became alarmed about what they considered to be a decline in rural areas; people left farming to move to cities and others seemed unable to fit within society. In addition, there was a wave of immigration by French Canadians, and those of Protestant Yankee stock feared being overtaken by the new people, who added to the Catholic population of Irish and Italians. Based on the colonial past, some Yankee residents considered the French Canadians to have intermarried too frequently with Native Americans.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In an era influenced by ideas of <a>Social Darwinism</a>, some Vermont leaders promoted <a>eugenics</a>, an idea that the population could be managed and improved by limiting marriage and reproduction by certain members classified as unfit or defective. It passed a marriage law, to limit marriage by people considered unfit. In 1915 the <a>Brandon State School</a> opened, the beginning of a related effort to segregate and control those judged unfit to reproduce.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state followed efforts to improve children's welfare by establishing other institutions to house the mentally ill or disabled. From 1925 to 1928 the <a>Eugenics Survey of Vermont</a> conducted research and recorded the histories of families it determined were degenerate or dependent. It also attempted to educate the public about why restrictive measures, including voluntary sterilization, were desirable. Review by current historians reveals the results were socially prejudiced, as the surveys tended to target the poor and disenfranchised minorities, including French Canadians, Abenaki, and disabled.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1931 Vermont was the 29th state to pass a eugenics law. Vermont like other states, sterilized some patients in institutions and persons it had identified through surveys as degenerate or unfit. It nominally had permission from the patients or their guardians, but abuses have been documented. Two-thirds of the sterilizations were done on women, and poor, unwed mothers were targeted, among others. The surgery was performed at institutions and hospitals in the state supposedly devoted to care of people in need. There is disagreement about how many sterilizations were performed; most were completed from 1931 to 1941, but such procedures were recorded as late as 1970.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the increased intensity and flooding caused by <a>climate change</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> the state has suffered several extreme natural disasters in the 20th and 21st centuries related to hurricanes, and extensive rain and flooding.

</p>
<p>
Large-scale <a>flooding</a> occurred in early November 1927. During this incident, 84 people died, including the <a>state's lieutenant governor</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>1938 New England hurricane</a> in the fall of that year blew down 15,000,000 acres (61,000 km<sup>2</sup>) of trees, one-third of the total forest at the time in New England. Three billion board feet were salvaged. Today many of the older trees in Vermont are about 75 years old, dating from after this storm.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A major flood occurred in 1973, causing the deaths of two people and millions of dollars in property damage.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state suffered severe flooding in late August 2011 caused by <a>Tropical Storm Irene</a>. Heavy rains caused flooding in many towns built along narrow river valleys. The governor described it as one of the worst natural disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries, second only to the flood of 1927. The state was classified as a federal disaster area.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>

Vermont approved women's suffrage decades before it became part of the national constitution. Women were first allowed to vote in the elections of December 18, 1880, when women were granted limited <a>suffrage</a>. They were first allowed to vote in town elections, and later in state legislative races.

</p>
<p>
In 1964, the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> decision in <i><a>Reynolds v. Sims</a></i> required "<a>one man, one vote</a>" redistricting in all states. It had found that many state legislatures had not redistricted and were unjustly dominated by rural interests, years after the development of densely populated and industrial urban areas. In addition, it found that many states had an upper house based on geographical jurisdictions, such as counties. This gave disproportionate power to rural and lightly populated counties. The court ruled there was no basis for such a structure. Major changes in political apportionment took place in Vermont and other affected states.

</p>
<p>
This ruling required districts to be reassessed after every census and to be based on roughly equal population, rather than geography (such as counties). Under redistricting, residents in urban areas were to gain an equitable share of apportionment in both houses in every state. Vermont and some other northern states had long been dominated by rural districts, as were several Southern states in those years, who had not redistricted since the turn of the century.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> Until that time, apportionment of upper houses was often based on county jurisdictions, which had given more power to rural counties and failed to acknowledge the increased population in urban areas. This arrangement had meant that urban areas did not have proportionate political power and often suffered from underinvestment in needed infrastructure; other urban issues were also neglected by rural-dominated legislatures.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>

In July 2000, Vermont became the first state to introduce <a>civil unions</a>. In 2009, Vermont became the first state to legalize <a>same-sex marriage</a>, unforced by court challenge or ruling.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>

Since the late 20th century, Abenaki peoples in Vermont lobbied for recognition. In 2011 the state officially recognized their continued presence in the region by recognizing the Elnu Tribe of the Abenaki and the Nulhegan Band of the Coosuk Abenaki Nation; in 2012 it recognized the Abenaki Nation of Missisquoi and the Koasek Traditional Band of the Koos Abenaki Nation. In 2016 the state governor proclaimed Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples Day.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On January 22, 2018, Vermont became the first of the United States to legalize <a>cannabis</a> for recreational use by legislative action, and the ninth state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. This law was signed by Republican Governor <a>Phil Scott</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>

Vermont is located in the <a>New England</a> region of the <a>northeastern United States</a> and comprises 9,614 square miles (24,900 km<sup>2</sup>), making it the 45th-largest state. It is the only state that <a>does not have any buildings taller than 124 feet (38 m)</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> Land comprises 9,250 square miles (24,000 km<sup>2</sup>) and water comprises 365 square miles (950 km<sup>2</sup>), making it the 43rd-largest in land area and the 47th in water area. In total area, it is larger than <a>El Salvador</a> and smaller than <a>Haiti</a>. It is the only landlocked state in New England, and it is the easternmost and the smallest in area of all landlocked states.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Green Mountains</a> in Vermont form a north–south spine running most of the length of the state, slightly west of its center. In the southwest portion of the state are located the <a>Taconic Mountains</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> In the northwest, near <a>Lake Champlain</a>, is the fertile <a>Champlain Valley</a>. In the south of the valley is <a>Lake Bomoseen</a>.

</p>
<p>
The west bank of the <a>Connecticut River</a> marks the state's eastern border with New Hampshire, though much of the river flows within New Hampshire's territory.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> 41% of Vermont's land area is part of the Connecticut River's watershed.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Lake Champlain</a>, the sixth-largest body of fresh water in the United States, separates Vermont from New York in the northwest portion of the state. From north to south, Vermont is 159 miles (256 km) long. Its greatest width, from east to west, is 89 miles (143 km) at the Canada–U.S. border; the narrowest width is 37 miles (60 km) near the Massachusetts border. The width averages 60.5 miles (97.4 km). The state's <a>geographic center</a> is approximately three miles (5 km) east of <a>Roxbury</a>, in <a>Washington County</a>. There are <a>fifteen U.S. federal border crossings between Vermont and Canada</a>.

</p>
<p>
Several mountains have timberlines with delicate year-round alpine ecosystems, including <a>Mount Mansfield</a>, the highest mountain in the state; <a>Killington Peak</a>, the second-highest; <a>Camel's Hump</a>, the state's third-highest; and <a>Mount Abraham</a>, the fifth-highest peak.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> Areas in Vermont administered by the <a>National Park Service</a> include the <a>Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park</a> (in <a>Woodstock</a>) and the <a>Appalachian National Scenic Trail</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>

<p>
The rural northeastern section known as the "<a>Northeast Kingdom</a>" often averages 10 °F (5.6 °C) colder than the southern areas of the state during winter. The annual snowfall averages between 60 and 100 inches (1,500 and 2,500 mm) depending on elevation. Vermont is the seventh coldest state in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>

<a>Climate change in Vermont</a> encompasses the <a>effects of climate change</a>, attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric <a>carbon dioxide</a>, in the U.S. state of Vermont.

</p>
<p>
The state is already seeing effects of climate change that affect its ecosystems, economy and public health. According to the Vermont state government, rainfall has significantly increased in the last 50 years, storms and flooding have increased, and winters have become warmer and shorter.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> These changes have led to significant impacts on both the winter tourism industry,<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> and a decline in critical agricultural and woodland industries like <a>maple sugaring</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state openly acknowledges and is developing programs that respond to <a>global warming</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> Vermont was one of the first states in the United States to adopt <a>greenhouse gas emissions</a> goals in 2006.

<p>
There are five distinct <a>physiographic</a> regions of Vermont.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> Categorized by geological and physical attributes, they are the Northeastern Highlands, the Green Mountains, the <a>Taconic Mountains</a>, the Champlain Lowlands, and the Vermont Piedmont.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
About 500 million years ago, Vermont was part of <a>Laurentia</a> and located in the tropics.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup> The central and southern Green Mountain range include the oldest rocks in Vermont, formed about one billion years ago during the first mountain building period (or orogeny). Subsequently, about <span>400 million</span> years ago, the second mountain building period created Green Mountain peaks that were 15,000–20,000 feet (4,600–6,100 m) tall, three to four times their current height and comparable to the <a>Himalayas</a>. The geological pressures that created those peaks remain evident as the <a>Champlain Thrust</a>, running north–south to the west of the mountains (now the eastern shore of Lake Champlain). It is an example of geological fault thrusting where bedrock is pushed over the newer rock formation.

</p>
<p>
As a result of tectonic formation, Vermont east of the Green Mountains tends to be formed from rocks produced in the <a>Silurian</a> and <a>Devonian</a> periods, and western Vermont mainly from the older <a>Pre-Cambrian</a> and <a>Cambrian</a> material.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup> Several large deposits within the state contain granite.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> The remains of the <a>Chazy Formation</a> can be observed in <a>Isle La Motte</a>. It was one of the first tropical reefs. It is the site of the limestone Fisk Quarry, which contains a collection of ancient marine fossils, such as <a>stromatoporoids</a>, that date to <span>200 million</span> years ago. At one point, Vermont is believed to have been connected to Africa (<a>Pangaea</a>); the fossils found and the rock formations found on the coasts in both Africa and America are evidence affirming the Pangaea theory.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the past four centuries, Vermont has experienced a few earthquakes, rarely centered under the state. The highest ranked, in 1952, had a <a>Richter magnitude scale</a> 6.0 and was based in Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>
The state contains 41 species of <a>reptiles</a> and <a>amphibians</a>, 89 species of <a>fish</a>, of which 12 are non native;<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> 193 species of breeding birds, 58 species of mammals, more than 15,000 insect species, and 2,000 higher plant species, plus fungi, algae, and 75 different types of natural communities.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> Vermont contains one species of venomous snake, the <a>timber rattlesnake</a>, which is confined to a few acres in western <a>Rutland County</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Wildlife has suffered because of human development of the state. By the mid-19th century, <a>wild turkeys</a> were exterminated in the state through <a>overhunting</a> and <a>destruction of habitat</a>. Sixteen were re-introduced in 1969, and had grown to a flock estimated to number 45,000 in 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> In 2013, hunters killed 6,968 of these.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> Since 1970, reduction of farmland has resulted in reduced environment for, and resulted in a decline in numbers of various <a>shrubland</a> birds, including the <a>American woodcock</a>, <a>brown thrasher</a>, <a>eastern towhee</a>, <a>willow flycatcher</a>, <a>golden-winged warbler</a>, <a>blue-winged warbler</a>, <a>field sparrow</a>, and <a>Baltimore oriole</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The use of <a>DDT</a> for insect control resulted in <a>ospreys</a> laying eggs that were too thin to support the development of young. This species disappeared from the state. It began to reappear in 1998, when ospreys were observed again locally. As of 2010, they were no longer endangered in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
From 2008 to 2010, <a>White-nose syndrome</a> killed an estimated two-thirds of all cave-wintering bats in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>New England cottontail</a> disappeared from the state in the early 1970s, out-competed by the <a>eastern cottontail rabbit</a>, imported in the 1800s for hunting. It is better able to detect and avoid predators.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Out of a total of 33 species of <a>bumblebee</a>, by 2013 the number declined to 19 or 20 species in the state. <i><a>Bombus terricola</a></i> (the yellow-banded bumblebee), although once common in Vermont, has not been seen in most of its range since 1999 and is now absent from the state.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> For honey bees, <a>colony collapse disorder</a> has affected bee population in the state, as elsewhere.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Invasive species included the Asian <a>spotted-wing drosophila</a>, which started damaging berry crops in 2012. Vermont was the initial point of invasion in New England.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Since 2010, the Vermont Department of Health has worked with the <a>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> to conduct blood serum surveys of the state's <a>deer</a> and <a>moose</a> populations. Tests for <a>eastern equine encephalitis virus</a><a>antibodies</a>  were positive in moose or deer in each of Vermont's counties. In 2012, 12% of deer and 2.4% of moose tested positive.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>
Vermont is in the <a>temperate broadleaf and mixed forests</a><a>biome</a> . Much of the state, in particular the Green Mountains, is covered by the <a>conifers</a> and <a>northern hardwoods</a> of the <a>New England-Acadian forests</a>. The western border with New York and the area around Lake Champlain lies within the <a>Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests</a>. The southwest corner of the state and parts of the Connecticut River are covered by <a>northeastern coastal forests</a> of mixed <a>oak</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Invasive <a>wild honeysuckle</a> has been deemed a threat to the state's forests, native species of plants, and wildlife.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> Many of Vermont's rivers, including the <a>Winooski River</a>, have been subjected to man-made barriers to prevent flooding.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Climate change</a> appears to be affecting the maple sugar industry. <a>Sugar maples</a> have been subject to stress by <a>acid rain</a>, <a>asian longhorn beetles</a>, and <a>pear thrips</a>. In 2011 the deer herd had grown too large for habitat, and many resorted to eating bark to survive the winter, destroying trees in the process. In addition, the sugar maples need a certain period of cold to produce sap for maple syrup. The time to tap these trees has shrunk to one week in some years. The tree may be replaced by the more aggressive <a>Norway maples</a>, in effect forcing the sugar maples to "migrate" north to Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup>

As of 2014, 51.3% of Vermont's population was born in the state (compared with 58.7% for the United States).<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> The changing demographics between those with multi-generational ties to the state and those who are newcomers, bringing different values with them, has resulted in a degree of tension between the two perspectives. This tension is expressed in the terms, "Woodchuck", being applied to those established in the state, and "Flatlander", applied to the newcomers.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup>
Vermont is the least populous New England state. As of 2012, Vermont was one of only two states in the U.S. with fewer people than the <a>District of Columbia</a> (<a>Wyoming</a> was the other).<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>

According to the <a>Pew Research Center</a> in 2014, 37% reported no religion, the highest rate of irreligion of all U.S. states.<sup><a href="#ref_127">[127]</a></sup> The Pew Research Center also determined the largest religion was <a>Christianity</a>;<sup><a href="#ref_128">[128]</a></sup><a>Catholics</a>  made 22% of the population and <a>Protestants</a> were 30%. In contrast with <a>Southern U.S.</a> trends, the majority of Protestants are <a>Mainline Protestant</a> dominated by <a>Methodism</a>. The <a>United Methodist Church</a> was the largest Mainline Protestant denomination in Vermont, followed by the <a>American Baptist Churches USA</a> and <a>United Church of Christ</a>.

<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_dairy_industry">Vermont dairy industry</a></div>
<p>
<a>Dairy farming</a> is the primary source of agricultural income. In the second half of the 20th century, developers had plans to build <a>condos</a> and houses on what was relatively inexpensive, open land. Vermont's government responded with a series of laws <a>controlling development</a> and with some pioneering initiatives to prevent the loss of Vermont's dairy industry. Still, the number of Vermont dairy farms has declined more than 85% from the 11,206 dairy farms operating in 1947. In 2003 there were fewer than 1,500 dairy farms in the state; in 2006 there were 1,138; in 2019 there were 658.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup> The number of dairy farms has been diminishing by 10% annually.<sup><a href="#ref_154">[154]</a></sup> 80% of open land is controlled by dairy farms.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The number of <a>cattle</a> in Vermont had declined by 40%; however, milk production has doubled in the same period due to tripling the production per cow.<sup><a href="#ref_155">[155]</a></sup> While milk production rose, Vermont's <a>market share</a> declined. Within a group of states supplying the <a>Boston</a> and <a>New York City</a> markets (called "Federal order Class I"),<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup> Vermont was third in market share, with 10.6%; New York has 44.9% and Pennsylvania has 32.9%.<sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup> In 2007 dairy farmers received a record $23.60 for 100 pounds (45 kg) (11.63 gallons at $2.03/gallon) of milk. This dropped in 2008 to $17 ($1.46/gallon).<sup><a href="#ref_158">[158]</a></sup> The average dairy farm produced <span>1.3 million</span> pounds of milk annually in 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_159">[159]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The dairy barn remains an iconic image of Vermont, but the 87% decrease in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003<sup><a href="#ref_160">[160]</a></sup> means that preservation of the dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy. The Vermont Barn Census, organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit state and local historic preservation programs, has developed educational and administrative systems for recording the number, condition, and features of barns throughout Vermont.<sup><a href="#ref_161">[161]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2009, there were 543 <a>organic farms</a>. Twenty percent of the dairy farms were organic and 23% (128) vegetable farms were organic. Organic farming increased in 2006–07, but leveled off in 2008–09.<sup><a href="#ref_162">[162]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A significant amount of milk is shipped into the Boston market. Therefore the Commonwealth of <a>Massachusetts</a> certifies that Vermont farms meet Massachusetts sanitary standards. Without this certification, a farmer may not sell milk for distribution into the bulk market.<sup><a href="#ref_163">[163]</a></sup> In 2019, two-thirds of all milk in New England was produced by Vermont dairies.<sup><a href="#ref_153">[153]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Forest products have always been a staple to the economy, comprising 1% of the total gross state output and 9% of total manufacturing as of 2013.<sup><a href="#ref_164">[164]</a></sup> In 2007, <a>Windham County</a> contained the largest concentration of kilns for drying lumber east of the <a>Mississippi River</a>. The decline of farms has resulted in a regrowth of Vermont's forests due to <a>ecological succession</a>. Today, most of Vermont's forests are <a>secondary</a>. The state and <a>non-profit organizations</a> are actively encouraging regrowth and careful forest management. Over 78% of the land area of the state is forested compared to only 37% in the 1880s, when sheep farming was at its peak and large amounts of acreage were cleared for grazing.<sup><a href="#ref_165">[165]</a></sup> Over 85% of that area is non-industrial, private forestland owned by individuals or families. In 2013, 73,054 million cubic feet (2,068.7 million cubic meters) of wood was harvested in Vermont.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup> A large amount of Vermont forest products are exports with 21,504 million feet (6.554<span>×</span>10<sup>9</sup> meters) being shipped overseas plus an additional 16,384 million cubic feet (463.9 million cubic meters) to Canada.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup> Most of it was processed within the state. In this century the manufacture of wood products has fallen by almost half. The annual net growth has been estimated at 172,810 million cubic feet (4,893 million cubic meters).<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup> The <a>USDA</a> estimates that 8,584 billion cubic feet (243.1 billion cubic meters) remain in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_166">[166]</a></sup> Forest products also add to carbon sequestration since lumber and timber used in houses and furniture hold carbon for long periods of time while the trees that were removed are replaced overtime with new growing stock.<sup><a href="#ref_167">[167]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2017, the price of wood products had either plummeted or remained the same when compared to previous decades, which meant there was cause for concern with jobs in the industry. For example, in 1994, the price of a thousand board feet was $300, the same as it was in 2017. The price of wood chips has halved in the same time frame. In 1980, the price for a cord of wood was $50; in 2017, $25. For lack of demand, Vermont's forests are growing twice as fast as they are being cut.<sup><a href="#ref_168">[168]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
An important and growing part of Vermont's economy is the manufacture and sale of artisan foods, fancy foods, and novelty items trading in part upon the Vermont "brand," which the state manages and defends. Examples of these specialty exports include <a>Cabot Cheese</a>, the <a>Vermont Teddy Bear Company</a>, <a>Fine Paints of Europe</a>, <a>Vermont Butter and Cheese Company</a>, several <a>microbreweries</a>, ginseng growers, <a>Burton Snowboards</a>, <a>King Arthur Flour</a>, and <a>Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream</a>.

Vermont has no fossil-fuel reserves, however its forest products industry provides fuel for electricity generation and home heating. Electricity consumption per capita ranks it among the lowest 20% of states, and total electricity consumption was the lowest in the United States. Vermont consumed three times more electricity than it generated in-state in 2019, and imported its largest share of electricity from Canada. Vermont's 99.9% share of in-state electricity generation from renewable sources was the highest among all 50 states.<sup><a href="#ref_176">[176]</a></sup>

<p>
Because housing prices did not rise much during the early 2000s, the collapse in real estate values was not that precipitous either. While foreclosure rose significantly in 2007, the state stood 50th—the most favorable—in ratio of foreclosure filings to households.<sup><a href="#ref_180">[180]</a></sup> While housing sales dropped annually from 2004 to 2008, prices continued to rise.<sup><a href="#ref_181">[181]</a></sup>

<a>Captive insurance</a> plays an increasingly large role in Vermont's economy. With this form of alternative insurance, large corporations or industry associations form standalone insurance companies to insure their own risks, thereby substantially reducing their insurance premiums and gaining a significant measure of control over types of risks to be covered. There are also significant tax advantages to be gained from the formation and operation of captive insurance companies. According to the Insurance Information Institute, Vermont in 2009 was the world's third-largest domicile for captive insurance companies, following <a>Bermuda</a> and the <a>Cayman Islands</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_194">[194]</a></sup> In 2009, there were 560 such companies.<sup><a href="#ref_195">[195]</a></sup> In 2010, the state had 900 such companies.<sup><a href="#ref_196">[196]</a></sup>

In winter, Nordic and backcountry skiers visit to travel the length of the state on the <a>Catamount Trail</a>. Several <a>horse shows</a> are annual events. Vermont's state parks, historic sites, museums, golf courses, and new boutique hotels with spas were designed to attract tourists.

</p>
<p>
In 2000–01, there were 4,579,719 skier and snowboarder visits to the state. There were 4,125,082 visits in 2009–2010, a rise from recent years.<sup><a href="#ref_207">[207]</a></sup>

<p>
The towns of <a>Rutland</a> and <a>Barre</a> are the traditional centers of marble and granite quarrying and carving in the U.S. For many years Vermont was also the headquarters of the smallest union in the U.S., the Stonecutters Association, of about 500 members. The first marble quarry in America was on <a>Mount Aeolus</a> overlooking <a>East Dorset</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_209">[209]</a></sup> The granite industry attracted numerous skilled stonecutters in the late 19th century from Italy, Scotland, and Ireland. Barre is the location of the <a>Rock of Ages quarry</a>, the largest <a>dimension stone</a> granite quarry in the United States. Vermont is the largest producer of slate in the country. The highest quarrying revenues result from the production of dimension stone.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The Rock of Ages quarry in <a>Barre</a> is one of the leading exporters of granite in the country. The work of the sculptors of this corporation can be seen 3 miles (4.8 km) down the road at the Hope Cemetery, where there are gravestones and mausoleums.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

Vermont was named the nation's smartest state in 2005 and 2006.<sup><a href="#ref_212">[212]</a></sup> In 2006, there was a gap between state testing standards and national, which is biased in favor of the state standards by 30%, on average. This puts Vermont 11th-best in the nation. Most states have a higher bias.<sup><a href="#ref_213">[213]</a></sup> However, when allowance for race is considered, a 2007 U.S. Government list of test scores shows Vermont white fourth graders performed 25th in the nation for reading (229) and 26th for math (247).<sup><a href="#ref_214">[214]</a></sup> White eighth graders scored 18th for math (292) and 12th for reading (273). The first three scores were not considered statistically different from average. White eighth graders scored significantly above average in reading. Statistics for black students were not reliable because of their small representation in the testing.

Vermont's main mode of travel is by automobile. 5.7% of Vermont households did not own a car in 2008.<sup><a href="#ref_220">[220]</a></sup> In 2012, there were 605,000 motor vehicles registered, nearly one car for every person in the state. This is similar to average car ownership nationwide.<sup><a href="#ref_221">[221]</a></sup> In 2012, about half the <a>carbon emissions</a> in the state resulted from vehicles.<sup><a href="#ref_222">[222]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2007, Vermont was ranked the third safest state for highway fatalities.<sup><a href="#ref_223">[223]</a></sup> One third of these fatal crashes involved a drunken driver.<sup><a href="#ref_224">[224]</a></sup> On average, 20–25 people die each year from drunk driving incidents, and 70–80 people are in fatal car crashes in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_225">[225]</a></sup> In northern Vermont particularly, moose are not uncommon, including in urban areas.<sup><a href="#ref_226">[226]</a></sup> They constitute a traffic threat since they are unaware of vehicles. There are several deaths each year from automobiles striking moose.

</p>
<p>
In 2009, 93% of Vermont motorists were insured, tying the state with Pennsylvania for the highest percentage.<sup><a href="#ref_227">[227]</a></sup> In 2008, Vermont was the fifth best state for fewest uninsured motorists—6%.<sup><a href="#ref_228">[228]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2010, Vermont owned 2,840 miles (4,570 km) of highway. This was the third smallest quantity among the 50 states. 2.5% of the highways were listed as "congested," the 5th lowest in the country. The highway fatality rate was one per 100,000,000 miles (160,000,000 km), tenth lowest in the nation. The highways cost $28,669 per mile ($17,814/km) to maintain, the 17th highest in the states. 34.4% of its bridges were rated deficient or obsolete, the 8th worst in the nation.<sup><a href="#ref_229">[229]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Individual communities and counties have public transit, but their breadth of coverage is frequently limited. <a>Greyhound Lines</a> services a number of small towns. Two <a>Amtrak</a> trains serve Vermont, the <a><i>Vermonter</i></a><sup><a href="#ref_230">[230]</a></sup> and the <i><a>Ethan Allen Express</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_231">[231]</a></sup> In early 2011, Amtrak evaluated the track used by the <i>Ethan Allen Express</i> between Rutland and Whitehall as the worst in the nation,<sup><a href="#ref_232">[232]</a></sup> but subsequent improvements to the track later in 2011 vastly improved its performance going forward.<sup><a href="#ref_233">[233]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Trucks weighing less than 80,000 pounds (36,000 kg) can use Vermont's interstate highways. The limit for state roads is 99,000 pounds (45,000 kg). This means that vehicles too heavy for the interstates can legally use only secondary roads.<sup><a href="#ref_234">[234]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_235">[235]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1968, Vermont outlawed the use of <a>billboards</a> for advertisement along its roads. It is one of four states in the U.S. to have done this, along with Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska.<sup><a href="#ref_236">[236]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_237">[237]</a></sup>

Vermont is federally represented in the <a>United States Congress</a> by two senators and one representative.

</p>
<p>
The state is governed by a <a>constitution</a> which divides governmental duties into legislative, executive and judicial branches: the <a>Vermont General Assembly</a>, the <a>governor of Vermont</a> and the <a>Vermont Supreme Court</a>. The governorship and the General Assembly serve two-year terms including the governor and 30 senators. There are no <a>term limits</a> for any office. The state capital is in Montpelier.

</p>
<p>
There are three types of incorporated municipalities in Vermont: towns, cities, and villages. Like most of New England, there is slight provision for autonomous county government. Counties and county seats are merely convenient repositories for various government services such as state courts, with several elected officers such as a state's Attorney and sheriff. All county services are directly funded by the state of Vermont. The next effective governmental level below state government are municipalities. Most of these are towns.<sup><a href="#ref_292">[292]</a></sup>

Vermont is the only state in the union not to have a balanced-budget requirement, yet it has had a balanced budget every year since 1991.<sup><a href="#ref_293">[293]</a></sup> In 2007 <a>Moody's</a> gave its top <a>bond credit rating</a> (Aaa) to the state.<sup><a href="#ref_294">[294]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state uses enterprise funds for operations that are similar to private business enterprises. The Vermont Lottery Commission, the Liquor Control Fund, and the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, are the largest of the State's enterprise funds.<sup><a href="#ref_295">[295]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2007, Vermont was the 14th highest out of 50 states and the District of Columbia for state and local taxation, with a per capita load of $3,681. The national average was $3,447.<sup><a href="#ref_296">[296]</a></sup> However, CNNMoney ranked Vermont highest in the nation based on the percentage of per capita income. The rankings showed Vermont had a per capita tax load of $5,387, 14.1% of the per capita income of $38,306.<sup><a href="#ref_297">[297]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Vermont collects a <a>state personal income tax</a> in a <a>progressive structure</a> of five different income brackets, with <a>marginal tax rates</a> ranging from 3.6% to 9.5%. In 2008, the top 1% of Vermont residents provided 30% of the income tax revenue; around 2,000 people had sufficient income to be taxed at the highest marginal rate of 9.5%.<sup><a href="#ref_298">[298]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Vermont's general <a>state sales tax</a> rate is 6%, which is imposed on sales of <a>tangible personal property</a>, amusement charges, fabrication charges, some public utility charges and some service contracts. Some towns and cities impose an additional 1% Local Option Tax. There are 46 <a>exemptions from the sales tax</a>, including exemptions for food, medical items, manufacturing machinery, equipment and fuel, residential fuel and electricity, clothing, and shoes. A <a>use tax</a> is imposed on the buyer at the same rate as the sales tax. The buyer pays the use tax when the seller fails to collect the sales tax or the items are purchased from a source where no tax is collected. The use tax applies to items taxable under the sales tax.

</p>
<p>
Vermont does not collect <a>inheritance taxes</a>, but does impose a <a>state estate tax</a>; a Vermont estate <a>tax return</a> must be filed if the <a>estate</a> must file a federal estate tax return (the requirement for which depends on federal law).<sup><a href="#ref_299">[299]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Vermont does not collect a state <a>gift tax</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_299">[299]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Property taxes</a> are levied by municipalities for the support of education and municipal services. Vermont does not assess tax on <a>personal property</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_300">[300]</a></sup> Property taxes are based on appraisal of the <a>fair market value</a> of real property.<sup><a href="#ref_300">[300]</a></sup> Rates vary from 0.97% on homesteaded property in Ferdinand, Essex County, to 2.72% on nonresidents' property in Barre City.<sup><a href="#ref_301">[301]</a></sup> Statewide, towns average 1.77% to 1.82% tax rate. In 2007, Vermont counties were among the highest in the country for property taxes. Chittenden ($3,809 median), Windham ($3,412), Addison ($3,352), and Windsor ($3,327) ranked in the top 100, out of 1,817 counties in the nation with populations greater than 20,000. Twelve of the state's 14 counties stood in the top 20%.<sup><a href="#ref_302">[302]</a></sup> Median annual property taxes as a percentage of median homeowners income, 5.4%, was rated as the third highest in the nation in 2011.<sup><a href="#ref_303">[303]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_304">[304]</a></sup>

Vermont is one of four states that were once <a>independent</a> nations (Texas, California, and Hawaii are the others). Notably, Vermont is the only state to have voted for a presidential candidate from the <a>Anti-Masonic Party</a>, and Vermont was one of only two states to vote against <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> in all four of his presidential campaigns (the other was <a>Maine</a>).

</p>
<p>
Vermont's history of independent political thought has led to movements for the establishment of the <a>Second Vermont Republic</a> and other plans advocating <a>secession</a>.

</p>
<p>
Vermont is the only state in the United States that requires voters to be sworn in,<sup><a href="#ref_306">[306]</a></sup> having established the <a>voter's oath or affirmation</a> in 1777.

<p>
<a>Republicans</a> dominated local Vermont politics from the party's founding in 1854 until the mid-1970s. Before the 1960s, rural interests dominated the legislature. As a result, cities, particularly the older sections of Burlington and Winooski, were neglected and fell into decay, and people began to move out to newer suburbs.

</p>
<p>
Vermont was for many years a stronghold of the Republican Party. Ethno-political culture of the last century has seen a dramatic shift in voter turnout in the Green Mountain State. Since 1992, Vermont has voted for the <a>Democrat</a> in every Presidential election. Before 1992, Vermont voted for the Republican in every single Presidential election, with the exception of 1964.<sup><a href="#ref_307">[307]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_308">[308]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_309">[309]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_310">[310]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A series of <a>one man, one vote</a> decisions made by the United States Supreme Court in the 1960s required states to redraw their legislative districts to accurately reflect population. As a result, urban areas in Vermont gained political power.

</p>
<p>
The legislature was redistricted under one-person, one-vote in the 1960s. It passed the Land Use and Development Law (<a>Act 250</a>) in 1970, to discourage suburban sprawl and to limit major growth to already developed areas. The law, the first of its kind in the nation, created nine District Environmental Commissions appointed by the Governor, who judged land development and subdivision plans that would have a significant impact on the state's environment and many small communities. As a result of Act 250, Vermont was the last state to get a <a>Wal-Mart</a> (there are now six Wal-Marts in the state, as of November 2017, but only three — in Williston, St. Albans, and Derby — were newly built from the ground up). Because of the successful attempts to dilute what is perceived as the original intent of Act 250,<sup><a href="#ref_311">[311]</a></sup> and other development pressures, Vermont has been designated one of America's most "endangered historic places" by the <a>National Trust for Historic Preservation</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_312">[312]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1995, the state banned the spreading of manure from December 15 to April 1, to prevent run-off and protect the water. Therefore, farms must have environmentally approved facilities to store manure during this time frame.<sup><a href="#ref_313">[313]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
While the state voted largely Democratic, Republican Governor Douglas won all counties but Windham in the 2006 election.

</p>
<p>
A controversy dating from 1999 has been over the adoption of <a>civil unions</a>, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of <a>marriage</a> at the state, but not federal, level. In <i><a>Baker v. Vermont</a></i> (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the <a>Constitution of Vermont</a>, the state must either allow <a>same-sex marriage</a> or provide a "<a>separate, but equal</a>" status for them. The state legislature chose the second option, by creating the institution of <a>civil union</a>; the bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by Governor <a>Howard Dean</a>. In April 2009, the state legislature overrode governor <a>Jim Douglas</a>'s veto to allow same-sex marriage, becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation.<sup><a href="#ref_314">[314]</a></sup> In September 2009, Vermont became the fourth state in which same-sex couples could marry. The previous three were <a>Massachusetts</a>, <a>Connecticut</a>, and <a>Iowa</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 2007, the state's House of Representatives rejected a measure which would have legalized <a>assisted suicide</a> for the terminally ill, by a vote of 82–63. With the governor's signature on May 20, 2013, Vermont became the fourth state to pass a "death with dignity" law — the first to be passed through legislation, rather than by ballot initiative.<sup><a href="#ref_315">[315]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Minor parties and independents flourish. Rules which eliminate smaller parties from the ballot in most states do not exist in Vermont. As a result, voters often have extensive choices for general elections. Among others, this more open policy enabled independents like Bernie Sanders to win election as mayor of Burlington, as a U.S. Congressman, and as a U.S. Senator.

</p>
<p>
A political issue has been <a>Act 60</a>, which balances taxation for education funding. This has resulted in the town of <a>Killington</a> trying to secede from Vermont and join <a>New Hampshire</a>, due to what the locals say is an unfair tax burden.<sup><a href="#ref_316">[316]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_317">[317]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Vermont constitution and the courts supports the right of a person to walk (fish and hunt) on any unposted, unfenced land. That is, trespass must be proven by the owner; it is not automatically assumed.<sup><a href="#ref_318">[318]</a></sup>

<p>
Historically, Vermont was considered one of the most reliably <a>Republican</a> states in the country in terms of national elections. From <a>1856</a> to <a>1988</a>, Vermont voted <a>Democratic</a> only once, in <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a>'s <a>landslide victory</a> of 1964 against <a>Barry M. Goldwater</a>. It was also one of only two states—<a>Maine is the other</a>—where <a>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> was completely shut out in all four of his presidential bids. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Republican presidential candidates frequently won the state with over 70% of the vote.

</p>
<p>
In the 1980s and 1990s, many people moved in from out of state.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_328">[328]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_329">[329]</a></sup> Much of this immigration included the arrival of more liberal political influences of the urban areas of New York and the rest of New England in Vermont.<sup><a href="#ref_328">[328]</a></sup> The brand of Republicanism in Vermont has historically been a moderate one, and combined with the newcomers from out of state, this made Vermont friendlier to Democrats as the national GOP moved to the right. As evidence of this, in 1990 <a>Bernie Sanders</a>, a self-described <a>democratic socialist</a>, was elected to Vermont's <a>lone seat in the House</a> as an independent. Sanders became the state's junior Senator in 2007. However, for his entire career in the House and Senate, Sanders has caucused with the Democrats and is counted as a Democrat for the purposes of committee assignments and voting for party leadership.<sup><a href="#ref_330">[330]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
After narrowly supporting <a>George H. W. Bush</a> in <a>1988</a>, it gave Democrat <a>Bill Clinton</a> a 16-point margin in <a>1992</a>—the first time the state had gone Democratic since 1964. Vermont has voted Democratic in every presidential election since.

</p>
<p>
Since <a>2004</a>, Vermont has been one of the Democrats' most loyal states. It gave <a>John Kerry</a> his fourth-largest margin of victory in the presidential campaign against George W. Bush; he won the state's popular vote by 20 percentage points, taking almost 59% of the vote. (Kerry, from neighboring <a>Massachusetts</a>, also became the first Northern Democrat ever to carry Vermont; Johnson was from <a>Texas</a>, Clinton from <a>Arkansas</a> and <a>Al Gore</a>, triumphant in the Green Mountain State in 2000, from <a>Tennessee</a>.) <a>Essex County</a> in the state's northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont is the only state that did not receive a visit from George W. Bush during his tenure as President of the United States.<sup><a href="#ref_331">[331]</a></sup> Indeed, <a>George W. Bush</a> and <a>Donald Trump</a> are the only Republicans to win the White House without carrying Vermont. In <a>2008</a>, Vermont gave <a>Barack Obama</a> his third-largest margin of victory (37 percentage points) and third-largest vote share in the nation by his winning the state 68% to 31%. Only Obama's birth state of Hawaii and Washington, D.C. were stronger Democratic victories. The same held true in <a>2012</a>, when Obama carried Vermont 67% of the vote to 31% for <a>Romney</a>, and in <a>2016</a>, when <a>Hillary Clinton</a> won with 57% of the vote to 30% for Donald Trump.

</p>
<p>
Vermont's two Senators are Democrat <a>Patrick Leahy</a>, the longest-serving member of the Senate, and independent <a>Bernie Sanders</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_332">[332]</a></sup> The state is represented by an at-large member of the House, Democrat <a>Peter Welch</a>, who succeeded Sanders in 2007.
