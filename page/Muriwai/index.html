Sand and rock (sedimentary), older volcanic material, with many concretions and layers in the cliff walls. A blowhole plays often. The shore platform is also well jointed, with the main rock type being piha conglomerate.

</p>
<p>
Muriwai Beach has <a>black sand</a>, caused by the iron content derived from the ancient volcanoes in the area, including the large <a>Kaipara Volcano</a> which was situated offshore from the Kaipara Heads, and erupted 23-16 million years ago.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The black sand is moved up the west coast of the North Island by longshore drift.
