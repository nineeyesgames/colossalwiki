  <h1 id="Apennines">Apennines</h1>
<div>This article is about the Italian mountain range. For other uses of Apennine, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apennine_(disambiguation)">Apennine (disambiguation)</a>.</div>
<div>Not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennines">Pennines</a>.</div>
<p>
The <b>Apennines</b><sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup> or <b>Apennine Mountains</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˈ</span><span>æ</span><span>p</span><span>ən</span><span>aɪ</span><span>n</span></span>/</a></span></span>; Greek: <span>Ἀπέννινα ὄρη</span> or Ἀπέννινον ὄρος;<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><a>Latin</a> : <i>Appenninus</i> or <i>Apenninus Mons</i> – a singular with plural meaning;<sup><a href="#ref_note 1">[note 1]</a></sup><a>Italian</a> : <i>Appennini</i><small></small><span><a>[appenˈniːni]</a></span> )<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> are a <a>mountain range</a> consisting of parallel smaller chains extending <abbr>c.</abbr><span> 1,200 km (750 mi)</span> along the length of <a>peninsular</a><a>Italy</a> . In the northwest they join with the <a>Ligurian Alps</a> at <a>Altare</a>. In the southwest they end at <a>Reggio di Calabria</a>, the coastal city at the tip of the peninsula. Since 2000 the Environment Ministry of Italy, following the recommendations of the Apennines Park of Europe Project, has been defining the Apennines System to include the mountains of north <a>Sicily</a>, for a total distance of <span>1,500 kilometres (930 mi)</span>.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> The system forms an arc enclosing the east side of the <a>Ligurian</a> and <a>Tyrrhenian Seas</a>.

</p>
<p>
The Apennines conserve some intact ecosystems that have survived human intervention. In these are some of the best preserved forests and montane grasslands in Europe, now protected by <a>national parks</a> and, within them, a high diversity of flora and fauna. These mountains are one of the last refuges of the big European predators such as the <a>Italian wolf</a> and the <a>Marsican brown bear</a>, now extinct in the rest of <a>Central Europe</a>.

</p>
<p>
The mountains lend their name to the <a>Apennine peninsula</a> that forms the major part of Italy.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> They are mostly verdant, although one side of the highest peak, <a>Corno Grande</a>, is partially covered by <a>Calderone glacier</a>, the only <a>glacier</a> in the Apennines.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The eastern slopes down to the <a>Adriatic Sea</a> are steep, while the western slopes form foothills on which most of peninsular Italy's cities are located. The mountains tend to be named from the province or provinces in which they are located; for example, the Ligurian Apennines are in <a>Liguria</a>. As the provincial borders have not always been stable, this practice has resulted in some confusion about exactly where the montane borders are.

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
The etymology most frequently repeated, because of its semantic appropriateness, is that it derives from the <a>Celtic</a><i>penn</i> , "mountain, summit":<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><span><i>A-penn-inus</i>,</span>  which could have been assigned during the Celtic domination of north Italy in the 4th century BC or before. The name originally applied to the north Apennines. However, historical linguists have never found a derivation with which they all agree.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> Wilhelm Deecke said: <span>"[…] its etymology</span> is doubtful but some derive it from the Ligurian-Celtish <i>Pen</i> or <i>Ben</i>, which means mountain peak."<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
A large number of place names seem to reflect <i>pen</i>: Penarrig, Penbrynn, Pencoid, Penmon, Pentir, etc. or <i>ben</i>: Beanach, Benmore, Benabuird, Benan, Bencruachan, etc.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> In one derivation <i>Pen/Ben</i> is cognate with <a>Old Irish</a><i>cenn</i>  "head", but an original <i>*kwen-</i> would be required, which is typologically not found in languages that feature <a>labio-velars</a>. <a>Windisch</a> and <a>Brugmann</a> reconstructed <a>Indo-European</a><i>*kwi-</i> , deriving also the Greek <a>Pindus Mountains</a> from the same root, but <i>*kwen-</i> < <i>*kwi-</i> is not explained by any rule.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> By some, English <a><i>pin</i></a>,<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> as well as <i>pen</i> and Latin <i>pinna</i> or <a><i>penna</i></a> "feather" (in the sense of the horn of the quill)<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> have been connected to the name. This view has the word originating in <a>Latium</a> inconsistently with the theory of the northern origin. None of these derivations are unquestionably accepted.

</p>
<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
The Apennines are divided into three sectors: northern (<i>Appennino settentrionale</i>), central (<i>Appennino centrale</i>), and <span>southern (<i>Appennino meridionale</i>).<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup></span>
</p>
<p>
A number of long hiking trails wind through the Apennines. Of note is <a>European walking route E1</a> coming from northern Europe and traversing the lengths of the northern and central Apennines. The <a>Grand Italian Trail</a> begins in <a>Trieste</a> and after winding through the Alpine arc traverses the entire Apennine system, Sicily and Sardinia.

</p>
<h3 id="Northern_Apennines">Northern Apennines</h3>
<p>
The northern Apennines consist of three <a>subchains</a>: the Ligurian (<i>Appennino ligure</i>), Tuscan-Emilian (<i>Appennino tosco-emiliano</i>), and Umbrian Apennines (<i>Appennino umbro</i>).<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Bocchetta_di_Altare.jpg/220px-Bocchetta_di_Altare.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The Ligurian Apennines border the <a>Ligurian Sea</a> in the <a>Gulf of Genoa</a>, from about <a>Savona</a> below the upper <a>Bormida</a> River valley to about <a>La Spezia</a> (<a>La Cisa pass</a>) below the upper <a>Magra</a> River valley. The range follows the <a>Gulf of Genoa</a> separating it from the upper <a>Po Valley</a>. The northwestern border follows the line of the Bormida River to <a>Acqui Terme</a>. There the river continues northeast to <a>Alessandria</a> in the <a>Po Valley</a>, but the mountains bend away to the southeast.

</p>
<p>
The upper Bormida can be reached by a number of roads proceeding inland at a right angle to the coast southwest of <a>Savona</a>, the chief one being the Autostrada Torino-Savona. They ascend to the Bocchetta di <a>Altare</a>, sometimes called <a>Colle di Cadibona</a>, 436 m (1,430 ft), the border between the <a>Ligurian Alps</a> along the coast to the west and the Ligurian Apennines. A bronze plaque fixed to a stone marks the top of the pass. In the vicinity are fragments of the old road and three ruins of former fortifications.

</p>
<p>
At <a>Carcare</a>, the main roads connect with the upper Bormida valley (Bormida di Mallare) before turning west. The <a>Scrivia</a>, the <a>Trebbia</a> and the <a>Taro</a>, tributaries of the <a>Po River</a>, drain the northeast slopes. The range contains dozens of peaks. Toward the southern end the <a>Aveto Natural Regional Park</a> includes <a>Monte Penna</a>. Nearby is the highest point of Ligurian Apennines, <a>Monte Maggiorasca</a> at 1,800 m (5,900 ft).<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The main and only feasible overland route connecting the coastal plain of Liguria to the north Italian plain runs through Bocchetta di Altare. It has always been of strategic importance. Defenders of north Italy have had to control it since ancient times, as the various fortifications placed there testify. <a>Trenitalia</a>, the state railway system, highly developed on the coastal plain, now traverses the mountains routinely through a number of railway tunnels, such as the one at <a>Giovi Pass</a>.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/MonteCimone3.jpg/230px-MonteCimone3.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The southeastern border of the Ligurian Apennines is the Fiume <a>Magra</a>, which projects into the Tyrrhenian Sea south of <a>La Spezia</a>, and the Fiume <a>Taro</a>, which runs in the opposite direction to join the Po. The divide between the two upper river valleys is the <a>Cisa Pass</a>. Under it (in two tunnels) runs the <a>Autostrada della Cisa</a> between Spezia and <a>Parma</a>.

</p>
<p>
Starting at <a>Cisa Pass</a>, the mountain chain turns further to the southeast, to cross the peninsula along the border between the <a>Emilia-Romagna</a> and <a>Tuscany</a> regions. They are named the Tuscan–Emilian Apennines west of the <a>Futa Pass</a> and the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines east of it, or just the Tuscan Apennines.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> They extend to the upper <a>Tiber River</a>. The highest point is <a>Monte Cimone</a> at 2,165 m (7,103 ft).

</p>
<p>
A separate branch, the <a>Apuan Alps</a>, goes southwest, bordering the coast south of <a>La Spezia</a>. Whether they are to be considered part of the Apennines is a matter of opinion; certainly, they are part of the Apennine System. Topographically only the valley of the River <a>Serchio</a>, which running parallel to the coast turns and exits into the Tyrrhenian Sea north of <a>Pisa</a>, separates the Apuan Alps from the Apennines; geologically the rock is of a slightly different composition, <a>marble</a>. The Roman marble industry was centered at <a>Luna</a>, and is now active in <a>Carrara</a>.

</p>
<p>
As the Tuscan Apennines divide the peninsula between the <a>Po Valley</a> and the plains and hills of <a>Tuscany</a> and <a>Lazio</a>, transportation over them has been used to achieve political and economic unity. Historically the Romans used the <a>Via Flaminia</a> between <a>Rome</a> and <a>Rimini</a>. The montane distance between <a>Florence</a> in <a>Tuscany</a> and <a>Bologna</a> in <a>Emilia-Romagna</a> is shorter, but exploitation of it required the conquest of more rugged terrain, which was not feasible for the ancients. Railway lines were constructed over the mountains in the early 19th century but they were of low capacity and unimprovable.

</p>
<p>
Since 1856, a series of tunnels have been constructed to conduct "the Bologna-Florence rail line", which is neither a single line nor a single tunnel. The Porrettana Line went into service in 1864, the Direttissima in 1934 and the High Speed in 1996.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> A few dozen tunnels support the three of them, the longest on the High-Speed Line being the Voglia Tunnel at 16.757 km (10.412 mi).<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> The longest is on the Direttissima, the Great Apennine Tunnel, which at 18.5 kilometres (11.5 miles) is the longest entirely within Italy, although the <a>Simplon Tunnel</a>, which connects Italy and Switzerland, is longer.<sup><a href="#ref_note 2">[note 2]</a></sup> Automobile traffic is carried by the Autostrada del Sole, Route A1, which goes through numerous shorter tunnels, bypassing an old road, originally Roman, through Futa Pass. In December 2015, a new Route A1 called <a>Variante di Valico</a> was opened after many years of construction consisting of major tunnels (the longest being the new 8.6-kilometre (5.3-mile) 'Tunel Base') and new overpasses, shortening the traveling time between Florence and Bologna by road. The <a>Foreste Casentinesi, Monte Falterona, Campigna National Park</a> is in the southern part of the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines. The southern limit of the Tuscan–Romagnol Apennines is the <a>Bocca Serriola Pass</a> in northern <a>Umbria</a>, which links <a>Fano</a> and <a>Città di Castello</a>.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/Colonna_tevere.jpg/230px-Colonna_tevere.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The <a>Tiber River</a> at <a>Rome</a> flows from <a>Monte Fumaiolo</a> in the Tuscan-Romagnol Apennine from northeast to southwest, projecting into the Tyrrhenian Sea at right angles to the shore. The upper Tiber, however, flows from northwest to southeast, gradually turning through one right angle clockwise. The northern Tiber valley is deep and separates the Apennines on the left bank from a lesser range, the Tuscan <a>Anti-Apennines</a> (Sub-Apennines) on its right.

</p>
<h3 id="Central_Apennines">Central Apennines</h3>
<p>
The Apennine System forms an irregular arc with centers of curvature located in the Tyrrhenian Sea. The northern and southern segments comprise parallel chains that can be viewed as single overall mountain ridges, such as the Ligurian Mountains. The center, being thicker and more complex, is geologically divided into an inner and an outer arc with regard to the centers of curvature. The geologic definition, however, is not the same as the geographic.

</p>
<p>
Based on rock type and orogenic incidents, the northern segment of the arc is divided into the Outer Northern Apennines (ONA) and the Inner Northern Apennines (INA).<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> The Central Apennines are divided into the Umbrian–Marchean (<i>Appennino umbro-marchigiano</i>) or Roman Apennines in the north and the Abruzzi Apennines (<i>Appennino abruzzese</i>) in the south. It extends from Bocca Serriola pass in the north to Forlì pass in the south.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The west border of the Umbria-Marche Apennines (or <i>Appennino umbro-marchigiano</i>)) runs through <a>Cagli</a>. They extend south to the <a>Tronto</a> River, the south border of the ONA.
The highest peak, <a>Monte Vettore</a>, at 2,478 m (8,130 ft), is part of the <a>Monti Sibillini</a>, incorporated into <a>Parco Nazionale dei Monti Sibillini</a>. Further north is the <a>parco naturale regionale della Gola della Rossa e di Frasassi</a><span> [<a>it</a>]</span>, in which are the Gola della Rossa ("Red Gorge") and <a>Frasassi Caves</a>. Still further north is Parco Sasso Simone e Simoncello.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> The Italian Park Service calls it the "green heart" of Italy. The region is heavily forested, such as the Riserva Naturale Statale Gola del Furlo, where <a>Furlo Pass</a> on the <a>Via Flaminia</a> is located. Both the <a>Etruscans</a> and the Romans constructed tunnels here.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Gran_Sasso_in_clouds.JPG/230px-Gran_Sasso_in_clouds.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The Abruzzi Apennines, located in <a>Abruzzo</a>, <a>Molise</a> and southeastern <a>Lazio</a>, contain the highest peaks and most rugged terrain of the Apennines. They are known in history as the territory of the Italic peoples first defeated by the city of <a>Rome</a>. Coincidentally they exist in three parallel folds or chains surviving from the <a>orogeny</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> These extend in a northwest–southeast direction from the River <a>Tronto</a> to the River <a>Sangro</a>, which drain into the <a>Adriatic</a>. The coastal hills of the east extend between <a>San Benedetto del Tronto</a> in the north and <a>Torino di Sangro</a> in the south.

</p>
<p>
The eastern chain consists mainly of the southern part of the <a>Monti Sibillini</a>, the <a>Monti della Laga</a>, the <a>Gran Sasso d'Italia</a> Massif and the <a>Majella</a> Massif. Among them are two national parks: <a>Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park</a> and <a>Majella National Park</a>; and the Regional Park of the Monti Simbruini. Gran Sasso contains <a>Corno Grande</a>, the highest peak of the Apennines (2912 m).

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Prateria_sul_Passo_San_Leonardo_-_panoramio.jpg/230px-Prateria_sul_Passo_San_Leonardo_-_panoramio.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Other features between the western and central ranges are the plain of <a>Rieti</a>, the valley of the Salto, and the <a>Lago Fucino</a>; while between the central and eastern ranges are the valleys of <a>Aquila</a> and <a>Sulmona</a>. The chief rivers on the west are the <a>Nera</a>, with its <a>tributaries</a> the Velino and Salto, and the <a>Aniene</a>, both of which fall into the Tiber. On the east there is at first a succession of small rivers which flow into the <a>Adriatic</a>, from which the highest points of the chain are some 20 km distant, such as the <a>Tronto</a>, Tordino, Vomano and others. The Pescara, which receives the <a>Aterno</a> from the north-west and the Gizio from the south-east, is more important; and so is the <a>Sangro</a>.

</p>
<p>
The central Apennines are crossed by the railway from <a>Rome</a> to <a>Pescara</a> via <a>Avezzano</a> and Sulmona: the railway from <a>Orte</a> to <a>Terni</a> (and thence to <a>Foligno</a>) follows the Nera valley; while from Terni a line ascends to the plain of Rieti, and thence crosses the central chain to Aquila, whence it follows the valley of the Aterno to Sulmona. In ancient times the <a>Via Salaria</a>, <a>Via Caecilia</a> and Via Valeria-Claudia all ran from Rome to the Adriatic coast. The volcanic mountains of the province of Rome are separated from the Apennines by the Tiber valley, and the <a>Monti Lepini</a>, part of the Volscian chain, by the valleys of the <a>Sacco</a> and <a>Liri</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Southern_Apennines">Southern Apennines</h3>
<p>
The southern Apennines can be divided into four major regions: (1) Samnite Apennines, (2) Campanian Apennines, (3) Lucan Apennines and (4) Calabrian Apennines (including the Sicilian Apennines). They extend from Forlì pass towards south.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/Monti_Picentini.jpg/220px-Monti_Picentini.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
In the southern Apennines, to the south of the <a>Sangro</a> valley, the three parallel chains are broken up into smaller groups; among them may be named the <a>Matese</a>, the highest point of which is the Monte Miletto 2,050 metres (6,725 ft). The chief rivers on the south-west are the <a>Liri</a> or <a>Garigliano</a> with its tributary the Sacco, the <a>Volturno</a>, Sebeto, Sarno, on the north the Trigno, Biferno and <a>Fortore</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Daunian mountains</a>, in <a>Apulia</a>, are connected with the Apennine range, and so are <a>Cilento</a> hills on the west. On the converse the promontory of <a>Mount Gargano</a>, on the east, is completely isolated, and so are the <a>Campanian</a><a>volcanic arc</a>  near <a>Naples</a>. The district is traversed from north-west to south-east by the railway from <a>Sulmona</a> to <a>Benevento</a> and on to <a>Avellino</a>, and from south-west to northeast by the railways from Caianello via Isernia to <a>Campobasso</a> and Termoli, from Caserta to Benevento and Foggia, and from <a>Nocera Inferiore</a> and Avellino to Rocchetta Sant'Antonio, the junction for Foggia, Spinazzola (for Barletta, Bari, and <a>Taranto</a>) and Potenza. Roman roads followed the same lines as the railways: the <a>Via Appia</a> ran from <a>Capua</a> to Benevento, whence the older road went to Venosa and Taranto and so to <a>Brindisi</a>, while the <a>Via Traiana</a> ran nearly to <a>Troia</a> (near Foggia) and thence to Bari.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The valley of the <a>Ofanto</a>, which runs into the Adriatic close to <a>Barletta</a>, marks the northern termination of the first range of the Lucanian Apennines (now <a>Basilicata</a>), which runs from east to west, while south of the valleys of the Sele (on the west) and <a>Basento</a> (on the east)—which form the line followed by the railway from Battipaglia via <a>Potenza</a> to <a>Metaponto</a>—the second range begins to run due north and south as far as the plain of <a>Sibari</a>. The highest point is the Monte <a>Pollino</a> 2,233 metres (7,325 ft). The chief rivers are the Sele—joined by the Negro and Calore—on the west, and the <a>Bradano</a>, <a>Basento</a>, Agri, Sinni on the east, which flow into the gulf of Taranto; to the south of the last-named river there are only unimportant streams flowing into the sea east and west, inasmuch as here the width of the peninsula diminishes to some 64 kilometres (40 mi).<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/41/Pizzo_Carbonara.jpg/230px-Pizzo_Carbonara.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The railway running south from Sicignano to Lagonegro, ascending the valley of the Negro, is planned to extend to Cosenza, along the line followed by the ancient Via Popilia, which beyond Cosenza reached the west coast at Terina and thence followed it to Reggio. The Via Herculia, a branch of the Via Traiana, ran from Aequum Tuticum to the ancient Nerulum. At the narrowest point the plain of Sibari, through which the rivers Coscile and Crati flow to the sea, occurs on the east coast, extending halfway across the peninsula. Here the limestone Apennines proper cease and the granite mountains of <a>Calabria</a> begin.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The first group extends as far as the <a>isthmus</a> formed by the gulfs of South Eufemia and Squillace; it is known as the Sila, and the highest point reached is 1,930 metres (6,330 ft) (the <a>Botte Donato</a>). The forests which covered it in ancient times supplied the Greeks and Sicilians with timber for shipbuilding. The railway from South Eufemia to <a>Catanzaro</a> and Catanzaro Marina crosses the isthmus, and an ancient road may have run from Squillace to Monteleone. The second group extends to the south end of the <a>Italian Peninsula</a>, culminating in the <a>Aspromonte</a> (1,960 metres (6,420 ft)) to the east of <a>Reggio di Calabria</a>. In both groups the rivers are quite unimportant.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Finally, the Calabrian southern Apennine Mountains extend along the northern coast of Sicily (the Sicilian Apennines, Italian <i>Appennino siculo</i>)—<a>Pizzo Carbonara</a> (6,493 feet (1,979 m)) being the highest peak.

The number of <a>vascular plant</a> species in the Apennines has been estimated at 5,599.  Of these, 728 (23.6%) are in the treeline <a>ecotone</a>. <a>Hemicryptophytes</a> predominate in the entire Apennine chain.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>
The Apennines were created in the Apennine <a>orogeny</a> beginning in the early <a>Neogene</a> (about 20 <a>mya</a>, the middle <a>Miocene</a>) and continuing today.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Geographically they are partially (or appear to be) continuous with the <a>Alpine system</a>. Prior to the explosion of data on the topic from about the year 2000, many authors took the approach that the Apennines had the same origin as the Alps. Even today, some authors use the term Alpine-Apennine system. They are not, however, the same system and did not have the same origin. The Alps were millions of years old before the Apennines rose from the sea.

</p>
<p>
Both the Alps and the Apennines contain primarily sedimentary rock resulting from sedimentation of the ancient <a>Tethys Sea</a> in the <a>Mesozoic</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The northward movement of the African Plate and its collision with the European Plate then caused the <a>Alpine Orogeny</a>, beginning in the late Mesozoic. The band of mountains created extends from Spain to Turkey in a roughly east–west direction and includes the Alps. The Apennines are much younger, extend from northwest to southeast, and are not a displacement of the Alpine chain.

</p>
<p>
The key evidence of the difference is the geologic behavior of the <a>Po Valley</a> in northern Italy. Compressional forces have been acting from north to south in the Alps and from south to north in the Apennines, but instead of being squeezed into mountains the valley has been subsiding at 1 to 4 mm (0.16 in) per year since about 25 <a>mya</a>, before the Apennines <span>existed.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup></span> It is now known to be not an erosional feature but is a filled portion of the Adriatic Trench, called the Adriatic <a>foredeep</a> after its function as a subduction zone was discovered. The Alps and the Apennines were always separated by this trench and were never part of the same system.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Apennine_orogeny">Apennine orogeny</h3>
<p>
The Apennine orogeny is a type of mountain-building in which two simpler types are combined in an apparently paradoxical configuration. Sometimes this is referred to as "syn-orogenic extension", but the term implies that the two processes occur simultaneously during time.
Some scientists imagine that this is relatively rare but not unique in mountain building, whereas others imagine that this is fairly common in all mountain belts.

</p>
<p>
The RETREAT Project<sup><a href="#ref_note 3">[note 3]</a></sup> have this specific feature as one of their focus points<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
In essence the east side of Italy features a <a>fold and thrust belt</a> raised by compressional forces acting under the <a>Adriatic</a> Sea. This side has been called the "Apennine-Adriatic Compressional Zone" or the "Apennines Convergence Zone." On the west side of Italy <a>fault-block mountains</a> prevail, created by a spreading or extension of the crust under the <a>Tyrrhenian Sea</a>. This side is called the "Tyrrhenian Extensional Zone." The mountains of Italy are of paradoxical provenience, having to derive from both compression and extension:

</p>
<p>
Both the folded and the fault-block systems include parallel mountain chains. In the folded system <a>anticlines</a> erode into the highest and longest massifs of the Apennines.

</p>
<p>
According to the older theories (originating from the 1930s to 1970s) of Dutch geologists, including Van Bemmelen, compression and extension can and should occur simultaneously at different depths in a mountain belt. In these theories, these different levels are called <i>Stockwerke</i>. More recent work in geotectonics and geodynamics of the same school of geoscientists (Utrecht and Amsterdam University) by Vlaar, Wortel, and Cloetingh, and their disciples, extended these concepts even further into a temporal realm. They demonstrated that internal and external forces acting upon the mountain belt (e.g., <a>slab pull</a> and intra-plate stress field modulations due to large scale reorganisations of the <a>tectonic plates</a>) result in both longer episodes and shorter phases of general extension and compression acting both upon and inside mountain belts and tectonic arches (See e.g. for extensive reviews, bibliography and discussions on the literature:
Van Dijk (1992),<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
Van Dijk and Okkes (1991),<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
Van Dijk & Scheepers (1995),<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
and Van Dijk et al. (2000a)<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>).

</p>
<p>
The gradual subsidence of the <a>Po Valley</a> (including that of <a>Venice</a>) and the folding of the mountains of eastern Italy have been investigated using <a>seismic wave</a> analysis of the "Apennine <a>Subduction</a> System."<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> Along the Adriatic side of Italy the floor of the <a>Adriatic Sea</a>, referred to as the "Adriatic lithosphere" or the "Adriatic plate," terms whose precise meaning is the subject of ongoing research, is dipping under the slab on which the Apennines have been folded by compressional forces.

</p>
<p>
Subduction occurs along a <a>fault</a>, along which a <a>hanging wall</a>, or overriding slab is thrust over an overridden slab, also called the subducting slab. The fault that acts as the subduction interface is at the bottom of the Apennine wedge, characterized by a deep groove in the surface, typically filled with sediment, as sedimentation here occurs at a much faster rate than subduction.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In north Italy the dip of this interface is 30° to 40° at a depth of 80–90 km.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>strike</a> of the Apennine subduction zone forms a long, irregular arc with centers of curvature in the Tyrrhenian Sea following the hanging wall over which the mountains have been raised; i.e., the eastern wall of the mountains. It runs from near the base of the Ligurian Apennines in the Po Valley along the margin of the mountains to the Adriatic, along the coastal deeps of the Adriatic shore, strikes inland at <a>Monte Gargano</a> cutting off <a>Apulia</a>, out to sea again through the <a>Gulf of Taranto</a>, widely around the rest of Italy and <a>Sicily</a> and across inland north Africa.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The <a>upper mantle</a> above 250 km (160 mi) deep is broken into the "Northern Apennines Arc" and the "Calabrian Arc", with compressional forces acting in different directions radially toward the arcs' centers of curvature. The overall <a>plate tectonics</a> of these events has been modeled in different ways but decisive data is still missing. The tectonics, however, are not the same as those which created the Alps.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The west side of Italy is given to a <a>fault-block</a> system, where the crust – extended by the lengthening mantle below – thinned, broke along roughly parallel <a>fault</a> lines, and the blocks alternatively sank into <a>grabens</a> or were raised by <a>isostasy</a> into <a>horsts</a>. This system prevails from <a>Corsica</a> eastward to the valley of the <a>Tiber River</a>, the last rift valley in that direction. It runs approximately across the direction of extension. In the fault-block system, the ridges are lower and are more steep-sided, since the walls are formed by faults. Geographically they are not considered part of the Apennines proper but are termed <b>Sub-Apennines</b> (<i>Subappennini</i>) or <b>Anti-Apennines</b> (<i>Antiappennini</i>) or <b>Pre-Apennines</b> (<i>Preappennini</i>).  These mountains are found mainly in <a>Tuscany</a>, <a>Lazio</a> and <a>Campania</a>.

</p>
<h3 id="Stability_of%20terrain">Stability of terrain</h3>
<p>
The terrain of the Apennines (as well as that of the Alps) is to a large degree unstable due to various types of <a>landslides</a>, including falls and slides of rocks and debris, flows of earth and mud, and sink holes. The Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (<i>Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale</i>), a government agency founded in 2008 by combining three older agencies, published in that year a special report, <i>Landslides in Italy</i>, summarizing the results of the IFFI Project (<i>Il Progetto IFFI</i>), the Italian Landslide Inventory (<i>Inventario dei Fenomeni Franosi in Italia</i>), an extensive survey of historical landslides in Italy undertaken by the government starting in 1997. On December 31, 2007, it had studied and mapped 482,272 landslides over 20,500 km<sup>2</sup> (7,900 sq mi). Its major statistics are the Landslide Index (LI here), the ratio of the landslide area to the total area of a region, the Landslide Index in Mountainous-Hilly Areas (here LIMH) and the Density of Landslides, which is the number per 100 km<sup>2</sup> (39 sq mi).

</p>
<p>
Italy as a whole has a LI of 6.8, a LIMH of 9.1 and a density of 160. <a>Lombardia</a> (LI of 13.9), <a>Emilia-Romagna</a> (11.4), <a>Marches</a> (19.4), <a>Molise</a> (14.0), <a>Valle d'Aosta</a> (16.0) and <a>Piemonte</a> (9.1) are significantly higher.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> The most unstable terrain in the Apennines when the landslide sites are plotted on the map are in order from most unstable the eastern flanks of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines, the Central Apennines and the eastern flank of the southern Apennines. Instability there is comparable to the Alps bordering the <a>Po Valley</a>. The most stable terrain is on the western side: <a>Liguria</a>, <a>Tuscany</a>, <a>Umbria</a> and <a>Lazio</a>. The Apennines are slumping away to the northeast into the Po Valley and the Adriatic <a>foredeep</a>; that is, the zone where the Adriatic floor is being subducted under Italy. Slides with large translational or rotational surface movements are most common; e.g., a whole slope slumps into its valley, placing the population there at risk.

</p>
<h3 id="Glacial_ice">Glacial ice</h3>
<p>
Glaciers no longer exist in the Apennines outside the <a>Gran Sasso d'Italia</a> massif. However, post-Pliocene <a>moraines</a> have been observed in Basilicata.

</p>
<h2 id="Major_peaks">Major peaks</h2>
<p>
The Apennines include about 21 peaks over 1,900 m (6,200 ft), the approximate <a>tree line</a> (counting only the top peak in each massif). Most of these peaks are located in the Central Apennines.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>

<i>Apenninus</i> (Greek <span>Ἀπέννινος</span> or <span>Ἀπέννινα</span>) has the form of an adjective, which would be segmented <i>Apenn-inus</i>, often used with nouns such as <i>mons</i> ("mountain") or Greek <span>ὄρος</span> (<i>óros</i>), but <i>Apenninus</i> is just as often used alone as a noun. The ancient Greeks and Romans typically but not always used "mountain" in the singular to mean one or a range; thus, "the Apennine mountain" refers to the entire chain and is translated "the Apennine mountains". The ending can vary also by gender depending on the noun modified. The Italian singular refers to one of the constituent chains rather than to a single mountain, and the Italian plural refers to multiple chains rather than to multiple mountains.
