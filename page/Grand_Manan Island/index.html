  <h1 id="Grand_Manan%20Island">Grand Manan Island</h1>
<p>
<b>Grand Manan</b> is a Canadian island in the <a>Bay of Fundy</a>. Grand Manan is also the name of an incorporated village, which includes the main island and all of its adjacent islands, except <a>White Head Island</a>. It is governed as a village and is part of the province of <a>New Brunswick</a>.

</p>
<p>
The point on the mainland closest to the island is near the town of <a>Lubec, Maine</a>, the easternmost point of the <a>continental United States</a>, 15 km (9.3 mi) across the Grand Manan Channel. Grand Manan is 32 kilometres south of <a>Blacks Harbour, New Brunswick</a>.

<p>
"Manan" is a corruption of <i>mun-an-ook</i> or <i>man-an-ook</i>, meaning "island place" or "the island", from the <a>Maliseet</a>-<a>Passamaquoddy</a>-<a>Penobscot</a><a>First Nations</a>  who, according to oral history, used Grand Manan and its surrounding islands as a safe place for the elderly Passamaquoddy during winter months and as a sacred burial place (<i>ook</i> means "people of"). In 1606 <a>Samuel de Champlain</a> sheltered on nearby White Head Island and produced a map calling the island "Manthane", which he later changed to "Menane" or "Menasne".

<p>
Portuguese explorer <a>João Álvares Fagundes</a> charted the area around 1520, but the island does not appear clearly on a map until 1558, produced by Portuguese cartographer <a>Diogo Homem</a>. French merchant-explorer <a>Étienne Bellenger</a> visited the area in January 1583.

</p>
<p>
In 1693, the island was granted to Paul D'Ailleboust, Sieur de Périgny as part of Champlain's "<a>New France</a>". D'Ailleboust did not take possession of it, and it reverted to the French Crown, in whose possession it remained until 1713, when it was traded to the British in the <a>Treaty of Utrecht</a>.

</p>
<p>
The first permanent settlement was established in 1784, when <a>Moses Gerrish</a> gathered a group of settlers on an area of Grand Manan he called Ross Island, in honour of settler Thomas Ross. During the American Revolution, just off the island there were many naval battles between American privateers and British shipping.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Because of the <a>Treaty of Paris (1783)</a>, the U.S. considered Grand Manan to be its possession due to the island's proximity to Maine. Britain obtained title in <a>Jay's Treaty</a> of 1794, while surrendering its sovereignty claims over Eastport on Moose, Frederick and Dudley islands in nearby <a>Cobscook Bay</a>.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Sealcove.jpg/200px-Sealcove.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
From 1812 to 1814, the Bay of Fundy was infested with <a>privateers</a> who raided and plundered villages. The ownership of islands in <a>Passamaquoddy Bay</a> was not settled until 1817, when the United States gave up its claim to Grand Manan and the surrounding islands.

</p>
<p>
By 1832 schools were established by the <a>Anglican Church</a>. While neighbouring islands along the American coast to Boston relied on whaling, Grand Manan had fishing and shipbuilding.

</p>
<p>
In 1831 the <a>Gannet Rock Lighthouse</a> was built on a rocky islet south of Grand Manan, to protect shipping en route to <a>Saint John, New Brunswick</a>. It is Grand Manan's oldest lighthouse.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
This period was also marked by a number of shipwrecks off the island's rocky, cliff-lined coast. In 1857, the <i><a>Lord Ashburton</a></i>, was driven into the cliffs at the northern end of the island by hurricane-force winds to great loss of life.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> Another wreck was the Nova Scotian <a>barque</a><a><i>Walton</i></a> , which was bound for <a>Saint John, New Brunswick</a>, from <a>Wales</a> when it wrecked on the White Ledge off Grand Manan on September 14, 1878.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By 1851, the island population numbered almost 1,200 permanent inhabitants, most working in fishing.

</p>
<p>
By 1884, Grand Manan became the largest supplier of smoked <a>herring</a> in the world. By 1920, it produced one million boxes—or twenty thousand tons—of smoked herring, all caught in its local waters.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
By the late Victorian era, Grand Manan had been discovered by a new breed of explorers—the "tourists"—who began visiting the island in steady numbers, weaving themselves into the fabric of its close-knit, isolated society. Pulitzer Prize–winning author <a>Willa Cather</a> loved the island's unspoiled solitude, while painters such as <a>Alfred Thompson Bricher</a> and <a>John James Audubon</a> came to Grand Manan and its outlying islands to capture what they believed to be its "unique majesty", documenting its varied geography and indigenous fauna.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
It is the largest of the <a>Fundy Islands</a>, and the primary island in the Grand Manan archipelago, which also includes <a>White Head Island</a>, Gull Rock, and <a>North Rock</a> are part of the larger Grand Manan <a>archipelago</a>.

</p>
<p>
Grand Manan is 34 km (21 mi) long and has a maximum width of 18 km (11 mi) with an area of 137 square kilometres (53 sq mi).

</p>
<p>
The vast majority of Grand Manan residents live on the eastern side of the island. Due to limited access, 91-metre (300 ft) cliffs and high winds, the western side of the island is not residentially developed.

</p>
<h3 id="Geology">Geology</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Grand_Manan_Geology_Map.jpg/270px-Grand_Manan_Geology_Map.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The western two-thirds of the island shows thick lava flows (<a>basalt</a>) of Late Triassic age, part of a <a>flood basalt</a> that underlies most of the Bay of Fundy. The Fundy basalts are themselves a small portion of the <a>Central Atlantic Magmatic Province</a> which was formed in a volcanic event preceding the breakup of the supercontinent <a>Pangaea</a> in the Early Jurassic.

</p>
<p>
Many minerals have filled the cracks and bubbles left by gases boiling out of the cooling lavas. They include <a>zeolite</a> minerals such as chabazite, mesolite, stilbite, and heulandite, plus attractive quartz-related amethyst, agate, jasper, and many others. Good collecting areas include Seven Days Work, Indian Beach, and Bradford Cove. A few meters of siltstone are exposed under the basalt along the western shoreline, which by analogy with the <a>Blomidon Formation</a> in Nova Scotia must include the Triassic-Jurassic boundary.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Harbours along the eastern shoreline were created by the erosion of complex fault and fold structures in ancient metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rock formations. A major north-south fault is exposed at Red Point, and it divides these older eastern rocks from the western basalts. The metamorphic formations are organized into groups called Castalia, Ingalls Head, and Grand Manan, and there are also metamorphosed plutonic masses such as Stanley Brook Granite, Rockweed Pond Gabbro, and Kent Island Granite.

</p>
<p>
These rocks have recently been dated between 539 and 618 million years old [ref. Black and others, 2007] and are now considered to correlate with the New River and Mascarene terranes of southern New Brunswick, Canada. Although originally they were igneous and sedimentary rocks such as basalt, sandstone, and shale, the eastern formations have been metamorphosed into greenstone, phyllite, argillite, schist, quartzite, and other foliated types. In addition, many folds and faults have bent and broken the formations in rather tortured-looking outcrops. One such fault can be seen at the north end of Pettes Cove, where it separates <a>metabasalt</a> of Swallowtail Head from schist of North Head.

<p>
Grand Manan has a <a>humid continental climate</a> (<i>Dfb</i>). The climate in spring, summer and fall is very comfortable but winter has an inconsistent weather pattern with snow, rain, freezing rain and mild weather. Since 2000, the average annual precipitation has been 859.8 mm with August being the driest month (35 mm) and October (112 mm) the wettest.

</p>
<p>
The highest temperature ever recorded on Grand Manan was 33.3 °C (92 °F) on 26 July 1963.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> The coldest temperature ever recorded was −30.6 °C (−23 °F) on 10 January 1890.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>

<p>
Grand Manan's <a>economy</a> is dependent upon <a>fishing</a>, <a>aquaculture</a> and <a>tourism</a>. Lobster, herring, scallops and crab are most commonly sought among fishermen. Together with ocean salmon farms, dulse, rock weed and clam digging, many residents make their living "on the water".

</p>
<p>
Tourism is growing significantly, providing the island with a highly profitable "green" industry. Whale and bird watching, camping and kayaking are popular activities for tourists. Visitors and retirees often purchase real-estate and remain on the island through the summer months or reside permanently as every necessary amenity exists for people of all ages. Approximately 54% of the island is owned by non-residents. The community is noted for its friendly people, low crime rate, high church membership, quaint villages, and unspoiled sea-scapes. New York architect Michael Zimmer established the Sardine Museum and Herring Hall of Fame.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
There are freshwater ponds, lakes and beaches that are prime locations for sunbathing, beachcombing, and picnics. Other interesting finds on Grand Manan are magnetic sand, and "The Hole-In-The Wall" located in Whale Cove in the village of North Head. <a>Anchorage Provincial Park</a> can be found on the island's southeastern coast between the communities of Grand Harbour and Seal Cove.

</p>
<h2 id="Demographics">Demographics</h2>
<p>
As of 2016, the village had a population of 2,360.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> The population density was 42.26 people per square mile (16.31/km<sup>2</sup>). There were 1,298 housing units at an average density of 22.29/sq mi (8.60/km<sup>2</sup>). The racial make-up of the island was 99.17% White;  and less than 1% Latin American and Aboriginal populations. Those who were third generation or more made up 89% of the population.

</p>
<p>
There were 1,045 households, out of which 23% had children under the age of 18 living with them. Of the 700 census families on the island, 71.42% were married couples living together. The average family size was 2.90.

</p>
<p>
On the island the population was spread out, with 25% age 19 or under; 5% from 20 to 24, 27% from 25 to 44, 25.4% from 45 to 64, and 17.1% at 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40.3 years.

</p>
<p>
The median income for a family was $48,190. Males had a median income of $32,183 versus $23,106 for females.  A full 63% of the population 15 years and older had at least a high school certificate or equivalent, with 22% having at least some college, <a>CEGEP</a>, or university training.

1981–2010 normals are derived from data collected at Seal Cove, however extreme high and low temperatures have been recorded on various parts of the island since 1883. Based on station coordinates, climate data was recorded in the area of Castalia from July 1883 to April 1912 and again from July 1962 to March 1965, at Seal Cove from November 1987 to February 2004 and at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Manan_Airport">Grand Manan Airport</a> from November 2000 to present.
