<div>This article is about the mountain in the U.S. state of Georgia. For the city it is located in of the same name, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain,_Georgia">Stone Mountain, Georgia</a>. For other uses, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Mountain_(disambiguation)">Stone Mountain (disambiguation)</a>.</div>
<p>
<b>Stone Mountain</b> is a <a>quartz monzonite</a> dome <a>monadnock</a> and the site of <b>Stone Mountain Park</b>, 16 miles (26 km) east of <a>Atlanta, Georgia</a>. Outside the park is the small city of <a>Stone Mountain, Georgia</a>. The park is the most visited tourist site in the state of Georgia.

</p>
<p>
The park is owned by the state of <a>Georgia</a> and managed by <a>Herschend Family Entertainment</a>. At its summit, the <a>elevation</a> is 1,686 feet (514 m) <a>above sea level</a> and 825 feet (251 m) above the surrounding area. Stone Mountain is well known for not only its <a>geology</a>, but also the enormous <a>rock relief</a> on its north face, the largest <a>bas-relief</a> artwork in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>  The carving, completed in 1972, depicts three <a>Confederate</a> leaders, <a>Jefferson Davis</a>, <a>Robert E. Lee</a>, and <a>Stonewall Jackson</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Stone Mountain, once owned by the <a>Venable Brothers</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> was seen from the outset  "as a memorial to the Confederacy."<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> Stone Mountain Park officially opened on April 14, 1965 – 100 years to the day after <a>Lincoln's assassination</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> although the park had already been in use for a few years.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>
The mountain, which ranges in composition from <a>quartz monzonite</a> to granite and <a>granodiorite</a>, is more than 5 miles (8 km) in circumference at its base. The summit of the mountain can be reached by a walk-up trail on the west side of the mountain or by the Skyride <a>aerial tram</a>.

<p>
Stone Mountain is a <a>pluton</a>, a type of <a>igneous</a><a>intrusion</a> . Primarily composed of <a>quartz monzonite</a>, the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the <a>Blue Ridge Mountains</a> around 300–350 million years ago (during the <a>Carboniferous</a> period), part of the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> It formed as a result of the upwelling of <a>magma</a> from within the Earth's <a>crust</a>. This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.

</p>
<p>
The Stone Mountain pluton continues underground 9 miles (14 km) at its longest point into <a>Gwinnett County</a>. Numerous reference books and Georgia literature have dubbed Stone Mountain as "the largest exposed piece of granite in the world".<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> This misconception is most likely a result of misrepresentation by granite companies and early park administration. Stone Mountain, though often called a pink granite dome, actually ranges in composition from <a>quartz monzonite</a><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> to granite and <a>granodiorite</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The minerals within the rock include <a>quartz</a>, <a>plagioclase feldspar</a>, <a>microcline</a>, and <a>muscovite</a>, with smaller amounts of <a>biotite</a> and <a>tourmaline</a>. The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> crystals, but much larger, <a>euhedral</a><a>pegmatitic</a>  tourmaline crystals can also be found in the mountain's numerous, cross-cutting <a>felsic</a><a>dikes</a> .
Embedded in the granite are <a>xenoliths</a> or pieces of foreign rocks entrained in the magma.

</p>
<p>
The granite intruded into the metamorphic rocks of the <a>Piedmont region</a> during the last stages of the <a>Alleghenian Orogeny</a>, which was the time when <a>North America</a> and <a>North Africa</a> collided. Over time, <a>erosion</a> eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock. This intrusion of granite also gave rise to <a>Panola Mountain</a> and Arabia Mountain, both in <a>DeKalb County</a>, smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.

<p>
The top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock <a>pools</a>, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of <a>downtown Atlanta</a>, often <a>Kennesaw Mountain</a>, and on very clear days even the <a>Appalachian Mountains</a>. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet.

</p>
<p>
The clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual <a>clam shrimp</a> and <a>fairy shrimp</a>. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season. Through the process of <a>cryptobiosis</a>, the tiny shrimp eggs (or <a>cysts</a>) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions. These <a>vernal pools</a> are also home to several federally listed rare and endangered plant species, such as black-spored quillwort (<i><a>Isoetes melanospora</a></i>) and pool sprite (also called snorkelwort, <i><a>Gratiola amphiantha</a></i>).<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The mountain's lower slopes are wooded. The rare <a>Georgia oak</a> was first discovered at the summit, and several specimens can easily be found along the walk-up trail and in the woods around the base of the mountain. In the <a>fall</a>, the Confederate yellow daisy (<i><a>Helianthus porteri</a></i>) flowers appear on the mountain, growing in rock crevices and in the large wooded areas. More than 120 wildflowers, most of them native to the Southern Appalachians and including several rare or federally protected species, have been identified on the mountain.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>

<p>
The largest <a>bas-relief</a> sculpture in the world, the Confederate Memorial Carving depicts three Confederate leaders of the Civil War: President <a>Jefferson Davis</a> and Generals <a>Robert E. Lee</a> and <a>Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson</a> (on their favorite horses, Blackjack, <a>Traveller</a>, and Little Sorrel, respectively). The sculpture was cut 42 feet (13 m) deep into the mountain,<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> measures 90 feet (27 m) in height and 190 feet (58 m) in width,<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> and lies 400 feet (120 m) above the ground.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The project was greatly advanced by C. Helen Plane,<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> a charter member of the <a>United Daughters of the Confederacy</a> (UDC) and first president and Honorary Life President of the Georgia State Division.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 57 </span></sup> After obtaining the approval of the Georgia UDC, she set up the UDC Stone Mountain Memorial Association. She chose the <a>sculptor</a><a>Gutzon Borglum</a>  for the project and invited him to visit the mountain (although, despite his <a>Ku Klux Klan</a> involvement,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 79 </span></sup> she "would not shake his hand—he was, after all, a Yankee").<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 58–59 </span></sup> She met him at the Atlanta train station, took him to her family's summer home, Mont Rest, at the foot of the mountain, and introduced him to <a>Sam Venable</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 59 </span></sup> another active Klan member and owner of the mountain. Borglum also enlisted <a>Luigi Del Bianco</a>, whom he would also involve in Mount Rushmore.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Borglum's original plan was: five groups of figures, sixty-five mounted officers representing the states (to be chosen by the states), General <a>Nathan Bedford Forrest</a> and his cavalry—some 700 to 1,000 figures, each from 35 feet (11 m) to 50 feet (15 m) high. In addition, Borglum planned a room cut 60 feet (18 m) into the mountain, 320 feet (98 m) wide, and 40 feet (12 m) high, faced by 13 columns.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 59–60 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
Venable deeded the north face of the mountain to the UDC in 1916, on condition that it complete a sizable Civil War monument in 12 years. Finances as well as technical problems slowed progress. The <a>US Mint</a> issued a 1925 Commemorative silver US half dollar, bearing the words "Stone Mountain", as a fundraiser for the monument.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> This issue, which required the approval of both the 1926 Congress and President <a>Calvin Coolidge</a>, was the largest issue of commemorative coins by the U.S. government up to that time.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 81 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
Financial conflicts between Borglum and the Association led to his firing in 1925.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 85 </span></sup> He destroyed his models, claiming that they were his property, but the Association disagreed and had a warrant issued for his arrest. He was warned of the arrest and narrowly escaped to North Carolina, whose governor, <a>Angus McLean</a>, refused to extradite him,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 89 </span></sup> though he could not return to Georgia. The affair was highly publicized and there was much discussion and discord, including discord between Sam Venable, the Association, and its president Hollins Randolph.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 103, 116–119 </span></sup> The face of Lee that Borglum had partially completed was blasted off the mountain in 1928.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 111 </span></sup>
</p>
<p>
Borglum's next major project was <a>Mount Rushmore</a>.

</p>
<p>
After a number of sculptors turned them down,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup><sup><span>: 97 </span></sup><a>Augustus Lukeman</a>  took up the work in 1925, with a different, smaller design. Fundraising was even more difficult after the public debate and name-calling, and work stopped in 1928. In 1941 segregationist Governor <a>Eugene Talmadge</a> formed the Stone Mountain Memorial Association (SMMA) to continue work on the memorial, but the project was delayed once again by the U.S. entry into World War II (1941–45).<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In response to <i><a>Brown v. Board of Education</a></i> of 1954 and the birth of the <a>Civil Rights Movement</a>, in 1958, at the urging of segregationist Governor <a>Marvin Griffin</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><span>: 21 </span></sup> the Georgia legislature approved a measure to purchase Stone Mountain at a price of $1,125,000. In 1963 <a>Walker Hancock</a> was selected to complete the carving, and work began in 1964. The carving was dedicated in a ceremony on May 9, 1970.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> The carving was completed by Roy Faulkner on March 3, 1972.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Faulkner in 1985 opened the Stone Mountain Carving Museum (now closed) on nearby Memorial Drive commemorating the carving's history.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> An extensive archival collection related to the project is now at <a>Emory University</a>, with the bulk of the materials dating from 1915 to 1930; the <a>finding aid</a> provides a history of the project, and an index of the papers contained in the collection.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Stone Mountain Park officially opened on April 14, 1965—100 years to the day after <a>Lincoln's assassination</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> Four flags of the <a>Confederacy</a> are flown at the site.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The Stone Mountain Memorial Lawn "contains...thirteen terraces—one for each Confederate state.... Each terrace flies the flag that the state flew as member of the Confederacy."<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="The_replica%20plantation">The replica plantation</h3>
<p>
In 1963, there opened beneath the sculpture a replica plantation, where slave quarters were described as “neat” and “well furnished” in promotional materials. The slaves were called “hands” or “workers,” and Black actress <a>Butterfly McQueen</a> (from <a>Gone with the Wind</a>) was hired to guide and inform visitors.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> The park states that the plantation was inspired by <i>Gone with the Wind</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> The plantation has been renamed Historic Square.

<p>
According to sociologist <a>James W. Loewen</a>, Stone Mountain was "<i>the</i> sacred site to members of the <a>second</a> and <a>third national klans</a>."<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup><sup><span>: 262 </span></sup> Loewen alleges that the rebirth of the <a>Ku Klux Klan</a>—the second Klan—was inspired by <a>D. W. Griffith</a>'s 1915 Klan-glorifying film, <i><a>The Birth of a Nation</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> It was followed in August by the highly publicized <a>lynching</a> of <a>Leo Frank</a>, who had been wrongly convicted of murder, in nearby <a>Marietta, Georgia</a>. Loewen further alleges that on November 25 of the same year, <a>Thanksgiving Day</a>, a small group, including fifteen robed and hooded "charter members" of the new organization, met at the summit of Stone Mountain to create a new iteration of the Klan. Led by <a>William J. Simmons</a>, it included two elderly members of the original Klan. As part of their ceremony, they set up on the summit an <a>altar</a> covered with a flag, opened a <a>Bible</a>, and burned a 16-foot cross.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup><sup><span>: 20 </span></sup><sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>James R. Venable</a>, grandson of Ku Klux Klan founder <a>Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>, attended the 1915 revival of the KKK on top of Stone Mountain and later became an <a>Imperial Wizard</a> of the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, which was one of the later KKK factions.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> He owned land at the base of the mountain that he had inherited from his ancestors, and in October of 1923 he granted the Klan an <a>easement</a> with perpetual right to hold celebrations as they desired.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> However, the property was condemned in 1960 at the behest of the  Stone Mountain Memorial Association.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Klan also held cross-burnings at the summit of the mountain on different occasions from 1915 onward.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> This practice came to an end in 1962, when the Klan attempted to hold a mountaintop cross-burning in response to the <a>NAACP</a> holding its national convention in <a>Atlanta</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> The Stone Mountain Memorial Association did not want either group using state property for demonstrations, and convinced Governor <a>Ernest Vandiver</a> to order state troopers to stop the event.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Seventy troopers attempted to stop several hundred Klansmen gathered at the base of the mountain from climbing to the summit, but the Klansmen were armed with <a>billy clubs</a>, flashlights, and stones, and greatly outnumbered the officers.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> The police negotiated a truce with the local Klan <a>Grand Dragon</a>, under which the Klansmen would refrain from further violence, but 20 of their number would be allowed climb the mountain for a “religious ceremony,” and the crossburning was substituted with the lighting of a flare.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In August of 2017, the Klan was denied a permit for a mountaintop cross-burning.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Fundraising for the monument resumed in 1923. The influence of the UDC continued, in support of Mrs. Plane's vision of a carving explicitly for the purpose of creating a Confederate memorial. She suggested in a letter to the first sculptor, <a>Gutzon Borglum</a>:

</p>
<p>
The UDC established the Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial Association (SMCMA) for fundraising and on-site supervision of the project. Venable and Borglum, both closely associated with the Klan, arranged to pack the SMCMA with Klan members.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> The SMCMA, along with the <a>United Daughters of the Confederacy</a>, continued fundraising efforts. Of the $250,000 raised, part came from the federal government, which in 1925 issued special <a>fifty-cent coins</a> with the soldiers Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson on them.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>  The image on the <a>verso</a> of the coin was based on <i>The Last Meeting of Lee and Jackson</i>,<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> executed in 1869 by Everett B. D. Fabrino Julio (American, b. <a>St. Helena</a> 1843 – 1879, emigrated to the U.S. 1860), itself an icon of <a>Lost Cause</a> mythology; it is now in the <a>American Civil War Museum</a> (until 2012 the Museum of the Confederacy).<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> When the state completed the purchase in 1960, it <a>condemned</a> the property to void Venable's agreement to allow the Klan perpetual right to hold meetings on the premises.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>

<p>
After the <a>Charleston church shooting</a> in mid-2015, Stone Mountain was the subject of a political debate related to the removal of symbols of the <a>Confederacy</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> This controversy was stimulated by a movement in other states to remove the <a>Confederate battle flag</a> and statues of Confederate leaders from public areas.

</p>
<p>
In July 2015, the Atlanta NAACP proposed removing the Confederate carving from Stone Mountain Park.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> However, this would require the approval of the <a>Georgia Legislature</a>, as would any change to a "military monument" in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On October 11, 2015, <i><a>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a></i> reported the park was considering a proposal of a permanent "Freedom Bell" honoring <a>Martin Luther King Jr.</a> and the line "Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia", from King's 1963 "<a>I Have a Dream</a>" speech.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> The proposed monument is inspired by a bell-ringing ceremony held in 2013 honoring the 50th anniversary of King's speech. It is not supported by the <a>NAACP</a> or King-founded <a>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC), who want the Confederate symbols removed rather than a King symbol added.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> Advance Local reported in 2015 that both the DeKalb County branch of the NAACP and the <a>Sons of Confederate Veterans</a> were opposed to the bell because it would have been put next to a Confederate monument. Representatives of the NAACP were quoted in the article saying "It's an attempt to gain support from blacks to keep these racist and demeaning symbols."<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><sup>[<i><a><span>needs update</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>

In August 2017, after the <a>Unite the Right rally</a> in <a>Charlottesville, Virginia</a>—a <a>white nationalist</a> protest against the removal of the <a>Robert E. Lee monument</a> and <a>Stonewall Jackson sculpture</a>—turned violent, many people across the country again demanded the removal of many Confederate monuments and memorials as a part of a national political debate.<sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup> Georgia State Representative and Democratic gubernatorial candidate <a>Stacey Abrams</a> called for the removal, by <a>sandblasting</a>, of Stone Mountain's carving.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup> She called it "a blight upon our state".<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On July 5, 2020, 100 to 200 armed protesters came to Stone Mountain to call for the carving's removal.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> Known as the <a>Not Fucking Around Coalition</a> (NFAC), it was a protest against both overt and systemic racism, calling out white supremacists, with the location being chosen in part due to its history as the place where the Ku Klux Klan was re-formed.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On August 15, 2020, the park administration closed its gates in reaction to a gathering of white nationalists planned there, and the city's public buses were suspended for the day. Nevertheless a fight broke out between the gatherers downtown and counter-protesters downtown, with no injuries.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>

<p>
Human habitation of Stone Mountain and its surroundings date back into <a>prehistory</a>. When the mountain was first encountered by <a>European</a> explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's <a>Fort Mountain</a>. The wall is believed to have been built by early <a>Native American</a> inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear. By the beginning of the 20th century, the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation.  The mountain was the eastern end of the Campbellton Trail, a <a>Native American</a> path that ran through what is now the <a>Atlanta</a> area.

</p>
<p>
Europeans first learned of the mountain in 1567, when <a>Spanish</a> explorers were told of a mountain farther inland which was "very high, shining when the sun set like a fire."<sup>[<i><a><span>further explanation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the <a>Creek</a> and (to a lesser extent) <a>Cherokee</a> peoples.

</p>
<p>
In the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain.  After the founding of DeKalb County and the <a>county seat</a> of <a>Decatur</a> in 1822, Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young couples on dates to ride to the mountain on horseback. The mountain is easy to climb and there has been a path since the nineteenth century.

</p>
<p>
Entrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a 165 feet (50 m) wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the 1.1-mile (1.8 km) mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.

</p>
<p>
Granite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the <a>Georgia Railroad</a> in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the <a>Panama Canal</a>, the steps to the East Wing of the <a>United States Capitol</a> and the <a>Imperial Hotel</a> in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the group responsible for planning the <a>Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial</a> in Washington, D.C.; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.

</p>
<p>
In 1887, Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in 1958.

</p>
<p>
<a>Martin Luther King Jr.</a> mentioned the monument in his "<a>I Have a Dream</a>" speech at the August 1963 <a>March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom</a>, when he said "let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!"<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
During the <a>1996 Summer Olympics</a>, Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, <a>archery</a> and <a>track cycling</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Some of the outdoor scenes for the <a>Netflix</a> series <i><a>Stranger Things</a></i> were filmed in the park.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>

<p>
According to George Weiblen's annotated calendar for Monday, May 7, 1928: "Mail plane crashed on mountain at 8:00 P.M."<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The pilot, Johnny S. Kytle (1905–1931), not only survived the crash, but managed to grab the mail and walk down the mountain.

</p>
<p>
Around dusk on September 16, 2003, in clear weather, a small airplane circled the mountain five times, crashed headlong into the south side, and burst into flames. The pilot was killed. A witness testifying at the <a>NTSB</a> investigation stated that the pilot, a 69-year-old accountant, had threatened on multiple occasions to commit suicide by flying into the mountain. The official NTSB accident report lists the probable cause as "The pilot's intentional flight into the ground for the purpose of suicide while impaired by alcohol."<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup>

Stone Mountain Park, which surrounds the Confederate Memorial, is owned by the state of Georgia and managed by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, a Georgia state authority.  The <a>Herschend Family Entertainment Corporation</a> has a long-term contract to operate park attractions while the Stone Mountain Memorial Association retains ownership and the right to reject any project deemed unfit. Under terms of a 1999 agreement, Herschend pays the state of Georgia $11 million annually.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> The park is the largest attraction operated by privately-held Herschend, which also manages several dozen other attractions including <a>Dollywood</a> in <a>Pigeon Forge, Tennessee</a>, and <a>Silver Dollar City</a> in <a>Branson, Missouri</a>. The company's CEO said in a 2012 news interview that the contract to operate Stone Mountain extended another 35 years.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

Archived from <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898581,00.html">the original</a> on August 19, 2008. <q>An itinerant Methodist preacher named William Joseph Simmons started up the Klan again in Atlanta in 1915. Simmons, an ascetic-looking man, was a fetishist on fraternal organizations. He was already a "colonel" in the Woodmen of the World, but he decided to build an organization all his own. He was an effective speaker, with an affinity for alliteration; he had preached on "Women, Weddings and Wives," "Red Heads, Dead Heads and No Heads," and the "Kinship of Kourtship and Kissing." On Thanksgiving Eve 1915, Simmons took 15 friends to the top of Stone Mountain, near Atlanta, built an altar on which he placed an American flag, a Bible and an unsheathed sword, set fire to a crude wooden cross, muttered a few incantations about a "practical fraternity among men," and declared himself Imperial Wizard of the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.</q>
