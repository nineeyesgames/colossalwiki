<p>The site is a sandstone rock formation that was carved by the waves of the Pacific Ocean. The rocks are composed of dacite porphyry and basalt. The sandstone is metamorphic rock. The rock was formed during the Miocene era. The rock was uplifted during the late Cenozoic era. The rocks have been eroded by the ocean which formed the cliffs. The rock was formed from a layer of lava that covered the area.</p>
<p>The site is part of the Tillamook State Forest. It is part of the Coastal Western Hemlock-Sitka Spruce forests ecoregion.</p>
<p>The site has a considerable amount of plant life. The plant life has a rich biodiversity.
