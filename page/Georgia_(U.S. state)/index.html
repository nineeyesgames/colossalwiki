<p>
<b>Georgia</b> is a <a>state</a> in the <a>Southeastern</a> region of the <a>United States</a>, bordered to the north by <a>Tennessee</a> and <a>North Carolina</a>; to the northeast by <a>South Carolina</a>; to the southeast by the <a>Atlantic Ocean</a>; to the south by <a>Florida</a>; and to the west by <a>Alabama</a>. Georgia is the <a>24th-largest in area</a> and <a>8th-most populous</a> of the <a>50 United States</a>. Its 2020 population was 10,711,908, according to the <a>U.S. Census Bureau</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup><a>Atlanta</a> , a "<a>beta(+)</a>" global city, is both the state's <a>capital</a> and its largest city. The <a>Atlanta metropolitan area</a>, with a population of more than 6 million people in 2020, is the <a>9th most populous metropolitan area</a> in the United States and contains about 57% of Georgia's entire population.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Founded in 1732 as the <a>Province of Georgia</a> and becoming a <a>royal colony</a> in 1752, Georgia was the last and southernmost of the original <a>Thirteen Colonies</a> to be established.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> Named after King <a>George II of Great Britain</a>, the Colony of Georgia covered the area from South Carolina south to <a>Spanish Florida</a> and west to <a>French Louisiana</a> at the <a>Mississippi River</a>. On January 2, 1788, Georgia became the fourth state to <a>ratify</a> the <a>United States Constitution</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> From 1802 to 1804, western Georgia was split to form the <a>Mississippi Territory</a>, which later was admitted as the U.S. states of <a>Alabama</a> and <a>Mississippi</a>. Georgia declared its <a>secession</a> from the Union on January 19, 1861, and was one of the original seven <a>Confederate States</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Following the <a>Civil War</a>, it was the last state to be restored to the Union, on July 15, 1870.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> In the post-<a>Reconstruction</a> era, Georgia's economy was transformed as a group of prominent politicians, businessmen, and journalists, led by <a>Henry W. Grady</a>, espoused the "<a>New South</a>" philosophy of sectional reconciliation, <a>industrialization</a>, and <a>white supremacy</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> During the 20th century, several Georgians, most notably <a>Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, were prominent leaders during the <a>civil rights movement</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> Since 1945, Georgia has seen substantial population growth as part of the broader <a>Sun Belt</a> phenomenon. From 2007 to 2008, 14 of <a>Georgia's counties</a> ranked among the nation's 100 fastest-growing.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Georgia is defined by a diversity of landscapes, flora, and fauna. The state's northernmost regions include the <a>Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, part of the larger <a>Appalachian Mountain</a> system. The <a>Piedmont</a> plateau extends from the <a>foothills</a> of the Blue Ridge south to the <a>Fall Line</a>, an <a>escarpment</a> to the <a>Coastal Plain</a> defining the state's southern region. Georgia's highest point is <a>Brasstown Bald</a> at 4,784 feet (1,458 m) above sea level; the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean. With the exception of some high-altitude areas in the Blue Ridge, the entirety of the state has a <a>humid subtropical climate</a>. Of the states entirely east of the Mississippi River, Georgia is the largest in <a>land area</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>

<p>
Before settlement by Europeans, Georgia was inhabited by the <a>mound building</a> cultures. The British colony of Georgia was founded by <a>James Oglethorpe</a> on February 12, 1733.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> The colony was administered by the <a>Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America</a> under a charter issued by (and named for) <a>King George II</a>. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony's settlement, known as the <a>Oglethorpe Plan</a>, which envisioned an agrarian society of <a>yeoman farmers</a> and prohibited slavery. The colony was <a>invaded by the Spanish</a> in 1742, during the <a>War of Jenkins' Ear</a>. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the <a>crown</a>. Georgia became a <a>crown colony</a>, with a governor appointed by the king.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Province of Georgia</a> was one of the <a>Thirteen Colonies</a> that revolted against <a>British</a> rule in the <a>American Revolution</a> by signing the 1776 <a>Declaration of Independence</a>. The State of Georgia's first constitution was ratified in February 1777. Georgia was the 10th state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on July 24, 1778,<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> and was the 4th state to ratify the <a>United States Constitution</a> on January 2, 1788.

</p>
<p>
After the <a>Creek War (1813–1814)</a>, General <a>Andrew Jackson</a> forced the <a>Muscogee (Creek) tribes</a> to surrender land to the state of Georgia, including in the <a>Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814)</a>, surrendering 21 million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama, and the <a>Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> In 1829, gold was discovered in the <a>North Georgia mountains</a> leading to the <a>Georgia Gold Rush</a> and establishment of a <a>federal mint</a> in <a>Dahlonega</a>, which continued in operation until 1861. The resulting influx of white settlers put pressure on the government to take land from the <a>Cherokee Nation</a>. In 1830, <a>President</a><a>Andrew Jackson</a>  signed the <a>Indian Removal Act</a>, sending many eastern Native American nations to <a>reservations</a> in present-day Oklahoma, including all of Georgia's tribes. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in <i><a>Worcester v. Georgia</a></i> (1832) that U.S. states were not permitted to redraw Indian boundaries, President Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, <a>Martin Van Buren</a>, dispatched federal troops to gather the tribes and deport them west of the <a>Mississippi</a>. This forced relocation, known as the <a>Trail of Tears</a>, led to the death of more than four thousand Cherokees.

<p>
In early 1861, Georgia joined the <a>Confederacy</a> (with secessionists having a slight majority of delegates)<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> and became a major <a>theater</a> of the <a>Civil War</a>. Major battles took place at <a>Chickamauga</a>, <a>Kennesaw Mountain</a>, and <a>Atlanta</a>. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from <a>Atlanta</a> to <a>Savannah</a> was destroyed during General <a>William Tecumseh Sherman</a>'s <a>March to the Sea</a>. 18,253 Georgian soldiers died in service, roughly one of every five who served.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> In 1870, following the <a>Reconstruction Era</a>, Georgia became the last Confederate state to be restored to the <a>Union</a>.

</p>
<p>
With white Democrats having regained power in the state legislature, they passed a <a>poll tax</a> in 1877, which <a>disenfranchised</a> many poor blacks and whites, preventing them from registering.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> In 1908, the state established a <a>white primary</a>; with the only competitive contests within the Democratic Party, it was another way to exclude blacks from politics.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> They constituted 46.7% of the state's population in 1900, but the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American dropped thereafter to 28%, primarily due to tens of thousands leaving the state during the <a>Great Migration</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> According to the <a>Equal Justice Institute</a>'s 2015 report on lynching in the United States (1877–1950), Georgia had 531 deaths, the second-highest total of these extralegal executions of any state in the South. The overwhelming number of victims were black and male.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> Political disfranchisement persisted through the mid-1960s, until after Congress passed the <a>Voting Rights Act of 1965</a>.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/MLK_Memorial_in_Atlanta%2C_Georgia_by_George_Paul_Puvvada..jpg/220px-MLK_Memorial_in_Atlanta%2C_Georgia_by_George_Paul_Puvvada..jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
An Atlanta-born <a>Baptist minister</a> who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta's African-American community, <a>Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, emerged as a national leader in the <a>civil rights movement</a>. King joined with others to form the <a>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> (SCLC) in Atlanta in 1957 to provide political leadership for the Civil Rights Movement across the South. The civil rights riots of the <a>1956 Sugar Bowl</a> would also take place in <a>Atlanta</a> after a clash between <a>Georgia Tech</a>'s president <a>Blake R Van Leer</a> and Governor <a>Marvin Griffin</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On February 5, 1958, during a training mission flown by a <a>B-47</a>, a <a>Mark 15 nuclear bomb</a>, also known as the <a>Tybee Bomb</a>, was lost off the coast of <a>Tybee Island</a> near Savannah. The bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried in silt at the bottom of <a>Wassaw Sound</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to 28% of the state's population, after waves of migration to the North and some in-migration by whites.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> With their voting power diminished, it took some years for African Americans to win a state-wide office. <a>Julian Bond</a>, a noted civil rights leader, was elected to the state House in 1965, and served multiple terms there and in the state senate.

</p>
<p>
Atlanta Mayor <a>Ivan Allen, Jr.</a> testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act, and Governor <a>Carl Sanders</a> worked with the <a>Kennedy</a> administration to ensure the state's compliance. <a>Ralph McGill</a>, editor and syndicated columnist at the <i><a>Atlanta Constitution</a></i>, earned admiration by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1970, newly elected Governor <a>Jimmy Carter</a> declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended. In 1972, Georgians elected <a>Andrew Young</a> to Congress as the first African American Congressman since the <a>Reconstruction era</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1980, construction was completed on an expansion of what is now named <a>Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport</a> (ATL). The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than a hundred million passengers annually.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Employing more than 60,000 people, the airport became a major engine for economic growth.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> With the advantages of cheap real estate, low taxes, <a>right-to-work laws</a> and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area became a national center of <a>finance</a>, <a>insurance</a>, <a>technology</a>, <a>manufacturing</a>, <a>real estate</a>, <a>logistics</a>, and <a>transportation</a> companies, as well as the film, convention, and trade show businesses. As a testament to the city's growing international profile, in 1990 the <a>International Olympic Committee</a> selected <a>Atlanta</a> as the site of the <a>1996 Summer Olympics</a>. Taking advantage of Atlanta's status as a transportation hub, in 1991 <a>UPS</a> established its headquarters in the suburb of <a>Sandy Springs</a>. In 1992, construction finished on <a>Bank of America Plaza</a>, the tallest building in the U.S. outside of New York or Chicago.

<h3 id="Boundaries">Boundaries</h3>
<p>
Beginning from the Atlantic Ocean, the state's eastern border with South Carolina runs up the <a>Savannah River</a>, northwest to its origin at the <a>confluence</a> of the <a>Tugaloo</a> and <a>Seneca Rivers</a>. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the <a>Chattooga River</a>, its most significant <a>tributary</a>. These bounds were decided in the 1797 <a>Treaty of Beaufort</a>, and tested in the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> in the two <i><a>Georgia v. South Carolina</a></i> cases in 1923 and 1989.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of <a>Rabun County</a>, at <a>latitude 35°N</a>, though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey, conducted in 1818).<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the <a>Mississippi River</a>, until <a>Tennessee</a> was divided from <a>North Carolina</a>, and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia's territory presently comprising <a>Alabama</a> and <a>Mississippi</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state's western border runs in a straight line south-southeastward from a point southwest of <a>Chattanooga</a>, to meet the <a>Chattahoochee River</a> near <a>West Point</a>. It continues downriver to the point where it joins the <a>Flint River</a> (the confluence of the two forming Florida's <a>Apalachicola River</a>); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the <a>St. Mary's River</a>, which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
The water boundaries are still set to be the original <a>thalweg</a> of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the <a>Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint</a> point now under <a>Lake Seminole</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
An 1818 survey erroneously placed Georgia's border with Tennessee one mile (1.6 km) south of the intended location of the 35th parallel north.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> State legislators <a>still dispute this placement</a>, as correction of this inaccuracy would allow Georgia access to water from the <a>Tennessee River</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>

<p>
Georgia consists of five principal <a>physiographic regions</a>: The <a>Cumberland Plateau</a>, <a>Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians</a>, <a>Blue Ridge Mountains</a>, <a>Piedmont</a>, and the <a>Atlantic coastal plain</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the  region, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale, and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal.

<h3 id="Flora">Flora</h3>
<p>
The state of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia's native trees include <a>red cedar</a>, a variety of pines, oaks, hollies, <a>cypress</a>, <a>sweetgum</a>, scaly-bark and white <a>hickories</a>, and <a>sabal palmetto</a>. East Georgia is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and conifer species as other broadleaf evergreen flora make up the majority of the southern and coastal regions. <a>Yellow jasmine</a> and <a>mountain laurel</a> make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state.

</p>
<h3 id="Fauna">Fauna</h3>
<p>
<a>White-tailed deer</a> are found in nearly all counties of Georgia. The <a>northern mockingbird</a> and <a>brown thrasher</a> are among the 160 bird species that live in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Reptiles include the <a>eastern diamondback</a>, <a>copperhead</a>, and <a>cottonmouth</a> snakes as well as <a>alligators</a>; amphibians include <a>salamanders</a>, <a>frogs</a> and <a>toads</a>. There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> The Argentine black and white tegu is currently an invasive species in Georgia. It poses a problem to local wildlife by chasing down and killing many native species and dominating habitats.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The most popular freshwater game fish are <a>trout</a>, <a>bream</a>, <a>bass</a>, and <a>catfish</a>, all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include <a>red drum</a>, <a>spotted seatrout</a>, <a>flounder</a>, and <a>tarpon</a>. <a>Porpoises</a>, whales, <a>shrimp</a>, <a>oysters</a>, and <a>blue crabs</a> are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>

<p>
The majority of the state is primarily a <a>humid subtropical climate</a>. Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the <a>North Georgia mountains</a>, receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45 inches (1143 mm) in central Georgia<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup> to approximately 75 inches (1905 mm) around the northeast part of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or <a>Gulf of Mexico</a>, and the elevation. The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state, which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level. The USDA plant <a>hardiness zones</a> for Georgia range from zone 6b (no colder than −5 °F (−21 °C)) in the <a>Blue Ridge Mountains</a> to zone 8b (no colder than 15 °F (−9 °C) ) along the <a>Atlantic</a> coast and Florida border.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The highest temperature ever recorded is 112 °F (44.4 °C) in <a>Louisville</a> on July 24, 1952,<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> while the lowest is −17 °F (−27.2 °C) in northern <a>Floyd County</a> on January 27, 1940.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> Georgia is one of the leading states in frequency of <a>tornadoes</a>, though they are rarely stronger than <a>EF1</a>. Although tornadoes striking the city are very rare,<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> an EF2 tornado<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings. With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to <a>hurricanes</a>, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike the <a>Florida Panhandle</a>, weaken over land, and bring strong <a>tropical storm</a> winds and heavy rain to the interior, a recent example being <a>Hurricane Michael</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their way north without ever making landfall. <a>Hurricane Matthew of 2016</a> and <a>Hurricane Dorian of 2019</a> did just that.

</p>
<p>
Due to anthropogenic <a>climate change</a>, the climate of Georgia is warming. This is already causing major disruption, for example, from sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable to it than many other states because its land is sinking) and further warming will increase it.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>

As of 2010<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, the number of <a>illegal immigrants</a> living in Georgia more than doubled to 480,000 from January 2000 to January 2009, according to a federal report. That gave Georgia the greatest percentage increase among the 10 states with the biggest illegal immigrant populations during those years.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Georgia has banned <a>sanctuary cities</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>

<p>
There were 743,000 <a>veterans</a> in 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As of 2011<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, 58.8% of Georgia's population younger than 1 were minorities (meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white) compared to other states like California with 75.1%, New York with 55.6%, and Texas with 69.8%.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>

The largest European ancestry groups are:

</p>

<p>
In the 1980 census 1,584,303 Georgians claimed <a>English</a> ancestry out of a total state population of 3,994,817, making them 40% of the state, and the largest ethnic group at the time.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> Today, many of these same people claiming they are of "American" ancestry are actually of English descent, and some are of <a>Scots-Irish</a> descent; however, their families have lived in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify simply as having "American" ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry. Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original thirteen colonies and for this reason many of them today simply claim "American" ancestry, though they are of predominantly English ancestry.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As of 2004<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, 7.7% of Georgia's population was reported as under 5<span></span>years of age, 26.4% under 18, and 9.6% were 65 or older. Also, as of 2004<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, females made up approximately 50.6% of the population and African Americans made up approximately 29.6%.

</p>
<p>
Historically, about half of Georgia's population was composed of African Americans who, before the Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved. The <a>Great Migration</a> of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African American population.<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Georgia had the second-fastest-growing Asian population growth in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000, more than doubling in size during the ten-year period.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percent of the total population that is African American (after <a>Mississippi</a> and <a>Louisiana</a>) and third in numeric Black population after New York and Florida.

</p>
<p>
Georgia is the state with the third-lowest percentage of older people (65 or older), at 12.8 percent (as of 2015<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>).<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The colonial settlement of large numbers of <a>Scottish American</a>, <a>English American</a> and <a>Scotch-Irish Americans</a> in the mountains and piedmont, and coastal settlement by some <a>English Americans</a> and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music. The concentration of Africans imported to coastal areas in the 18th century repeatedly from rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of <a>Gullah</a>-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which many African traditions of food, religion and culture were retained. In the creolization of Southern culture, their foodways became an integral part of Low Country cooking.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup>

As of 2010<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>, 87.35% (7,666,663) of Georgia residents age<span></span>5 and older spoke <a>English</a> at home as a <a>primary language</a>, while 7.42% (651,583) spoke <a>Spanish</a>, 0.51% (44,702) <a>Korean</a>, 0.44% (38,244) <a>Vietnamese</a>, 0.42% (36,679) <a>French</a>, 0.38% (33,009) <a>Chinese</a> (which includes <a>Mandarin</a>), and <a>German</a>, which was spoken as a <a>main language</a> by 0.29% (23,351) of the population over the age of <span></span>5.

Along with the rest of the Southeast, Georgia's population continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas. The U.S. Census Bureau lists <a>fourteen metropolitan areas</a> in the state. The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area added 1.23 million people (24 percent) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta rose in rank from the eleventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States to the ninth-largest.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup>

<p>
As with all other U.S. states and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the <a>separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Executive authority in the state rests with the <a>governor</a>, currently <a>Brian Kemp</a> (<a>Republican</a>). Both the <a>Governor of Georgia</a> and <a>lieutenant governor</a> are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor.

</p>
<p>
Legislative authority resides in the <a>General Assembly</a>, composed of the <a>Senate</a> and <a>House of Representatives</a>. The Lieutenant Governor <a>presides over the Senate</a>, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker. The <a>Georgia Constitution</a> mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> The laws enacted by the General Assembly are codified in the <a>Official Code of Georgia Annotated</a>.

</p>
<p>
State judicial authority rests with the state <a>Supreme Court</a> and <a>Court of Appeals</a>, which have statewide authority.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including Superior Courts, State Courts, Juvenile Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction.

</p>
<h3 id="Local_government">Local government</h3>
<div>Further information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Georgia">List of counties in Georgia</a></div>
<p>
Georgia consists of 159 <a>counties</a>, second only to Texas, with 254.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> Georgia had 161 counties until the end of 1931, when <a>Milton</a> and <a>Campbell</a> were merged into the existing <a>Fulton</a>. Some counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many bear names with Native American origin. Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup> Several counties have a <a>sole Commissioner</a> form of government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person. Georgia is the only state with current Sole Commissioner counties. Georgia's Constitution provides all counties and cities with "<a>home rule</a>" authority. The county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county, as a municipality would.

</p>
<p>
Georgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for <a>townships</a> or <a>independent cities</a>, though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships;<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> it does allow <a>consolidated city-county</a> governments by local <a>referendum</a>. All of Georgia's second-tier cities except <a>Savannah</a> have now formed consolidated city-county governments by referendum: <a>Columbus</a> (in 1970), <a>Athens</a> (1990), <a>Augusta</a> (1995), and <a>Macon</a> (2012). (Augusta and Athens have excluded one or more small, incorporated towns within their consolidated boundaries; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all smaller incorporated entities within their consolidated boundaries.) The small town of <a>Cusseta</a> adopted a consolidated city-county government after it merged with unincorporated <a>Chattahoochee County</a> in 2003. Three years later, in 2006, the town of <a>Georgetown</a> consolidated with the rest of <a>Quitman County</a>.

</p>
<p>
There is no true <a>metropolitan government</a> in Georgia, though the <a>Atlanta Regional Commission</a> (ARC) and <a>Georgia Regional Transportation Authority</a> do provide some services, and the ARC must approve all major <a>land development</a> projects in the <a>Atlanta metropolitan area</a>.

<p>
Georgia had voted <a>Republican</a> in six consecutive presidential elections from <a>1996</a> to <a>2016</a>, a streak that was broken when the state went for <a>Democratic</a> candidate <a>Joe Biden</a> in <a>2020</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until 1964, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the <a>Democratic Party</a>, of any state in the Union. This record was established largely due to the <a>disenfranchisement of most blacks</a> and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
White Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup> In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, nearly half of the state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also: (a) be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, (b) be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or (c) own at least 40 acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the <a>American Revolution</a> through the <a>Spanish–American War</a> was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because by 1908 many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans and/or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, and literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup> In the early 20th century, <a>Progressives</a> promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> White one-party rule was solidified.

</p>
<p>
For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup> Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were <a>Southern Democrats</a>, who were fiscally and socially conservative by national standards.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup> This voting pattern continued after the segregationist period.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Legal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the <a>Great Migration</a> to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup> In the decades since the late 20th century, the conservative white-majority voters have increasingly supported Republicans for national and state offices.

</p>
<p>
In 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor <a>Roy Barnes</a> was defeated by Republican <a>Sonny Perdue</a>, a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government.

</p>
<p>
Even before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son <a>Jimmy Carter</a> carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor <a>Bill Clinton</a> narrowly won the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman <a>Larry McDonald</a>, former head of the <a>John Birch Society</a>, who died when the <a>Soviet Union</a> shot down <a>KAL 007</a> near <a>Sakhalin Island</a>. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup> as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state.

</p>
<p>
The ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia <a>U.S. House of Representatives</a> member <a>Newt Gingrich</a> being elected as <a>Speaker of the House</a> following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries.

</p>
<p>
In 2008, Democrat <a>Jim Martin</a> ran against incumbent Republican Senator <a>Saxby Chambliss</a>. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the <a>runoff election</a> held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.

</p>
<p>
In the 2018 elections, the <a>governor</a> remained a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a democratic <a>black</a><a>female</a> , <a>Stacey Abrams</a>), Republicans lost eight seats in the <a>Georgia House of Representatives</a> (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the <a>Georgia Senate</a> (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat <a>U.S. Representatives</a> were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup>
</p>

In the three presidential elections up to and including 2016, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as <a>Michigan</a>, <a>Ohio</a> and <a>Wisconsin</a>. This trend led to the state electing Democrat <a>Joe Biden</a> for president in 2020, and it coming to be regarded as a <a>swing state</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup>

<p>
During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in <i><a>Wesberry v. Sanders</a></i> (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations.

</p>
<p>
A related case, <i><a>Reynolds v. Sims</a></i> (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of "one man, one vote"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.<sup><a href="#ref_98">[98]</a></sup> From the mid-1960s, the voting electorate increased after African Americans' rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law.

</p>
<p>
Economic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region. It was a bedrock of the emerging "<a>New South</a>". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state.

</p>
<p>
In the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor <a>Zell Miller</a>, decided to support Republicans. The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for measures such as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning <a>same-sex marriages</a> was approved by 76% of voters.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup> However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in <i><a>Obergefell v. Hodges</a></i>, all Georgia counties came into full compliance, recognizing the rights of same-sex couples to marry in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In <a>presidential elections</a>, Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from <a>1900</a> to <a>1960</a>. In <a>1964</a>, it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican <a>Barry Goldwater</a> over Democrat <a>Lyndon B. Johnson</a>. In <a>1968</a>, it did not vote for either of the two parties, but rather the <a>American Independent Party</a> and its nominee, <a>Alabama</a> Governor <a>George Wallace</a>. In <a>1972</a>, the state returned to Republicans as part of a landslide victory for <a>Richard Nixon</a>. In <a>1976</a> and <a>1980</a>, it voted for Democrat and former Georgia governor <a>Jimmy Carter</a>. The state returned to Republicans in <a>1984</a> and <a>1988</a>, before going Democratic once again in <a>1992</a>. For every election between that year and <a>2020</a>, Georgia voted heavily Republican, in line with many of its neighbors in the <a>Deep South</a>. In <a>2020</a>, it voted Democratic for the first time in 28 years, aiding <a>Joe Biden</a> in his defeat of incumbent Republican <a>Donald Trump</a>. Prior to 2020, Republicans in state, federal and congressional races had seen decreasing margins of victory, and many election forecasts had ranked Georgia as a "toss-up" state, or with Biden as a very narrow favorite.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup> Concurrent with the 2020 presidential election were two elections for both of Georgia's United States Senate seats (one of which being a special election due to the resignation of Senator <a>Johnny Isakson</a>, and the other being regularly scheduled). After no candidate in either race received a majority of the vote, both went to January 5, 2021, run-offs, which Democrats <a>Jon Ossoff</a> and <a>Raphael Warnock</a> won. Ossoff is the state's first Jewish senator, and Warnock is the state's first Black senator. Biden's, Ossoff's, and Warnock's wins were attributed to the rapid <a>diversification</a> of the suburbs of Atlanta<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> and increased turnout of younger <a>African American</a> voters, particularly around the suburbs of Atlanta and in <a>Savannah, Georgia</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_104">[104]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup>

Georgia high schools (grades nine through twelve) are required to administer a <a>standardized</a>, <a>multiple choice</a><a>End of Course Test</a> , or EOCT, in each of eight core subjects: <a>algebra</a>, <a>geometry</a>, <a>U.S. history</a>, economics, <a>biology</a>, <a>physical science</a>, ninth grade literature and <a>composition</a>, and <a>American literature</a>. The official purpose of the tests is to assess "specific content knowledge and skills". Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive <a>credit</a> in the course, completion of the test is mandatory. The EOCT score accounts for 15% of a student's grade in the course.<sup><a href="#ref_156">[156]</a></sup> The <i>Georgia Milestone</i> evaluation is taken by public school students in the state.<sup><a href="#ref_157">[157]</a></sup> In 2020, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia State BOE agreed to state superintendent Richard Woods’ proposal to change the weight of the EOCT test to only count for 0.01% of the Student's course grade.
