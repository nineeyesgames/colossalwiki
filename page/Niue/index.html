<p>
<b>Niue</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>ˈ</span><span>nj</span><span>uː</span><span>eɪ</span></span>/</a></span></span> or <span><span><a>/<span><span>n</span><span>iː</span><span>ˈ</span><span>juː</span><span>eɪ</span></span>/</a></span></span>; <a>Niuean</a>: <i>Niuē</i>) is an <a>island country</a> in the <a>South Pacific Ocean</a>, 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) northeast of <a>New Zealand</a>. Niue's land area is about 261 square kilometres (101 sq mi)<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> and its population, predominantly <a>Polynesian</a>, was about 1,600 in 2016. Niue is located in a triangle between <a>Tonga</a>, <a>Samoa</a>, and the <a>Cook Islands</a>. It is 604 kilometers northeast of Tonga. The island is commonly referred to as "The Rock", which comes from the traditional name "Rock of <a>Polynesia</a>".<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Niue is one of the world's largest <a>coral islands</a>. The <a>terrain</a> of the island has two noticeable levels. The higher level is made up of a <a>limestone</a><a>cliff</a>  running along the coast, with a plateau in the centre of the island reaching approximately 60 metres (200 feet) above sea level. The lower level is a coastal terrace approximately 0.5 km (0.3 miles) wide and about 25–27 metres (80–90 feet) high, which slopes down and meets the sea in small cliffs. A <a>coral reef</a> surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to the capital, <a>Alofi</a>.

</p>
<p>
Niue is a <a>self-governing</a> state in <a>free association</a> with <a>New Zealand</a>, and New Zealand conducts most diplomatic relations on its behalf. As part of the <a>Realm of New Zealand</a>, Niueans are citizens of New Zealand and <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a> is Niue's <a>head of state</a> in her capacity as <a>Queen of New Zealand</a>. Between 90% and 95% of Niuean people live in New Zealand,<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> along with about 70% of the speakers of the <a>Niuean language</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> Niue is a <a>bilingual country</a>, with 30% of the population speaking both Niuean and <a>English</a>. The percentage of monolingual English-speaking people is only 11%, while 46% are monolingual Niuean speakers.

</p>
<p>
Niue is not a member of the <a>United Nations</a> (UN), but UN organisations have accepted its status as a freely-associated state as equivalent to independence for the purposes of international law.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> As such, Niue is a member of some <a>UN specialised agencies</a> (such as <a>UNESCO</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> and the <a>WHO</a>),<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> and is invited, alongside the other non-UN member state, the <a>Cook Islands</a>, to attend United Nations conferences open to "all states".<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Niue has been a member of the <a>Pacific Community</a> since 1980.

</p>
<p>
Niue is <a>subdivided into 14 <i>villages</i></a> (<a>municipalities</a>). Each village has a council that elects its chairperson. The villages are at the same time electoral districts; each village sends an assemblyperson to the <a>Parliament of Niue</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> A small and <a>democratic nation</a>, <a>Niueans</a> hold legislative <a>elections every three years</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <i>Niue Integrated Strategic Plan</i> (NISP), adopted in 2003, is the national development plan, setting national priorities for development in areas such as financial sustainability. Since the late 20th century Niue has become a leader in <a>green growth</a>; the <a>European Union</a> is helping the nation convert to <a>renewable energy</a>. In January 2004, Niue was hit by <a>Cyclone Heta</a>, which caused extensive damage to the island, including wiping out most of South Alofi. The disaster set the island back about two years from its planned timeline to implement the NISP since national efforts concentrated on recovery.

<p>
<a>Polynesians</a> from <a>Samoa</a> settled Niue around 900 AD. Further settlers arrived from <a>Tonga</a> in the 16th century.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until the beginning of the 18th century, Niue appears to have had no national government or national <a>leader</a>; chiefs and heads of families exercised authority over segments of the population. <a>A succession of <i>patu-iki</i> (kings) ruled</a>, beginning with Puni-mata. Tui-toga, who reigned from 1875 to 1887, was the first Christian king.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Stamp_niue_0%2C5_d.jpg/170px-Stamp_niue_0%2C5_d.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The first Europeans to sight Niue sailed under Captain <a>James Cook</a> in 1774. Cook made three attempts to land, but the inhabitants refused to grant permission to do so. He named the island "Savage Island" because, as legend has it, the natives who "greeted" him were painted in what appeared to be blood. The substance on their teeth was hulahula, a native red <a>fe'i banana</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> For the next couple of centuries, Niue was known as Savage Island until its original name, "Niue", which translates as "behold the coconut",<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup> regained use.

</p>
<p>
Whaling vessels were some of the most regular visitors to the island in the nineteenth century. The first on record was the <i>Fanny</i> in February 1824. The last known whaler to visit was the <i>Albatross</i> in November 1899.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The next notable European visitors represented the <a>London Missionary Society</a>; they arrived on the <i>Messenger of Peace</i>. After many years of trying to land a European missionary, they abducted a Niuean named <a>Nukai Peniamina</a> and trained him as a <a>pastor</a> at the <a>Malua</a> Theological College in Samoa.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup> Peniamina returned in 1846 on the <i><a>John Williams</a></i> as a missionary with the help of Toimata Fakafitifonua. He was finally allowed to land in Uluvehi <a>Mutalau</a> after a number of attempts in other villages had failed. The chiefs of Mutalau village allowed him to land and assigned over 60 warriors to protect him day and night at the fort in Fupiu.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f1/Richard_Seddon_and_the_King_of_Niue.jpg/220px-Richard_Seddon_and_the_King_of_Niue.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
In July 1849 <a>Captain John Erskine</a> visited the island in <a>HMS <i>Havannah</i></a>.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Christianity was first taught to the Mutalau people before it spread to all the villages. Originally other major villages opposed the introduction of Christianity and had sought to kill Peniamina. The people from the village of Hakupu, although the last village to receive Christianity, came and asked for a "word of God"; hence, their village was renamed "Ha Kupu Atua" meaning "any word of God", or "Hakupu" for short.

</p>
<p>
In 1889 the chiefs and rulers of Niue, in a letter to <a>Queen Victoria</a>, asked her "to stretch out towards us your mighty hand, that Niue may hide herself in it and be safe".<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> After expressing anxiety lest some other nation should take possession of the island, the letter continued: "We leave it with you to do as seems best to you. If you send the flag of Britain that is well; or if you send a Commissioner to reside among us, that will be well".<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> The British did not initially take up the offer. In 1900 a petition by the Cook Islanders asking for annexation included Niue "if possible".<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> In a document dated 19 October 1900, the "King" and Chiefs of Niue consented to "Queen Victoria taking possession of this island". A despatch to the <a>Secretary of State for the Colonies</a> from the <a>Governor of New Zealand</a> referred to the views expressed by the Chiefs in favour of "annexation" and to this document as "the deed of cession". A British Protectorate was declared, but it remained short-lived. Niue was brought within the boundaries of New Zealand on 11 June 1901 by the same Order and Proclamation as the Cook Islands. The Order limited the islands to which it related by reference to an area in the Pacific described by co-ordinates, and Niue, at 19.02 S., 169.55 W, lies within that area.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>New Zealand Parliament</a> restored self-government in Niue with the 1974 <a>constitution</a>, following <a>a referendum</a> in 1974 in which Niueans had three options: independence, self-government or continuation as a New Zealand territory. The majority selected self-government, and Niue's written constitution<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
was promulgated as supreme law. <a>Robert Rex</a>, ethnically part European, part native, was elected by the <a>Niue Assembly</a> as the first <a>premier</a>, a position he held until his death 18 years later. Rex became the first Niuean to receive a knighthood – in 1984.

</p>
<p>
In January 2004 <a>Cyclone Heta</a> hit Niue, killing two people and causing extensive damage to the entire island, including wiping out most of the south of the capital, Alofi.

</p>
<p>
On March 7, 2020, the <a>International Dark Sky Association</a> announced that Niue had become the first <a>Dark Sky Preserve</a> Nation.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Niue Constitution Act</a> of 1974 vests executive authority in <a>Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand</a> and in the <a>Governor-General of New Zealand</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The Constitution specifies that everyday practice involves the exercise of sovereignty by <a>Cabinet</a>, composed of the <a>Premier</a> (currently <a>Dalton Tagelagi</a> since 11 June 2020) and of three other ministers. The Premier and ministers are members of the <a>Niue Legislative Assembly</a>, the nation's parliament.

</p>
<p>
The Assembly consists of 20 members, 14 of them elected by the electors of each village <a>constituency</a>, and six by all registered voters in all constituencies.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup> Electors must be New Zealand citizens, resident for at least three months, and candidates must be electors and resident for 12 months. Everyone born in Niue must register on the electoral roll.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Niue has no political parties</a>; all Assembly members are <a>independents</a>. The only <a>Niuean political party</a> to have ever existed, the <a>Niue People's Party</a> (1987–2003), <a>won once</a> (in 2002) before disbanding the following year.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Legislative Assembly elects a Speaker as its first official in the first sitting of the Assembly following an election. The speaker calls for nominations for premier; the candidate with the most votes from the 20 members is elected. The premier selects three other members to form a Cabinet, the executive arm of government.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup><a>General elections</a>  take place every three years, most recently on 30 May 2020.

</p>
<p>
The judiciary, independent of the executive and the legislature, includes a <a>High Court</a> and a <a>Court of Appeal</a>, with appeals to the <a>Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> in London.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>

<p>

Niue has operated as a <a>self-governing</a> state in <a>free association</a> with New Zealand since 3 September 1974, when the people endorsed the Constitution in a plebiscite.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> Niue is fully responsible for its internal affairs. Niue's position concerning its external relations is less clear-cut. Section 6 of the <a>Niue Constitution Act</a> provides that: "Nothing in this Act or in the Constitution shall affect the responsibilities of Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand for the external affairs and defence of Niue." Section 8 elaborates but still leaves the position unclear: 
</p>
<p>
Niue has a representative mission (<a>High Commission</a>) in <a>Wellington</a>, New Zealand.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
It is a member of the <a>Pacific Islands Forum</a> and of a number of regional and international agencies. It is not a member of the United Nations, but is a state party to the <a>United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a>, the <a>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</a>, the <a>Ottawa Treaty</a> and the <a>Treaty of Rarotonga</a>. The country became a member state of <a>UNESCO</a> on 26 October 1993.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Traditionally, Niue's foreign relations and defence have been regarded<sup>[<i><a><span>by whom?</span></a></i>]</sup> as the responsibility of New Zealand. However, in recent years Niue has begun to follow its own foreign relations, independent of New Zealand, in some spheres. It established diplomatic relations with the <a>People's Republic of China</a> on 12 December 2007.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> The joint communique signed by Niue and China differs in its treatment of the <a>Taiwan question</a> from that agreed by New Zealand and China. New Zealand "acknowledged" China's position on <a>Taiwan</a> but has never expressly agreed with it, but Niue "recognises that there is only one China in the world, the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the territory of China."<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Niue established diplomatic relations with <a>India</a> on 30 August 2012.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> On 10 June 2014 the Government of Niue announced that Niue had established diplomatic relations with Turkey. The Honourable Minister of Infrastructure <a>Dalton Tagelagi</a> formalised the agreement at the Pacific Small Island States Foreign Ministers meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. The Memorandum of Understanding with Turkey is part of increasing Niue's foreign relationship with countries including the People's Republic of China, India, Australia, Thailand, Samoa, Cook Islands and Singapore.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
People of Niue have fought as part of the New Zealand military. During <a>World War I</a> (1914-1918), Niue sent about 200 soldiers as part of the <a>New Zealand (Māori) Pioneer Battalion</a> in the New Zealand forces.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Niue is not a <a>republic</a>, but for a number of years the ISO list of country names (ISO-<a>3166-1</a>) listed its full name as "the Republic of Niue". In its newsletter of 14 July 2011, the ISO acknowledged that this was a mistake and the words "the Republic of" were deleted from the ISO list of country names.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>

<p>
Niue is a 269 km<sup>2</sup> (104 sq mi) <a>raised coral atoll</a> in the southern Pacific Ocean, east of Tonga.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> There are three outlying <a>coral</a><a>reefs</a>  within the <a>Exclusive Economic Zone</a>, with no land area:

</p>
<p>
Besides these, Albert Meyer Reef, (almost 5 km (3.1 mi) long and wide, least depth 3 m (9.8 ft), 326 km (203 mi) southwest) is not officially claimed by Niue, and the existence of <a>Haymet Rocks</a> (1,273 km (791 mi) east-southeast) is in doubt.

</p>
<p>
Niue is one of the world's largest <a>coral</a> islands. The terrain consists of steep <a>limestone</a> cliffs along the coast with a central <a>plateau</a> rising to about 60 metres (200 ft) above sea level. A <a>coral reef</a> surrounds the island, with the only major break in the reef being in the central western coast, close to the capital, Alofi. A number of limestone <a>caves</a> occur near the coast.

</p>
<p>
The island is roughly oval in shape (with a <a>diameter</a> of about 18 kilometres (11 mi)), with two large bays indenting the western coast, Alofi Bay in the centre and <a>Avatele</a> Bay in the south. Between these is the promontory of Halagigie Point. A small peninsula, TePā Point (Blowhole Point), is close to the settlement of Avatele in the southwest. Most of the population resides close to the west coast, around the capital, and in the northwest.

</p>
<p>
Some of the soils are geochemically very unusual. They are extremely weathered tropical soils, with high levels of iron and aluminium oxides (<a>oxisol</a>) and mercury, and they contain high levels of <a>natural radioactivity</a>. There is almost no <a>uranium</a>, but the radionucleides <a>Th-230</a> and <a>Pa-231</a> head the <a>decay chains</a>. This is the same distribution of elements as found naturally on very deep seabeds, but the geochemical evidence suggests that the origin of these elements is extreme <a>weathering</a> of coral and brief sea submergence <a>120,000 years ago</a>. Endothermal upwelling, by which mild volcanic heat draws deep seawater up through the porous coral, almost certainly contributes.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
No adverse health effects from the radioactivity or the other trace elements have been demonstrated, and calculations show that the level of radioactivity is probably much too low to be detected in the population. These unusual soils are very rich in <a>phosphate</a>, but it is not accessible to plants, being in the very insoluble form of <a>iron phosphate</a>, or crandallite. It is thought that similar radioactive soils may exist on <a>Lifou</a> and <a>Mare</a> near <a>New Caledonia</a>, and <a>Rennell</a> in the <a>Solomon Islands</a>, but no other locations are known.

</p>
<p>
According to the World Health Organization, residents are evidently very susceptible to skin cancer. In 2002 Niue reported skin cancer deaths at a rate of 2,482 per 100,000 people – far higher than any other country.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Niue is separated from New Zealand by the <a>International Date Line</a>. The time difference is 23 hours during the Southern Hemisphere winter and 24 hours when New Zealand uses Daylight Saving Time.

A leader in <a>green growth</a>, Niue is also focusing on solar power provision, with help from the <a>European Union</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup> However, Niue currently deals with one of the highest rates of <a>greenhouse gas production per capita</a> in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> This must be considered however in the context of the small population, and the installed generating capacity of between 833 kW to 1MW. Niue aims to become 80% renewable by 2025.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_49">[49]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup> The <a>Niue Island Organic Farmers Association</a> is currently paving way to a <a>Multilateral Environmental Agreement</a> (MEA) committed to making Niue the world's first fully <a>organic</a> nation by 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In July 2009 a <a>solar panel</a> system was installed, injecting about 50 kW into the Niue national power grid. This is nominally 6% of the average 833 kW electricity production. The solar panels are at <a>Niue High School</a> (20 kW), <a>Niue Power Corporation</a> office, (1.7 kW)<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup> and the <a>Niue Foou Hospital</a> (30 kW). The EU-funded grid-connected <a>photovoltaic systems</a> are supplied under the REP-5 programme and were installed recently by the Niue Power Corporation on the roofs of the high school and the power station office and on ground-mounted support structures in front of the hospital. They will be monitored and maintained by the NPC.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> In 2014 two additional solar power installations were added to the Niue national power grid, one funded under <a>PALM5</a> of Japan is located outside of the Tuila power station – so far only this has battery storage, the other under European Union funding is located opposite the <a>Niue International Airport</a> Terminal.

<p>
Niue is part of the <a>Tongan tropical moist forests</a> terrestrial ecoregion.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup> The island is home to approximately 60 native or pre-European plants, and approximately 160 naturalised flowering plant species.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup> Compared to other Polynesian islands, Niue has sparse documentation for what plants were traditionally found on the island (almost no records are found between the documentation by James Cook's crew in 1774, and <a>Truman G. Yuncker</a>'s botanical survey of the island in 1940).<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <b>Huvalu Forest Conservation Area</b> is a 5,400 ha site on the eastern side of the island. It was established in 1992 and protects the largest area of <a>primary forest</a> in Niue.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> It has been designated an <a>Important Bird Area</a> (IBA) by <a>BirdLife International</a> because it supports populations of <a>crimson-crowned fruit doves</a>, <a>blue-crowned lorikeets</a>, <a>Polynesian trillers</a> and <a>Polynesian starlings</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup>

<p>
Niue's economy is small. Its gross domestic product (GDP) was NZ$17 million in 2003,<sup><a href="#ref_60">[60]</a></sup> or US$10 million at <a>purchasing power parity</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> Niue's GDP has increased to US$24.9 million in 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_62">[62]</a></sup> Niue uses the New Zealand dollar.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Niue Integrated Strategic Plan</a> (NISP) is the national development plan, setting national priorities for development. <a>Cyclone Heta</a> set the island back about two years from its planned timeline to implement the NISP, since national efforts concentrated on recovery efforts. In 2008, Niue had yet to fully recover. After Heta, the government made a major commitment to rehabilitate and develop the private sector.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The government allocated $1 million<sup>[<i><a><span>when?</span></a></i>]</sup> for the private sector, and spent it on helping businesses devastated by the cyclone, and on construction of the Fonuakula Industrial Park. This <a>industrial park</a> is now completed and some businesses are already operating from there. The Fonuakula Industrial Park is managed by the Niue Chamber of Commerce, a not-for-profit organisation providing advisory services to businesses.

</p>
<p>
<b>Joint ventures</b>
</p>
<p>
The government and the Reef Group from New Zealand started two joint ventures in 2003 and 2004 to develop fisheries and a 120-hectare <a>noni</a> juice operation.<sup><a href="#ref_63">[63]</a></sup> Noni fruit comes from <i>Morinda citrifolia</i>, a small tree with edible fruit. Niue Fish Processors Ltd (NFP) is a joint venture company processing fresh fish, mainly tuna (yellowfin, big eye and albacore), for export to overseas markets. NFP operates out of a state-of-the-art fish plant in Amanau Alofi South, completed and opened in October 2004.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>Trade</b>
</p>
<p>
Niue is negotiating <a>free trade agreements</a> with other Pacific countries, <a>PICTA</a> Trade in Services (<a>PICTA TIS</a>), <a>Economic Partnership Agreements</a> with the <a>European Union</a>, and <a>PACERPlus</a> with Australia and New Zealand. The <a>Office of the Chief Trade Adviser</a> (OCTA) has been set up to assist Niue and other Pacific countries in the negotiation of the PACERPlus.

</p>
<p>
<b>Mining</b>
</p>
<p>
In August 2005, an Australian mining company, Yamarna Goldfields, suggested that Niue might have the world's largest deposit of uranium. By early September these hopes were seen as overoptimistic,<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup> and in late October the company cancelled its plans, announcing that exploratory drilling had identified nothing of commercial value.<sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup> The <a>Australian Securities and Investments Commission</a> filed charges in January 2007 against two directors of the company, now called Mining Projects Group Ltd, alleging that their conduct had been deceptive and that they engaged in <a>insider trading</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> This case was settled out of court in July 2008, both sides withdrawing their claims.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Revenue">Revenue</h3>
<p>
<a>Remittances</a> from expatriates were a major source of foreign exchange in the 1970s and early 1980s. Continuous <a>migration</a> to New Zealand has shifted most members of nuclear and <a>extended families</a> there, removing the need to send remittances back home. In the late 1990s, PFTAC conducted studies on the <a>balance of payments</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup> which confirmed that Niueans are receiving few remittances but are sending more money overseas.

</p>
<p>
<b>Foreign aid</b>
</p>
<p>
Foreign aid has been Niue's principal source of income.<sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup> Although most aid comes from New Zealand,<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> this is currently being phased out with reductions of NZ$250,000 each year. The country will need to rely more upon its own economy. The government generates some revenue, mainly from <a>income tax</a>, <a>import tax</a> and the lease of phone lines.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>Offshore banking</b>
</p>
<p>
The government briefly considered offshore banking. Under pressure from the <a>US Treasury</a>, Niue agreed to end its support for schemes designed to minimise tax in countries like New Zealand. Niue provides automated Companies Registration, administered by the <a>New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development</a>. The <a>Niue Legislative Assembly</a> passed the <a>Niue Consumption Tax</a> Act in the first week of February 2009, and the 12.5% tax on goods and services was expected to take effect on 1 April 2009. Income tax has been lowered, and import tax may be reset to zero except for "sin" items like tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks. Tax on secondary income has been lowered from 35% to 10%, with the stated goal of fostering increased labour productivity.<sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<b>Internet</b>
</p>
<p>
In 1997, the <a>Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a> (IANA), under contract with the US Department of Commerce, assigned the Internet Users Society-Niue (IUS-N), a private nonprofit, as manager of the <a>.nu</a><a>top-level domain</a>  on the Internet. IUS-N's charitable purpose was – and continues to be – to use revenue from the registration of .nu domain names to fund low-cost or free Internet services for the people of Niue. In a letter to <a>ICANN</a> in 2007, IUS-N's independent auditors reported IUS-N had invested US$3 million for Internet services in Niue between 1999 and 2005 from .nu domain name registration revenue during that period. In 1999, IUS-N and the Government of Niue signed an agreement whereby the Government recognised that IUS-N managed the .nu ccTLD under IANA's authority and IUS-N committed to provide free Internet services to government departments as well as to Niue's private citizens. A newly elected government later disputed that agreement and attempted to assert a claim on the domain name, including a requirement for IUS-N to make direct payments of compensation to the government.<sup><a href="#ref_71">[71]</a></sup> In 2005, a Government-appointed Commission of Inquiry into the dispute released its report, which found no merit in the government's claims; the government subsequently dismissed the claims in 2007.<sup><a href="#ref_72">[72]</a></sup> Starting in 2003, IUS-N began installing <a>Wi-Fi</a> connections throughout the capital village of <a>Alofi</a> and in several nearby villages and schools, and has been expanding Wi-Fi coverage into the outer villages since then, making Niue the first Wi-Fi nation.<sup><a href="#ref_73">[73]</a></sup> To assure security for government departments, IUS-N provides the government with a secure DSL connection to IUS-N's satellite Internet link, at no cost.

</p>
<p>
On Dec 16, 2020, the Government of Niue commenced an action to "redelegate" its national webspace, .nu, from the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the supranational non-profit that coordinates top-level domains to ensure the stable operation of the internet in order to assign control of the .nu domain to the Government of Niue.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Agriculture">Agriculture</h3>
<p>
Agriculture is very important to the lifestyle of Niueans and the economy, and around 204 square kilometres of the land area are available for agriculture.<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup><a>Subsistence agriculture</a>  is very much part of Niue's culture, where nearly all the households have plantations of <a>taro</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> Taro is a <a>staple food</a>, and the pink taro now dominant in the taro markets in New Zealand and Australia is an intellectual property of Niue. This is one of the naturally occurring taro varieties on Niue, and has a strong resistance to pests. The Niue <a>taro</a> is known in Samoa as "talo Niue" and in international markets as pink taro. Niue exports taro to New Zealand.
<a>Tapioca</a> or cassava, <a>yams</a> and <a>kumara</a> also grow very well,<sup><a href="#ref_61">[61]</a></sup> as do different varieties of bananas. <a>Coconut meat</a>, <a>passionfruit</a> and <a>limes</a> dominated exports in the 1970s, but in 2008 <a>vanilla</a>, <a>noni</a> and taro were the main export crops.

</p>
<p>
Most families grow their own food crops for subsistence and sell their surplus at the Niue Makete in Alofi, or export to their families in New Zealand.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup><a>Coconut crab</a>
, or uga, is also part of the <a>food chain</a>; it lives in the forest and coastal areas.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 2003, the government made a commitment to develop and expand <a>vanilla</a> production with the support of <a>NZAID</a>. Vanilla has grown wild on Niue for a long time. Despite the setback caused by the devastating <a>Cyclone Heta</a> in early 2004, work on vanilla production continues. The expansion plan started with the employment of the unemployed or underemployed <a>labour force</a> to help clear land, plant supporting trees and plant vanilla vines. The approach to accessing land includes planning to have each household plant a small plot of around half to 1-acre (0.40 ha) to be cleared and planted with vanilla vines. There are a lot of planting materials for supporting trees to meet demand for the expansion of vanilla plantations, but a severe shortage of vanilla vines for planting stock. There are the existing vanilla vines, but cutting them for planting stock will reduce or stop the vanilla from producing beans. At the moment, the focus is in the areas of harvesting and marketing.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
Tourism is one of the three priority <a>economic sectors</a> (the other two are fisheries and agriculture) for economic development. In 2006, estimated visitor expenditure reached <span>US$1.6 million</span> (equivalent to about $2M in 2020) making tourism a major industry for Niue. Niue will continue to receive direct support from the government and overseas donor agencies. The only airport is <a>Niue International Airport</a>. <a>Air New Zealand</a> is the sole airline, flying twice a week from <a>Auckland</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> In the early 1990s Niue International Airport was served by a local airline, <a>Niue Airlines</a>, but it closed in 1992.

</p>
<p>
There is a tourism development strategy to increase the number of rooms available to tourists at a sustainable level. Niue is trying to attract foreign investors to invest in the tourism industry by offering import and company tax concessions as incentives. New Zealand businessman <a>Earl Hagaman</a>, founder of Scenic Hotel Group, was awarded a contract in 2014 to manage the Matavai Resort in Niue after he made a $101,000 political donation to the <a>New Zealand National Party</a>, which at that time led a minority government in New Zealand. The resort is subsidized by New Zealand, which wants to bolster tourism there. In 2015 New Zealand announced $7.5m in additional funding for expansion of the resort. The selection of the Matavai contractor was made by the Niue Tourism Property Trust, whose trustees are appointed by New Zealand Foreign Affairs minister <a>Murray McCully</a>. Prime Minister <a>John Key</a> said he did not handle campaign donations, and that Niue premier <a>Toke Talagi</a> has long pursued tourism as a growth strategy. McCully denied any link between the donation, the foreign aid and the contractor selection.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Niue became the world's first <a>dark sky country</a> in March <a>2020</a>. The entire island maintains standards of light development and keeps light pollution limited. Visitors will be able to enjoy guided Astro-tours led by trained Niuean community members. Viewing sites which are used for whale-watching and accessing the sea, as well as the roads that cross the island, make ideal viewing locations.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The sailing season begins in May. Alofi Bay has many mooring buoys and yacht crews can lodge at Niue Backpackers.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup> The anchorage in Niue is one of the least protected in the South Pacific, so much that cruise ship tenders are often unable to risk landing passengers due to weather or sea conditions, as well as the associated risk of having them stranded ashore.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Other challenges of the anchorage are a primarily coral bottom and many deep spots.<sup><a href="#ref_83">[83]</a></sup> Mooring buoys are attached to seine floats that support the mooring lines away from seabed obstructions.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Debt">Debt</h3>
<p>
On 27 October 2016, Niue officially declared that all its <a>national debt</a> was paid off.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup> The government plans to spend money saved from servicing loans on increasing pensions and offering incentives to lure expatriates back home. However, Niue is not entirely independent. New Zealand pays $14 million in aid each year and Niue still depends on New Zealand economically. Premier Toke Talagi said Niue managed to pay off US$4 million of debt and had "no interest" in borrowing again, particularly from huge powers such as China.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>

The first computers were <a>Apple</a> machines brought in by the <a>University of the South Pacific</a> Extension Centre around the early 1980s. The Treasury Department computerised its general ledger in 1986 using <a>NEC</a> personal computers that were <a>IBM PC XT</a> compatible.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> The Census of Households and Population in 1986 was the first to be processed using a personal computer with the assistance of <a>David Marshall</a>, FAO Adviser on Agricultural Statistics, advising <a>UNFPA</a> Demographer Dr Lawrence Lewis and Niue Government Statistician <a>Bill Vakaafi Motufoou</a> to switch from using manual tabulation cards. In 1987 Statistics Niue got its new personal computer NEC PC AT use for processing the 1986 census data; personnel were sent on training in Japan and New Zealand to use the new computer. The first Computer Policy was developed and adopted in 1988.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

In 2003, Niue became the first country in the world to provide state-funded <a>wireless internet</a> to all inhabitants.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup>

In August 2008 it has been reported that all school students have what is known as the <a>OLPC XO-1</a>, a specialised laptop by the <a>One Laptop per Child</a> project designed for children in the developing world.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> Niue was also a location of tests for the <a>OpenBTS</a> project, which aims to deliver low-cost <a>GSM</a><a>base stations</a>  built with <a>open source software</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>
In July 2011, Telecom Niue launched pre-paid mobile services (Voice/EDGE – 2.5G) as Rokcell Mobile based on the commercial GSM product of vendor Lemko. Three BTS sites will cover the nation. International roaming is not currently available. The fibre optic cable ring is now completed around the island (FTTC), Internet/ADSL services were rolled out towards the end of 2011.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
In January 2015 Telecom Niue completed the laying of the fibre optic cable around Niue connecting all the 14 villages, making land line phones and ADSL internet connection available to households.
