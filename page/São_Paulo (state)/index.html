<p>
<b>São Paulo</b> (<span>Portuguese pronunciation: </span><span><a>[sɐ̃w ˈpawlu]</a></span><span>(<span><span><span><a><img></img></a></span><a>listen</a></span></span>)</span> ) is one of the <a>26 states</a> of the <a>Federative Republic of Brazil</a> and is named after <a>Saint Paul of Tarsus</a>. A major industrial complex, the state has 21.9% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for 33.9%<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> of Brazil's <a>GDP</a>. São Paulo also has the <a>second-highest</a><a>Human Development Index</a>  (HDI) and <a>GDP per capita</a>, the <a>fourth-lowest infant mortality rate</a>, the <a>third-highest life expectancy</a>, and the <a>third-lowest rate of illiteracy</a> among the federative units of Brazil. São Paulo alone is wealthier than <a>Argentina</a>, <a>Uruguay</a>, <a>Paraguay</a>, and <a>Bolivia</a> combined.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> São Paulo is also the world's twenty-eighth-most populous <a>sub-national entity</a> and the most populous sub-national entity in <a>the Americas</a>.

</p>
<p>
With more than 46 million inhabitants in 2019, São Paulo is the <a>most populous</a> Brazilian state, the most populous national subdivision in the Americas,<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> and the third most populous political unit of South America, surpassed only by the rest of the Brazilian Federation and <a>Colombia</a>. The local population is one of the most diverse in the country and descended mostly from <a>Italians</a>, who began immigrating to the country in the late 19th century;<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> of the <a>Portuguese</a>, who colonized Brazil and installed the first European settlements in the region; <a>indigenous peoples</a>, many distinct <a>ethnic groups</a>; <a>Africans</a>, who were brought from <a>Africa</a> as slaves in the <a>colonial era</a> and migrants from other regions of the country. In addition, <a>Arabs</a>, <a>Germans</a>, <a>Spanish</a>, <a>Japanese</a>, <a>Chinese</a>, and <a>Greeks</a> also are present in the ethnic composition of the local population.

</p>
<p>
The area that today corresponds to the state territory was already inhabited by <a>indigenous peoples</a> from approximately 12,000 BC. In the early 16th century, the coast of the region was visited by <a>Portuguese</a> and <a>Spanish</a> explorers and navigators. In 1532 <a>Martim Afonso de Sousa</a> would establish the first <a>Portuguese</a> permanent settlement in the <a>Americas</a><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>—the village of <a>São Vicente</a>, in the <a>Baixada Santista</a>. In the 17th century, the paulistas <i><a>bandeirantes</a></i> intensified the exploration of the colony's interior, which eventually expanded the territorial domain of <a>Portugal</a> and the <a>Portuguese Empire</a> in <a>South America</a>. In the 18th century, after the establishment of the Province of São Paulo, the region began to gain political weight. After <a>independence</a> in 1820, São Paulo began to become a major agricultural producer (mainly <a>coffee</a>) in the newly constituted <a>Empire of Brazil</a>, which ultimately created a rich regional rural <a>oligarchy</a>, which would switch on the command of the Brazilian government with <a>Minas Gerais</a>'s elites during the <a>early republican period</a> in the 1880s. Under the <a>Vargas Era</a>, the state was one of the first to initiate a process of <a>industrialization</a> and its population became one of the most <a>urban</a> of the federation.

</p>
<p>
The city of <a>São Paulo</a>, the homonymous state capital, is ranked as the <a>world's 12th largest city</a> and <a>its metropolitan area</a>, with 20 million inhabitants,<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> is the <a>9th largest in the world</a> and first in the <a>Americas</a>. Regions near the city of São Paulo are also metropolitan areas, such as <a>Campinas</a>, <a>Santos</a>, <a>Sorocaba</a> and <a>São José dos Campos</a>. The total population of these areas coupled with the state capital—the so-called "<a>Expanded Metropolitan Complex of São Paulo</a>"—exceeds 30 million inhabitants, i.e. approximately 75 percent of the population of São Paulo statewide, the first macro-metropolis in the southern hemisphere, joining 65 municipalities that together are home to 12 percent of the Brazilian population.

<h3 id="Early_period">Early period</h3>
<p>
In pre-European times, the area that is now São Paulo state was occupied by the <a>Tupi people</a>'s nation, who subsisted through hunting and cultivation. The first European to settle in the area was <a>João Ramalho</a>, a <a>Portuguese</a> sailor who may have been shipwrecked around 1510, ten years after the first Portuguese landfall in Brazil. He married the daughter of a local chieftain and became a settler. In 1532, the first colonial expedition, led by <a>Martim Afonso de Sousa</a> of Portugal, landed at <a>São Vicente</a> (near the present-day port at <a>Santos</a>). De Sousa added Ramalho's settlement to his colony.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Benedito_Calixto_de_Jesus_-_Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_S%C3%A3o_Vicente%2C_Acervo_do_Museu_Paulista_da_USP.jpg/310px-Benedito_Calixto_de_Jesus_-_Funda%C3%A7%C3%A3o_de_S%C3%A3o_Vicente%2C_Acervo_do_Museu_Paulista_da_USP.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Early European colonization of Brazil was very limited. Portugal was more interested in Africa and Asia. But with <a>English</a> and <a>French</a> raiding <a>privateer</a> ships just off the coast, the territory had to be protected. Unwilling to shoulder the naval defense burden himself, the Portuguese ruler, King <a>Joao III</a>, divided the coast into "captaincies", or swathes of land, 50 leagues apart. He distributed them among well-connected Portuguese, hoping that each would be self-reliant. The early port and sugar-cultivating settlement of São Vicente was one rare success connected to this policy. In 1548, João III brought Brazil under direct royal control.

</p>
<p>
Fearing <a>Indian</a> attack, he discouraged development of the territory's vast interior. Some whites headed nonetheless for <a>Piratininga</a>, a plateau near São Vicente, drawn by its navigable rivers and agricultural potential. Borda do Campo, the plateau settlement, became an official town (Santo André da Borda do Campo) in 1553. The history of São Paulo city proper begins with the founding of a <a>Jesuit</a> mission of the <a>Roman Catholic</a> order of clergy on January 25, 1554—the anniversary of <a>Saint Paul</a>'s conversion. The station, which is at the heart of the current city, was named <a>São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga</a> (or just Pateo do Colégio). In 1560, the threat of Indian attack led many to flee from the exposed <a>Santo André da Borda do Campo</a> to the walled fortified Colegio. Two years later, the Colégio was besieged. Though the town survived, fighting took place sporadically for another three decades.

</p>
<p>
By 1600, the town had about 1,500 citizens and 150 households. Little was produced for export, save a number of agricultural goods. The isolation was to continue for many years, as the development of Brazil centered on the sugar plantations in the north-east.

</p>
<p>
The city's location, at the mouth of the <a>Tietê-Paranapanema</a> river system (which winds into the interior), made it an ideal base for another activity—<a>enslaving</a> expeditions. The economics were simple. Enslaved manpower for Brazil's northern sugar plantations were in short supply. Enslaved Africans were expensive, so demand for indigenous captives soared. The task was, nonetheless, hard, if not impossible, to achieve.

</p>

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Raposo_Tavares.jpg/170px-Raposo_Tavares.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Among those who attempted to enslave the native were explorers of the hinterland called "<i><a>bandeirantes</a></i>". From their base in São Paulo, they also combed the interior in search of natural riches. <a>Silver</a>, <a>gold</a> and <a>diamonds</a> were companion pursuits, as well as the exploration of unknown territories. <a>Roman Catholic</a> missionaries sometimes tagged along, as efforts at converting the natives aborigines (Indians) worked hand in hand with Portuguese colonialism.

</p>
<p>
Despite their atrocities, the wild and hardy bandeirantes are now equally remembered for penetrating Brazil's vast interior. Trading posts established by them became permanent settlements. Interior routes opened up. Though the <i>bandeirantes</i> had no loyalty to the <a>Portuguese crown</a>, they did claim land for the king. Thus, the borders of Brazil were pushed forward to the northwest and the <a>Amazon</a> region and west to the <a>Andes Mountains</a>.

</p>
<p>
French Emperor <a>Napoleon's invasion of Portugal</a> in 1807 prompted the <a>British</a> with their vast powerful  <a>Royal Navy</a> to evacuate King <a>João VI of Portugal</a>, Portugal's prince regent, from the capital <a>Lisbon</a>, across the <a>Atlantic</a> to <a>Rio de Janeiro</a> and Brazil then became the first overseas colony to become the temporary headquarters of the <a>Portuguese Empire</a>. João VI rewarded his hosts with economic reforms that would prove crucial to São Paulo's rise. Brazil's ports—long closed to non-Portuguese ships—were opened up to international trade. Restrictions on domestic manufacturing were waived.

</p>
<p>
When Napoleon was defeated in 1815, with the end of the <a>Napoleonic Wars</a>, João gave political shape to his territory, which soon became the <a>United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves</a>. Portugal and Brazil, in other words, were ostensibly co-equals. Returning to Portugal six years later, João left his son, <a>Pedro</a>, to rule as regent and governor.

<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Marc_Ferrez_-_IMS_002001MF005003.jpg/220px-Marc_Ferrez_-_IMS_002001MF005003.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
<a>Pedro</a> inherited his father's love of Brazil, resisting demands from <a>Lisbon</a> that Brazil should be ruled from Europe once again. Legend has it that in 1822 the regent was riding outside São Paulo when a messenger delivered a missive demanding his return to Europe, and Dom Pedro waved his sword and shouted "Independência ou morte!" (Independence or death).

</p>
<p>
<a>João</a> had whetted the appetite of <a>Brazilians</a>, who now sought a full break from the monarchy. The ever-restless <a>Paulistas</a> were at the vanguard of the independence movement. The small mother country of Portugal was in no position to resist—on September 7, 1822, Dom Pedro rubber-stamped Brazil's independence. He was crowned emperor shortly afterwards. The emperors ruled an independent Brazil until 1889. Over this time, the growth of liberalism in Europe had a parallel in Brazil. As the <a>Brazilian provinces</a> became more assertive, São Paulo was the scene of a minor (and unsuccessful) liberal revolution in 1842. When independence was declared, the city of São Paulo had just 25,000 people and 4,000 houses, but the next 60 years would see gradual growth. In 1828, the <a>Law School</a>, the pioneer of the city's intellectual tradition, opened. The first newspaper, <i>O Farol Paulistano</i>, appeared in 1827. Municipal developments such as <a>botanical gardens</a>, an <a>opera house</a> and a <a>library</a>, gave the city a cultural boost.

</p>
<p>
Regardless, São Paulo still faced many hurdles, especially <a>transport</a>. Mule-trains were the main method of transportation, and the road from the plateau down to the port of Santos was famously arduous. In the late 1860s São Paulo got its first <a>railway</a> line, developed by British engineers, to the <a>Port of Santos</a>. Other lines, such as a railway to Campinas, were soon built. This was good timing, because in the 1880s the coffee craze hit in earnest. Brazil, which had been growing it since the mid-18th century, could grow more. The <a>Paraíba valley</a>, which spans the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, had suitable <a>soil</a> and <a>climate</a>. São Paulo city, at the western end of the Paraíba valley, was well positioned to channel the coffee to the port of Santos.

</p>
<h3 id="Republican_era">Republican era</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/06/Bolsa_do_Caf%C3%A9_de_Santos-_Seus_vitrais.JPG/220px-Bolsa_do_Caf%C3%A9_de_Santos-_Seus_vitrais.JPG" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Brazilian monarchy had fallen in 1889. A feudalistic regime, the new republic had friends only among the sugar planters of the <a>Northeast</a>, whose dominance Paulistanos, among others, despised. In 1891, a new federal constitution, which delegated power to the states, was approved. The new coffee elite saw its chance. São Paulo ironed out a power-sharing understanding—known as the "café com leite" (<a>coffee</a>-and-<a>milk</a>) deal—with dairy-rich <a>Minas Gerais</a>, Brazil's other dominant state. Together, they held a virtual lock on federal power. Brazilian politics now became a favourite pastime of the once-rebellious Paulistanos, who sent several presidents to <a>Rio de Janeiro</a>—including <a>Prudente de Morais</a>, Brazil's first civilian president, who took office in 1894.

</p>
<p>
Plantation labor was needed—this time for coffee, not sugar. <a>Slavery</a> had been fading since the import of enslaved Africans was outlawed in 1850. São Paulo, thanks to such figures as <a>Luiz Gama</a> (a former slave), was a center of abolitionism. In 1888, <a>Brazil abolished slavery</a> (it was the last country in the <a>Americas</a> to do so) and the freed <a>African-Brazilians</a> who had been helping build the nation were then forced to beg for their jobs back, working for food and shelter only because of the failure of the system to integrate them as equal citizens with <a>Euro-Brazilians</a>. In an effort to "bleach the race", as the nation's leaders feared Brazil was becoming a "black country", <a>Spanish</a>, <a>Portuguese</a> and <a>Italian</a> nationals were given incentives to become farm workers in São Paulo. The state government was so eager to bring in European immigrants that it paid for their trips and provided varying levels of subsidy.

</p>
<p>
By 1893, foreigners made up over 55 percent of São Paulo's population. Fearing oversupply, the government applied the brakes briefly in 1899; then the boom resumed. From 1908, the <a>Japanese</a> arrived in great numbers, many destined for the plantations on fixed-term contracts. By 1920, São Paulo was Brazil's second-largest city; a half-century before, it had been just the tenth-largest. Immigration and migration of Paulistas from other towns as well as Nordestinos and citizens from other states, the coffee industry, and modernization through the manufacturing of textiles, car and airplane parts, as well as food and technological industries, construction, fashion, and services transformed the greater São Paulo area into a thriving <a>megalopolis</a> and one of the world's greatest <a>multiethnic</a> regions.

</p>
<h3 id="Early_20th%20century">Early 20th century</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Imigrantes.jpg/220px-Imigrantes.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
Between 1901 and 1910, coffee made up 51 percent of Brazil's total exports, far overshadowing rubber, sugar and cotton. But reliance on coffee made Brazil (and São Paulo in particular) vulnerable to poor harvests and the whims of world markets. The development of plantations in the 1890s, and widespread reliance on credit, took place against fluctuating prices and supply levels, culminating in saturation of the international market around the start of the 20th century. The government's policies of "<a>valorisation</a> "—borrowing money to buy coffee and stockpiling it, in order to have a surplus during bad harvests, and meanwhile taxing coffee exports to pay off loans—seemed feasible in the short term (as did its manipulation of foreign-exchange rates to the advantage of coffee growers). But in the longer term, these actions contributed to oversupply and eventual collapse.

</p>
<p>
São Paulo's industrial development, from 1889 into the 1940s, was gradual and inward looking. Initially, industry was closely associated with agriculture: cotton plantations led to the growth of <a>textile manufacturing</a>. Coffee planters were among the early industrial investors.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Immigration_arabe_%3B_carte_couverture_-_1908.jpg/170px-Immigration_arabe_%3B_carte_couverture_-_1908.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The boom in <a>immigration</a> provided a market for goods, and sectors such as food processing grew. Traditional <a>immigrant</a> families such as the <a>Matarazzo</a>, <a>Diniz</a>, Mofarrej and <a>Maluf</a> became industrialists, entrepreneurs, and leading politicians.

</p>
<p>
Restrictions on imports forced by world wars and government policies of "import substitution" and trade tariffs, all contributed to industrial growth. By 1945, São Paulo had become the largest industrial center in South America. World War I sent ripples through Brazil. Inflation was rampant. Some 50,000 workers went on strike.

</p>
<p>
The growing of the <a>urban population</a> grew increasingly resentful of the coffee elite. Disaffected intellectuals expressed their views during a memorable "Week of Modern Art" in 1922. Two years later, a garrison of <a>soldiers</a> staged a revolt (eventually quashed by government troops).

</p>
<p>
The stand-off was also political: politics had been long monopolised by the Paulista Republican Party, but in 1926 a more left-leaning party rose in opposition. In 1928, the PRP amended São Paulo's state constitution to give it more control over the city. The turbulence was mirrored on Brazil's national scene. With the <a>Great Depression</a>, coffee prices plunged, as did real <a>GDP</a>. Americans, keen investors during the 1920s, backed away.

</p>
<p>
The opening of the first highway between São Paulo and Rio in 1928 was one of the few bright spots. Into the breach stepped <a>Getúlio Vargas</a>, a southerner veteran in state politics. In Brazil's <a>1930 presidential elections</a>, he opposed <a>Júlio Prestes</a>, a favorite son of São Paulo. Vargas lost the election, but with backing from Minas Gerais state—São Paulo's former ally and neighbor to the north—he seized power regardless.

</p>
<h3 id="Paulista_War">Paulista War</h3>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionalist_Revolution">Constitutionalist Revolution</a></div>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Cartaz_Revolucion%C3%A1rio.jpg/170px-Cartaz_Revolucion%C3%A1rio.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The <a>Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932</a> or Paulista War is the name given to the uprising of the population of the Brazilian state of São Paulo against the federal government of Vargas.  Its main goal was to press the provisional government headed by Getúlio Vargas to enact a new Constitution, since it had revoked the previous one, adopted in 1889. However, as the movement developed and resentment against President Vargas grew deeper, it came to advocate the overthrow of the Federal Government and the secession of São Paulo from the Brazilian federation. But, it is noted that the separatist scenario was used as guerrilla tactics by the Federal Government to turn the population of the rest of the country against the state of São Paulo, broadcasting the alleged separatist notion throughout the country. There is no evidence that the movement's commanders sought separatism.

</p>
<p>
The uprising started on July 9, 1932, after five protesting students were killed by government troops on May 23, 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called <a>MMDC</a> (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.

</p>
<p>
Revolutionary troops entrenched in the battlefield. In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of three other powerful states, (Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro), the politicians of São Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the São Paulo civil war was won by the Federation on October 2, 1932.

</p>
<p>
In spite of its military defeat, some of the movement's main demands were finally granted by Vargas afterwards: the appointment of a non-military state Governor, the election of a Constituent Assembly and, finally, the enactment of a new Constitution in 1934. However that Constitution was short lived, as in 1937, amidst growing extremism on the left and right wings of the political spectrum, Vargas closed the National Congress and enacted another Constitution, which established an authoritarian regime called Estado Novo.

</p>
<h3 id="Late_20th%20century">Late 20th century</h3>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Edif%C3%ADcio_do_Banespa.jpg/170px-Edif%C3%ADcio_do_Banespa.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
<a>Vargas</a>'s rule was a study in political turbulence. Elected in 1934, he ruled by dictatorship (albeit a popular one, thanks to his health and social-welfare programmes) from 1937 to 1945—a period dubbed the "<a>Estado Novo</a>". Thrown out by a coup in 1945, he ran for office again in 1950, and was overwhelmingly elected. On the verge of being overthrown from office again, he committed suicide in 1954. Vargas's main legacy was the centralization of power.

</p>
<p>
The encouragement of industry and diversification of agriculture, not to mention the abolition of subsidies on coffee, finally did away with the dominance of the coffee oligarchies. His replacement, <a>Juscelino Kubitschek</a>, focused on heavy industry. Kubitschek built car factories, steel plants, hydro-power infrastructure and roads. <a>Petrobras</a>, Brazil's oil monolith, was set up in 1953. By 1958, São Paulo state controlled some 55 percent of Brazil's industrial production, up from 17 percent in 1907. Another of Kubitschek's pet projects was the creation of <a>Brasília</a>, which became Brazil's capital in 1960—the year <a>Kubitschek</a> stepped down. The <a>University of São Paulo</a> was founded in 1934; two years after São Paulo's failed uprising. It has established itself as the most prestigious higher learning institution in the country.

</p>
<p>
With a transitional government from military to civil and a new currency that made stagnant the economy during the mid- to late 1980s, unemployment and crime became rampant. São Paulo, by now the world's third-largest city after <a>Mexico City</a> and <a>Tokyo</a>, was hard-hit. Wealthy Brazilians retreated to suburban highly secured housing complexes such as <a>Alphaville</a>, and <i><a>favelas</a></i>, pockets of substandard living slums that lined the periphery, had a tremendous growth. For the first time in history, Brazil experienced large segments of its population immigrating to continents such as <a>North America</a>, <a>Europe</a>, <a>Australia</a>, and <a>East Asia</a>, particularly to <a>Japan</a>.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>

<p>
São Paulo is one of 27 <a>states of Brazil</a>, located southwest of the <a>Southeast Region</a>. The state area is 248,222.362 km<sup>2</sup> (95,839.190 sq mi), most of the north of the <a>Tropic of Capricorn</a>, and the 12th unit of the Brazilian federation in area and the second in the Southeast region, behind only Minas Gerais. The state has a relatively high relief, having 85 percent of its surface between three hundred and nine hundred meters above <a>sea level</a>, 8 percent below three hundred meters and 7 percent over nine hundred meters.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The distance between its north and south end points is 611 km (380 mi), and 923 km (574 mi) between the east–west extremes. The state time zone follows the <a>Brasilia time</a>, which is three hours late in relation to the <a>Greenwich Meridian</a>. It is limited to the states of <a>Minas Gerais</a> to the north and northeast, the <a>Paraná</a> to the south, <a>Rio de Janeiro</a> to the east, <a>Mato Grosso do Sul</a> to the west, and the <a>Atlantic Ocean</a> to the southeast.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>

The coastline consists of plains below 300 metres (980 ft), that border the <a>Serra do Mar</a>. Located in the <a>Serra da Mantiqueira</a>, Mine Stone, with 2,798 metres (9,180 ft) above sea level, is the highest point the state territory and the fifth in the country.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>

São Paulo has its territory divided into 21 <a>watersheds</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup> inserted in three <a>river basin</a> districts, the largest of which is the <a>Paraná</a>, which covers much of the state territory. Noteworthy is the <a>Rio Grande</a>, which born in <a>Minas Gerais</a> and join with <a>Paranaiba</a> to form the <a>Parana River</a>, which separates São Paulo from <a>Mato Grosso do Sul</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>

<p>
Two major rivers Paulistas tributaries of the left bank of the Paraná River are the <a>Paranapanema</a>, which is 930 km (580 mi) long and a natural divider between São Paulo and <a>Paraná</a> in most of its course,<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> and the <a>Tiete River</a>, which has a length of 1,136 km (706 mi) and runs through the state territory from southeast to northwest, from its source in <a>Salesópolis</a>, to its mouth in the city of <a>Itapura</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>

<p>
The state territory covers seven distinct climatic types, taking into account the temperature and rainfall. In the mountain areas of the state, there are <a>subtropical climate</a> (<i>Cfa</i> in <a>Köppen climate classification</a>), in areas of high altitude such as the <a>Serra do Mar</a> e <a>Serra da Mantiqueira</a>, having humid, hot summers and average temperatures below 18 °C (64 °F) in the month cooler year; and <a>oceanic</a> (<i>Cfb</i> and <i>Cwb</i>) with regular and well distributed throughout the year and warmer summers rains.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
On the coast, the climate is super-humid tropical type, very similar to the prevailing <a>equatorial climate</a> in the <a>Amazon</a> (<i>Af</i>), with rainfall exceeding sixty monthly millimeters in every month of the year, without the existence of a dry season. The tropical climate of altitude (<i>Cwa</i>), predominant in the state territory, specifically in the center of the state, is characterized by a summer rainy season and a dry season in winter, with temperatures above 22 °C (72 °F) in the hottest month of the year. In other areas, there is <a>tropical savanna climate</a> (<i>Aw</i>) with rainfall less than 60 millimetres (2.4 in) in one or more months of the year and warmer, with average temperatures above 18 °C (64 °F) during the year. There are also small areas with characteristics of <a>monsoons</a> (<i>Am</i>).<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>

According to the <a>IBGE</a> estimates for 2014, there were 44,035,304 people residing in the state. The population density was 177.4 inhabitants per square kilometre (459/sq mi). The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) research revealed the following numbers: 27,612,000 <a>White</a> people (63.1%), 12,842,000 <a>Brown</a> (<a>Multiracial</a>) people (29.3%), 2,810,000 <a>Black</a> people (6.4%), 451,000 <a>Asian</a> people (1%), and 54,000 <a>Amerindian</a> people (0.1%).<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>

People of <a>Italian</a> descent predominate in many towns, including the capital city, where 65 percent of the population has at least one Italian ancestor. The Italians mostly came from <a>Veneto</a> and <a>Campania</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Portuguese</a> and <a>Spanish</a> descendants predominate in most towns. Most of the Portuguese immigrants and settlers came from the <a>Entre-Douro-e-Minho Province</a> in northern Portugal, the Spanish immigrants mostly came from <a>Galicia</a> and <a>Andalusia</a>.

<p>
People of more than 70 different nationalities emigrated to Brazil in the past centuries, most of them through the <a>Port of Santos</a> in <a>Santos, São Paulo</a>. Although many of them spread to other areas of Brazil, São Paulo can be considered a true melting-pot. People of <a>German</a>, <a>Hungarian</a>, <a>Lithuanian</a>, <a>Russian</a>, <a>Chinese</a>, <a>Korean</a>, <a>Polish</a>, <a>American</a>, <a>Bolivian</a>, <a>Greek</a> and <a>French</a> background, as well as dozens of other immigrant groups, form sizable groups in the state.

<p>
A genetic study, from 2013, showed the overall composition of São Paulo to be: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American, respectively.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>

The <a>Brazilian Social Democracy Party</a> (PSDB) has formed the government of the state since 1994, and was re-elected in 2018 for four more years. The current governor is <a>João Doria</a> (2019–2023).<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

Local politicians of note (with party affiliations) include: former <a>President of Brazil</a> (1994–2002) <a>Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a> (PSDB), former president (2002–2010) <a>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> (<a>PT</a>), <a>José Serra</a> (PSDB), <a>Geraldo Alckmin</a> (PSDB), <a>Mário Covas</a> (PSDB), <a>Antonio Palocci</a> (PT), <a>Eduardo Suplicy</a> (PT), <a>Aloízio Mercadante</a> (PT), <a>Marta Suplicy</a> (MDB), <a>Gilberto Kassab</a> (<a>PSD</a>), and <a>Paulo Maluf</a> (<a>PP</a>). Maluf is a controversial figure in São Paulo City politics, and is frequently accused of corruption. However, many voters used to support him because of his achievements during his governments, which the most well-known was the <a>São Paulo subway</a> system (the first in Brazil) and the João Goulart expressway, also known as <a>Minhocão</a>. Maluf has, however, failed to be elected in the last elections for governor of the state and for mayor of the state capital.

Three of last four Brazilian presidents, <a>Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a> (PSDB), <a>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</a> (PT) and <a>Michel Temer</a> (MDB), were politicians from São Paulo, although Cardoso was actually born in the state of <a>Rio de Janeiro</a>, and Lula in <a>Pernambuco</a>. Cardoso and Lula respectively live in the cities of São Paulo and <a>São Bernardo do Campo</a>. The current president, <a>Jair Bolsonaro</a> (PSL), was born in small town of <a>Glicério</a>, in the state northwest, but built his political career in the <a>state of Rio de Janeiro</a>.

According to the Strategist De Leon Petta, São Paulo state is geopolitically responsible to split Brazil in two parts, the federal integrated area and the south non-integrated area. Because of its strong self-determination, São Paulo functions as a backup to the rest of Brazil and as a historical pioneer, creating innovations for the rest of the country to sustain its own demands and needs. If it is a fact that on one side São Paulo functions as a geopolitical buffer, blocking the South from a stronger national cohesion, then the other side is also true—a failed São Paulo would probably wreck all of Brazil. At the same time that São Paulo is an anchor whose administration hinders presidential and federal authority, the state of São Paulo also prevents reckless rulers from freely taking complete control of the country and establishing an excessively centralized government. If by one side this is the reason of the south area has feelings for separation by the other side this prevented major economic and political crisis to spread in the same level across the country.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup>

<p>
In Brazil, the <a>automotive</a> sector represents about 22% of industrial GDP. <a>ABC Paulista</a> is the first center and largest automobile center in Brazil. When the country's manufacturing was practically restricted to ABC, the State represented 74.8% of Brazilian production in 1990. In 2017, this index decreased to 46.6%, and in 2019, to 40.1%, due to a phenomenon of internalization of vehicle production in Brazil, driven by factors such as unions, which made payroll and labor burdens excessively burdensome, discouraged investment, and favored the search for new cities. The development of ABC cities has also helped curb the appeal, due to rising real estate costs and a higher density of residential areas. São Paulo has factories of <a>GM</a>, <a>Volkswagen</a>, <a>Ford</a>, <a>Honda</a>, <a>Toyota</a>, <a>Hyundai</a>, <a>Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a>Scania</a> and <a>Caoa</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_64">[64]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_65">[65]</a></sup>

In 2011, Brazil had the sixth largest <a>chemical industry</a> in the world, with net sales of US$157 billion, or 3.1% of world sales. At that time, there were 973 chemical factories for industrial use. They are concentrated in the Southeast Region, mainly in São Paulo. The chemical industry contributed 2.7% to the Brazilian GDP in 2012 and was established as the fourth largest sector in the manufacturing industry. Despite registering one of the largest sales in the sector in the world, the Brazilian chemical industry, in 2012 and 2013, experienced a strong transfer of production abroad, with a drop in national industrial production and an increase in imports. A third of consumption in the country was supplied by imports. 448 products stopped being manufactured in Brazil between 1990 and 2012. This led to the interruption of 1,710 production lines. In 1990, the share of imported products in Brazilian consumption was only 7%, in 2012 it was 30%. The main companies in the sector in Brazil are: <a>Braskem</a>, <a>BASF</a>, <a>Bayer</a>, among others. In 2018, the Brazilian chemical sector was the eighth largest in the world, representing 10% of national industrial GDP and 2.5% of total GDP. In 2020, imports will occupy 43% of the internal demand for chemical products. Since 2008, the average use of capacity in the Brazilian chemical industry has been at a level considered low, ranging from 70 to 83%.<sup><a href="#ref_68">[68]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_69">[69]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_70">[70]</a></sup>

In the <a>Pharmaceutical Industry</a>, most companies in Brazil have been established in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro for a long time. In 2019, the situation was that, due to the tax advantages offered in states like Pernambuco, Goiás and Minas Gerais, companies left RJ and SP and went to these states. In 2017, Brazil was considered the sixth largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Drug sales in pharmacies reached around R $57 billion (US$17.79 billion) in the country. The pharmaceutical market in Brazil had 241 regularized and authorized laboratories for the sale of medicines. Of these, the majority (60%) have national capital. Multinational companies had approximately 52.44% of the market, with 34.75% in commercialized packaging. Brazilian laboratories represent 47.56% of the market in sales and 65.25% in boxes sold. In the distribution of medicine sales by state, São Paulo ranked first: São Paulo's pharmaceutical industry had a turnover of R $53.3 billion, 76.8% of total sales across the country. The companies that benefited the most from the sale of medicines in the country in 2015 were <a>EMS</a>, <a>Hypermarcas</a> (NeoQuímica), <a>Sanofi</a> (Medley), <a>Novartis</a>, <a>Aché</a>, <a>Eurofarma</a>, <a>Takeda</a>, <a>Bayer</a>, <a>Pfizer</a> and <a>GSK</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_74">[74]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup>

In the <a>footwear industry</a>, in 2019 Brazil produced 972 million pairs. Exports were around 10%, reaching almost 125 million pairs. Brazil ranks fourth among world producers, behind China, India and Vietnam, and 11th among the largest exporters. Of the pairs produced, 49% were made of plastic or rubber, 28.8% were made of synthetic laminate, and only 17.7% were made of leather. The largest polo in Brazil is located in Rio Grande do Sul, but São Paulo has important shoe centers, such as the one in the city of <a>Franca</a>, specialized in men's footwear, in the city of <a>Jaú</a>, specialized in women's footwear and in the city of <a>Birigui</a>, specialized in children's footwear. Jaú, Franca and Birigui represent 92% of footwear production in the state of São Paulo. Birigui has 350 companies, which generate around 13 thousand jobs, producing 45.9 million pairs per year. 52% of children's shoes in the country are produced in this city. From Birigui came the majority of the most famous children's shoe factories in the country. Jaú has 150 factories that produce around 130 thousand pairs of cheap women's shoes per day. The footwear sector in Franca has around 550 companies and employs around 20,000 employees. Most of the country's most famous men's shoe factories come from São Paulo. Overall, however, the Brazilian industry has been struggling to compete with Chinese footwear, which has an unbeatable price due to the difference in tax collection from one country to another, in addition to the absence of strong Brazilian labor taxes in China. Brazilian businessmen have had to invest in value-added products, combining quality and design, in order to survive.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup>

In the <a>textile industry</a>, Brazil, despite being among the 5 largest producers in the world in 2013, and being representative in the consumption of textiles and clothing, has very little insertion in world trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5 billion). And in exports, it was only 40th in the world ranking. Brazil's share of world textile and clothing trade is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers from India and mainly from China. The gross value of production, which includes the consumption of intermediate goods and services, of the Brazilian textile industry corresponded to almost R $40 billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of industrial production in Brazil. São Paulo (37.4%) is the largest producer. The main productive areas of São Paulo are the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo and Campinas.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup>

In <a>Electronics industry</a>, the billing of industries in Brazil reached R $153.0 billion in 2019, about 3% of national GDP. The number of employees in the sector was 234.5 thousand people. Exports were $5.6 billion, and the country's imports were $32.0 billion. Brazil, despite decades-long efforts to rid itself of dependence on technology imports, has yet to reach this level. Imports are concentrated on expensive components such as processors, microcontrollers, memories, magnetic disks, lasers, LEDs and LCDs mounted below. The cables for telecommunications and electricity distribution, cables, optical fibers and connectors are manufactured in the country. Brazil has two large centers for the production of electronic products, located in the Metropolitan Region of <a>Campinas</a>, in the State of São Paulo, and in the Free Trade Zone of Manaus, in the State of Amazonas. There are large, internationally renowned technology companies as well as part of the industries that participate in its supply chain. The country also has other smaller centers, such as the municipalities of <a>São José dos Campos</a> and <a>São Carlos</a>, in the state of São Paulo.

</p>
<p>
<a>São Paulo</a>, the state capital city is the center of business tourism in <a>Brazil</a>, which gives the city about 45,000 events per year. São Paulo also has the largest hotel network in Brazil. Because of real estate speculation in the mid-1990s, nowadays there is an excess supply in the number of vacancies. The city also has demand in gastronomic culinary  tourism after receiving the title of the "World Capital of <a>Gastronomy</a>. Cultural tourism is also highlighted given the amount of museums, theaters and events like the Biennale and the Biennale of Arts of the Book.

</p>
<p>
The coast of São Paulo state along the <a>South Atlantic Ocean</a> has 622 km of beaches of all kinds and sizes. Among the cities that receive the most tourists in the summer are <a>Santos</a>, <a>Praia Grande</a>, <a>Ubatuba</a>, <a>São Sebastião</a>, among others.

<p>
Those looking for intense entertainment can browse the <a>Hopi Hari</a>, a major theme park in Brazil, in the Metropolitan Region of <a>Campinas</a>; the complex also includes a hotel and the <a>water park</a> Wet 'n Wild. Also you can find the Parque Aquático Thermas dos Laranjais, which is the most visited water park in Latin America and the fifth in the world, located in <a>Olímpia</a>, a municipality in the northern part of the state. In terms of ecotourism, Sprout Juquitiba has a fine infrastructure. In winter, the city of <a>Campos do Jordão</a> emerges as the main tourist reference state, with the Winter Festival and several other attractions in an environment where the temperature can drop down below 0 (zero) degrees (<a>Celsius</a>).

<p>
Every day nearly 100,000 people pass through <a>São Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport</a> (<a>IATA</a>: <b>GRU</b>, <a>ICAO</a>: <b>SBGR</b>), which connects Brazil to 28 countries. There are 370 companies established there, generating 53,000 jobs. The original airport's two terminals are designed to handle 20.5 million passengers a year, but the recently opened third terminal expanded the capacity for 42 million users.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
São Paulo International Airport is also one of the main air cargo hubs in Brazil. The roughly 100 cargo flights a day carry everything from fruits grown in the São Francisco Valley to medications. The airport's cargo terminal is South America's largest and stands behind only Mexico City's in all of Latin America. In 2013, over 343 thousand metric tons of freight passed through the container terminal.<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Congonhas-São Paulo Airport</a> or just Congonhas Airport (<a>IATA</a>: <b>CGH</b>, <a>ICAO</a>: <b>SBSP</b>) is one of São Paulo's three commercial airports, situated 8 <a>kilometres</a> (5 <a>miles</a>) from the city downtown at <a>Washington Luís</a> Avenue, in the Campo Belo district. It is owned by the City of São Paulo and managed by <a>Infraero</a>. In 2013, it was the <a>busiest airport</a> in Brazil in terms of aircraft movements and the second busiest in terms of passengers, handling 209,555 aircraft movements and 17,119,530 passengers.<sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Located 14 kilometers from downtown <a>Campinas</a> and 99 kilometers from the city of São Paulo, <a>Viracopos-Campinas International Airport</a> (<a>IATA</a>: <b>VCP</b>, <a>ICAO</a>: <b>SBKP</b>) can be reached by three highways: Santos Dumont, Bandeirantes and Anhanguera. The city of <a>Campinas</a> is one of Brazil's leaders in <a>technology</a>. Besides excellent highway connections, it is the location of major universities and many high-tech companies. Because of this, the airport is one of Infraero's highest investment priorities. The old "landing field" as it was called has become one of the main connection points in Latin America.

</p>
<p>
The air cargo import/export terminal of Campinas has an area of over 81,000 square meters. The airport began to concentrate in the international air cargo sector in the 1990s and today this is the airports leading source of revenue. Since 1995, <a>Infraero</a> has been investing to implement the first phase of the airport's master plan, making major improvements to the cargo and passenger terminals. The first phase was completed in the first half of 2004, when the <a>airport</a> received new departure and arrival lounges, public areas and commercial concessions. In 2012, the airport received a <a>new terminal</a>, it has since been privatized.

</p>
<p>
In rail transport, the state has more than 5,000 km (3,100 mi) of railways, which comes from the banks of the <a>Parana River</a> on the border of São Paulo and <a>Mato Grosso do Sul</a>, to the <a>Port of Santos</a>, on the Atlantic coast, for the carriage of goods. The first of such <a>urban transit</a> systems in Brazil and <a>South America</a>, it began operations in 1974. It consists of four color-coded lines: Line 1-Blue, Line 2-Green, Line 3-Red and Line 5-Lilac; Line 4-Yellow started to work in May 2010, and will be completed only in 2016.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The metro system carries 2.8 million passengers a day. Metro itself is far from covering the entire urban area in the city of São Paulo. Another company, <a>Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos</a> (CPTM), ["São Paulo Metropolitan Train Company"] works along with the metro system and runs additional <a>commuter</a> railways converted into <a>light rail</a> service lines, which total six lines (numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12), 261 km long, serving 89 stations. Metro and CPTM are integrated through various stations. Metro and CPTM both operate as state-owned companies, and have received awards in the recent past as one of the cleanest systems in the world by ISO9001. The São Paulo metro transports three million people by day. A <a>regional rail</a> network is also proposed.

</p>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_system_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo">Highway system of São Paulo</a></div>
<p>
The <a>highway system of São Paulo</a> is the largest state system of the <a>Brazilian Highway System</a>, surpassing the 35,000 km (22,000 mi). It is an interconnected network, divided into three levels: municipal (12,000 km (7,500 mi)); state (22,000 km (14,000 mi)); and federal (1,050 km (650 mi)). More than 90% of São Paulo population is about 5 km (3.1 mi) from a paved road.<sup><a href="#ref_93">[93]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
São Paulo has the largest number of <a>highways</a> of <a>Latin America</a> and, according to a survey by the Confederação Nacional do Transporte (<i>National Transport Confederation</i>), the road system of the state is the best in Brazil, with 59.4% of its roads classified as "excellent".<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> The survey also found that of the 10 best Brazilian highways, nine are in São Paulo.<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The São Paulo highway system, however, is heavily criticized for the high cost imposed on its users. The state of São Paulo concentrates more than half of the <a>toll roads</a> in Brazil and a new toll plaza is created every 40 days average. According to a report of the <i><a>Folha de S. Paulo</a></i>, the cost of tolls to travel the coastal path of 4,500 km (2,800 mi) of the federal highway <a>BR-101</a>, which connect <a>Rio Grande do Norte</a> to <a>Rio Grande do Sul</a>, is cheaper than to go through the 313 km (194 mi) of highways separating the <a>municipalities</a> of <a>São Paulo</a> and <a>Ribeirão Preto</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> The prices charged by private concessionaires who run the system are frequent targets of complaints from drivers.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Ports">Ports</h3>
<p>
In maritime transport, the state of São Paulo has two major ports: the <a>Port of Santos</a>, located in municipality of <a>Santos</a> and occupies the <a>39th position in the world by containerized cargo</a>; and the Port of São Sebastião, located in <a>São Sebastião</a> (<i>San Sebastian</i>) municipality.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup>

São Paulo state is a cosmopolitan region, a land influenced by its encounter with different traditions beginning with the <a>Tupi-Guarani</a> Native American nation, the intrusion of <a>Iberian</a> and other <a>European</a> elements and the traffic of enslaved <a>Africans</a>. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, European, <a>Asian</a>, and <a>Middle-Eastern</a> immigrants also made their way there. Earlier, the land had been the starting point of the <a>bandeirantes</a> expeditions, which sought to enslave the Natives of the hinterlands and explore their mineral wealth. Hence, São Paulo influenced most of Western Brazil, as well as the states of <a>Minas Gerais</a>, its neighbor north of it, and <a>Paraná</a>, which was originally part of the old São Paulo province.

</p>
<p>
A very distinctive character in the culture of São Paulo state is the <a>Caipira</a> tradition, a mixture of Luso-Native-Brazilian and immigrant elements, mainly <a>southern Italian</a>, which influenced its dialect, somewhat different from the Portuguese language spoken in São Paulo city, although the latter is also heavily Italianized. The caipira culture is strong in countryside cities, although centers like <a>Piracicaba</a>, <a>São Carlos</a>, <a>São José do Rio Preto</a>, <a>Araraquara</a>, <a>Ribeirão Preto</a>, <a>Barretos</a>, <a>Campinas</a>, <a>Marilia</a>, <a>Assis</a>, <a>Presidente Prudente</a>, <a>Jaú</a> and <a>Bauru</a> also have a strong <a>retroflex R</a> style of  pronunciation and unusual usage of words. It seems that the influence is actually from the <a>Calabrian</a> or <a>Sicilian Italian</a> dialect though, and many of the words peculiar to the region are actually archaic Portuguese forms. Native languages might<sup>[<i><a><span>dubious</span></a><span> – <a>discuss</a></span></i>]</sup> also have stressed the more nasal sounds of words ending in /m/ or /n/, which is also a feature of other dialects in Brazil.<sup>[<i><a><span>citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Cuisine">Cuisine</h3>
<p>
Caipira food typically includes fried or barbecued beef steaks; fried eggs; <i>couve</i> (collard green); <i>taioba</i> (cabbage); <i>manioc</i> (corn flour); <i>farofa</i> (stuffing); <i>frango Caipira</i> (freshly baked or pan-seared chicken); <i>frango a Passarinho</i> (fried chicken pieces of chicken); fried breaded sardine or fish fillet; and pork chops or baked pork with lettuce or cabbage and tomato, seasoned with garlic, lemon, and onions. Bean stew with <i>carne seca</i> (dried charque beef), <i>toicinho</i> (bacon) and white rice is always the staple, but <i>macarronada</i> (spaghetti) is always present on Sunday luncheons, and fried sausages are often eaten daily. Mildly spiced legumes, as well as zucchini and other types of squash, are often prepared as a stew with or without meat, and sometimes with quiabo (ocra) and abobora or butternut squash are a favorite dessert, as are sweetened sidra, canjica (white corn kernels cooked in milk, coconut, and condensed milk and peanut bits). Pudim de leite, or milk custard, pave' (mounted cookies in rich condensed and heavy cream sauce) and manjar (white flan) are other mouth-watering treats. If none of these desserts are present, countryside meals will rarely leave out citrics such as oranges and mexericas, bananas, caquis or abacaxi (pineapple). Home-made loaves or regular bakery fresh rolls with butter or corn meal or orange cakes are served with coffee and milk or mate tea in the afternoon before dinner or before bed. Pastries like chicken coxinha fried dumplings and risolis, and the Mediterranean or Syrian-Lebanese kibe and open sfihas are often served in birthday and wedding parties followed by a glazed cake, guarana' and other sodas, champagne, caipirinha sugar-cane liquor or beer. Chopp or draft beer is a must in weddings celebrations.

</p>
<h3 id="Fine_arts">Fine arts</h3>
<p>
Another distinctive character in the state of São Paulo is the so-called "Brazilian erudite culture". São Paulo was the home of the Brazilian <a>Week of Modern Art</a> (Semana da Arte Moderna), organized mostly by poets and artists from São Paulo, like <a>Mário de Andrade</a>, <a>Oswald de Andrade</a>, <a>Menotti del Picchia</a>, <a>Tarsila do Amaral</a> and <a>Anita Malfatti</a>, <a>Victor Brecheret</a> and <a>Lasar Segall</a>. São Paulo was also the birthplace of Brazilian classical composers, like <a>Carlos Gomes</a> (the most famous Brazilian opera composer), <a>Elias Álvares Lobo</a> and <a>Camargo Guarnieri</a>. OSESP, the São Paulo state orchestra is known internationally and it has had both national and international directors.

</p>
<h3 id="Museums">Museums</h3>
<p>
São Paulo has some of the most impressive museums in the country, such as the <a>Museu Paulista do Ipiranga</a>, which honors the site of the independence of Brazil and has numerous Native American artifacts, funeral urns and other historic objects, besides the monument resting place of <a>Dom Pedro</a>,  Brazil's first emperor and his wife. The <a>Museu de Arte de São Paulo</a> or MASP on Avenida Paulista is the most important <a>Latin American</a> collection of European paintings, and the <a>Pinacoteca do Estado</a> on Avenida Tiradentes exhibits paintings and sculptures. The <a>Museu de Arte Sacra</a> on the same avenue features national Barroc art and an <a>Italian</a> nativity scene, besides having in the chapel next door, the tomb of <a>Frei Galvão</a>, the first Brazilian saint. Across from <a>Pinacoteca</a> is the Luz station built in <a>Britain</a> and assembled in Brazil with the innovating <a>Museu da Língua Portuguesa</a>, the first interactive language museum in the world. <a>Ibirapuera Park</a> features <a>Museu do Presepio</a> or Creche museum, <a>AfroBrasil</a>, the African-Brazilian museum, and the Bienal book and art fair site conducted every two years. The city of <a>São Carlos</a> in the center of the state has the <a>Museu do Avião</a>, an open airplane museum.
