The island is part of the <a>Republic of Malta</a>. After the <a>island of Malta</a> itself, it is the second-largest island in the archipelago.

</p>
<p>
As of  2021, the island has a population of around 31,232 (out of Malta's total 443,227),<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> and its inhabitants are known as Gozitans (<a>Maltese</a>: <i>Għawdxin</i>). It is rich in historic locations such as the <a>Ġgantija</a> temples, which, along with the other <a>Megalithic Temples of Malta</a>, are among the world's oldest free-standing structures.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The island is rural in character and less developed than the island of Malta. Gozo is known for its scenic hills, which are featured on its <a>coat of arms</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> The <a>Azure Window</a>, a natural limestone arch, was a remarkable geological feature until its collapse on March 8, 2017. The island has other notable natural features, including the <a>Inland Sea</a> and <a>Wied il-Mielaħ Window</a>. There are few sandy <a>beaches</a> on the island, all small, as well as seaside resorts that are popular with both locals and tourists, the most popular being <a>Marsalforn</a> and <a>Xlendi</a>. Gozo is considered one of the top diving destinations in the Mediterranean and a centre for water sports.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>
Gozo has been inhabited since 5000 BC, when farmers from nearby <a>Sicily</a> crossed the sea to the island.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> Due to the discovery of similar pottery found in both places from the <a>Għar Dalam phase</a>, it has been suggested that the first <a>colonists</a> were specifically from the area of <a>Agrigento</a>; however, it is currently unknown exactly where in Sicily the farmers came from. They are thought to have first lived in caves on the outskirts of what is now known as <a>San Lawrenz</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Gozo was an important place for cultural evolution, and during the <a>neolithic</a> period the <a>Ġgantija</a> temples were built; they are among the world's oldest free-standing structures, as well as the world's oldest religious structures. The temple's name is <a>Maltese</a> for "belonging to the giants", because legend in Maltese and Gozitan folklore says the temples were built by giants.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> Another important Maltese archaeological site in Gozo, which dates back to the neolithic period, is the <a>Xagħra Stone Circle</a>. Also, native tradition and certain ancient Greek historians (notably <a>Euhemerus</a> and <a>Callimachus</a>) maintain that Gozo is the island Homer described as <a>Ogygia</a>, home of the nymph <a>Calypso</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup><a>Diodorus Siculus</a>  writes that the island had many well harbors.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Gozo was occupied by the <a>Carthaginians</a>, who built a temple to <a>Astarte</a> on the islands.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> It was probably annexed by <a>Rome</a> around 218<span></span>BC and minted its own <a>bronze</a> coins in the 1st century<span></span>BC. These feature Astarte's head with a crescent <a>obverse</a> and a warrior, a star, and the legend <i>Gaulitōn</i> (<a>Greek</a>: <span><span>ΓΑΥΛΙΤΩΝ</span></span>) <a>reverse</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In July 1551 <a>Ottomans</a> under <a>Sinan Pasha</a> and <a>Dragut</a><a>invaded</a>  and ravaged Gozo and <a>enslaved</a> most of its inhabitants, about 5,000, bringing them to Tarhuna Wa Msalata in <a>Libya</a>, their departure port in Gozo was <a>Mġarr ix-Xini</a>. The island of Gozo was repopulated between 1565 and 1580 by people from mainland Malta, undertaken by the <a>Knights of Malta</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Welcome_to_Gozo.jpg/220px-Welcome_to_Gozo.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The history of Gozo is strongly coupled with the <a>history of Malta</a>, since Gozo has been governed by Malta throughout history. The brief exception was following the French garrisons surrender to the British under Captain <a>Alexander Ball</a> on 28 October 1798 during the <a>uprising</a> against <a>French forces</a> after Napoleon's conquest of Malta. Gozo then enjoyed a <a>short period of autonomy</a> until the French garrison in <a>Valletta</a> surrendered on 4 September 1800. On that day both Malta and Gozo became a <a>British Protectorate</a> before becoming a <a>Crown colony</a> in 1813.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Gozo Civic Council</a> was set up as a statutory local government in the island of Gozo on 14 April 1961, the first experiment in civil local government in Malta since Gozo's short period of autonomy between 1798–1800. The law authorised the Council to raise taxes, although it never actually made use of this power. In 1971 the <a>Malta Labour Party</a> was voted into office. As its support in Gozo was weak and it favoured a more centralised administration, it proposed a referendum on the abolition of the Council, putting emphasis on the unpopular possibility of its raising taxes. In the <a>Gozo Civic Council referendum, 1973</a>, the overwhelming majority of voters (76.97%) voted for the abolition of the Gozo Civic Council.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the mid-1980s attempts were made to set up a Gozo committee, chaired by the <a>prime minister</a> and with the Gozitan <a>members of Parliament</a> as members. However, it was only in 1987 that the <a>Ministry of Gozo</a> was set up (demoted to a parliamentary secretariat between 1996 and 1998). Local government in the Gozitan localities was restored with the introduction of <a>local councils</a> in 1993 with Gozo having 14 councils.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Religion">Religion</h2>
<p>
The island has its own Latin bishopric, the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of Gozo</a>, the only <a>suffragan</a> of the Metropolitan <a>Archbishop of Malta</a>. 
Gozo contains a large number of Catholic churches. The <a>Rotunda of Xewkija</a>, in the village of <a>Xewkija</a>, has a capacity of 3,000, enough for the entire population of Xewkija village; its dome is larger than that of <a>St Paul's Cathedral</a> in London. The church bells are rung daily for the <a>canonical hours</a> Matins, Lauds, Terce, Sext, None and vespers.
The most famous church on the island is the sanctuary of <a>Ta' Pinu</a>, near the village of <a>Għarb</a>, in the west of Gozo.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Connection_between%20Malta%20and%20Gozo">Connection between Malta and Gozo</h2>
<p>
The islands have historically been connected by air and sea links.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> However, a helicopter service which connected the two ceased operations in 2006.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>

<p>
Visitors can currently reach the island by ferry. There are regular crossings between the port of <a>Mġarr</a> on Gozo and <a>Ċirkewwa</a> on the north-west coast of Malta. The <a>Gozo Channel Line</a> makes the trip every 45 minutes during the summer and almost as often in the winter. A return journey costs €4.65 and takes around 25 minutes each way. The service is used by tourists and commuters (including Gozitan students who are studying at the <a>University of Malta</a>), and is also used to transport goods between the islands. Each year, the route is used by around 1.1 million cars, and many more foot passengers.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> On arrival at Mġarr, visitors can take one of the 'Hop On Hop Off' buses, which depart from outside the ferry terminal and operate on a timetable synchronized to the ferry timetables. Public buses, taxis and hire cars are also available.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>

<p>
Several proposals have been made to construct a road link between Malta and Gozo. In 1972<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> the newly elected Labour Party administration carried out a feasibility study that concluded building a bridge between the two islands was possible, but would have negative environmental effects. A tunnel was also considered, but found to be too expensive at the time.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> An online poll by <i><a>The Times of Malta</a></i> in 2006 found that 55% of respondents supported a road link.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In June 2013 a "mega Chinese state-owned company [<a>China Communications Construction Corporation Limited</a>] will finance a €4 million study to assess the feasibility of a bridge between Malta and Gozo." "Depending on the feasibility of the tunnel and bridge projects, popular consultation will take place giving particular weight to what Gozitans have to say."<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> "Gozo Minister Anton Refalo alluded to the possibility of calling a referendum to determine whether Gozitans prefer a tunnel or a bridge to connect Malta and Gozo"<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The study found out that the bridge would take four years to build and construction would cost €1 billion. Apart from this, operation and maintenance costs are estimated to cost up to €4 million every year — China Communications Construction Corporation Limited is proposing to build the bridge by 2020.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The idea of building a bridge is opposed by environmentalists and NGOs such as <a>Din l-Art Ħelwa</a> and Flimkien għal Ambjent Aħjar.<sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
An 11-km underground Sub seabed tunnel has been proposed in a report on the viability of a Gozo-Malta tunnel link by the Gozo Business Chamber (GBC)  together with Transport Malta (TM). The Gozo Business Chamber is organising a Presentation by economist Gordon Cordina, of the detailed report about the feasibility of a ‘Gozo – Malta Subsea Tunnel.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup> In 2015, members from the GBC together with representatives from TM also visited Norway, where they spoke with experts, and toured several underwater tunnels.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In December 2015, a group of students joined forces to create 'Front Favur il-Mina' to support permanent connectivity, tunnel project between Malta and its sister island. Several Members of Parliament endorsed the group.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> A catamaran service (fast ferry) to Gozo, ferry trips from Grand Harbour and ultimately a tunnel linking Malta with the sister island are the main proposals pushed forward by the pressure group.<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup> Addressing a conference in Gozo organised by the pro-tunnel movement, Muscat said the government intends to move forward with a project linking the two islands. Furthermore, opposition leader Simon Busuttil confirmed during the same conference, that the PN is in favour of the project and willing to cooperate with the government.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The University of Malta carried out geological and geophysical investigations in connection with a proposed sub-sea tunnel between Malta and Gozo following an agreement with Transport Malta. Scientific investigations included both desktop and field studies, passive seismic measurements, bathymetric mapping, and a seismic study. The University of Malta conducted a marine baseline study which incorporated a geological model of topography, stratigraphy, structure, geological, geophysical and tectonic properties of the study area.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> During this phase of the study, scientists deployed a 300-metre-long cable with a series of specialised receptors. An ‘air gun’ released bursts of compressed air every few metres. The compressed air was reflected to the receptors. Different geological layers reflect different frequencies. Scientists can thus determine the geological formations that lie beneath the surface and determine possible cracks. Following such tests, more tests will be carried out; these will consist in the drilling of a series of boreholes, up to 200 metres below the sea bed, to determine the rock strata below the surface.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
"Expressions of interest have been issued for a fast <a>catamaran</a> service between Gozo and Valletta as well as between Gozo and Sicily." In June 2013, the services would be aimed for use by both tourists and Maltese and would involve public service obligations.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
An airstrip for fixed-wing aircraft on Gozo was proposed in the 1990s, but rejected for environmental reasons.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>
In June 2013: "The government intends to issue a call for expressions of interest for the operation of a scheduled air service between Malta and Gozo."<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup>

Many of the distances within villages are negligible and some of the roads are fairly quiet and pleasant to walk along. However, there is often heavy traffic in the capital, Victoria and between Victoria and the Malta ferry. There is also a footpath network, though the paths require good shoes and a good map (they are not always clearly marked on the ground). There are longer distances if travelling between different villages, ranging from 1 to 5 km (1 to 3 mi) from one village to the next.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup>

Though <a>Arriva</a> ceased to operate in Gozo and Malta, in January 2014, their old vehicles are still being utilised and most routes remain the same, although there have been some amendments and additions. The most noticeable change at the moment is that the discrepancy between resident and non-resident fares has been abolished with all passengers now paying €2 for a 2-hour ticket in summer and €1.50 for the same ticket in winter, although other fares apply for the <a>Tallinja Card</a> holders.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>

A hop-on hop-off bus service operates in Gozo. The open top bus tour of Gozo starts from the harbour of <a>Mġarr</a> and there are stops located along the route.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> In Gozo, there are 2 providers, <a>City Sightseeing</a> Gozo and Gozo Sightseeing.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup>

Gozo is famed for its character and places of interest. Some of these include the Calypso's Cave (from <a>Homer's Odyssey</a>, where the island is called <a>Ogygia</a>) and the <a>Ġgantija</a> Neolithic temples which are among the oldest surviving man-made structures.<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Gozo covers 67 square kilometres (26 sq mi), approximately the same area as <a>New York City</a>'s <a>Manhattan</a> island. It lies approximately 6 kilometres (4 mi) northwest of the nearest point of Malta, is of oval form, and is 14 kilometres (8.7 mi) long and 7.25 kilometres (4.50 mi) wide.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>

<p>
Gozo is known for Nadur carnival. Feasts are important traditions on the island and are held in honour of the patron saint of each village.  The celebrations include religious ceremonies, fireworks and live band music, some feature horse racing, concerts, and a greasy pole competition over the water.<sup><a href="#ref_50">[50]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Local feast allow time for Gozitans people to meet. In the village of Nadur many locals dress up in colourful and outrageous carnival costumes, with the intention of not being recognised.<sup><a href="#ref_51">[51]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Some of <a>Maltese dishes or variants of these dishes</a> are associated with Gozo. Gozo is particularly known for its local <a>cheeselet</a>, <i>ġbejna t'Għawdex</i>.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Gozo has two opera houses. Astra and Aurora are owned by rival band clubs that both trace their founding to 1863. For over a century they have been one-upping each other in everything from musical performances to feast-day celebrations. Once, when Aurora heard rumors that Astra planned to bring a horse onstage during a performance of <i>Aida</i>, the competing house—which was presenting its own <i>Aida</i>—secretly cast <i>two</i> horses. Some locals on the island compare the rivalry to an arms race.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup>

<p>
During the Summer months on Gozo you will often see the Maltese Wall Lizard. The wall lizard of Malta was originally thought to be a variety of the Common Wall Lizard (Podarcis muralis) of mainland Europe. For example, the naturalist Andrew Leith Adams writing in 1870 reported "the common lizard (Podarcis mura/is)" as occurring on the Islands. In 1876, Dr. J. Bedriaga named this Maltese variety filjolensis since the animals he studied came from the islet of Filfla. Later studies, however, showed that the lizards of the Maltese Islands were actually quite different from the Common Wall Lizard or any other species in the region and therefore Bedriaga's filjolensis became established as a distinct species whose full modern name is Podarcis filjolensis -  the Maltese Wall Lizard.

Gozo was used to depict "Resolution Island" in the 1953 film <i><a>Single-Handed</a></i>, based on <a>C. S. Forester</a>'s book <i><a>Brown on Resolution</a></i>. For much of the film, the German raider <i>Essen</i> (depicted by <a>HMS <i>Manxman</i></a>) is holed up in the semi-circular <a>Dwejra</a> Bay, behind <a>Fungus Rock</a> on the west coast of Gozo, and there are several scenes set among the desolate limestone cliffs above the bay as Able Seaman Brown single-handedly detains the German ship until her pursuers can catch up with her.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>
