<b>Nevada</b> (<span><span><a>/<span><span>n</span><span>ɪ</span><span>ˈ</span><span>v</span><span>æ</span><span>d</span><span>ə</span><span>ˌ</span></span><span></span><span><span>n</span><span>ɪ</span><span>ˈ</span><span>v</span><span>ɑː</span><span>d</span><span>ə</span></span>/</a></span></span>, <small>Spanish: </small><span><a>[neˈβaða]</a></span>) is a <a>state</a> in the <a>Western</a> region of the <a>United States</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> It is bordered by <a>Oregon</a> to the northwest, <a>Idaho</a> to the northeast, <a>California</a> to the west, <a>Arizona</a> to the southeast, and <a>Utah</a> to the east. Nevada is the <a>7th-most extensive</a>, the <a>19th-least populous</a>, and the <a>9th-least densely populated</a> of the U.S. states. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in <a>Clark County</a>, which contains the <a>Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area</a>,<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> including three of the state's four largest incorporated cities.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup> Nevada's capital is <a>Carson City</a> while the largest city is <a>Las Vegas</a>.

</p>
<p>
Nevada is officially known as the "Silver State" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the "Battle Born State" because it achieved statehood during the <a>Civil War</a> (the words "Battle Born" also appear on the <a>state flag</a>); as the "Sagebrush State", for the native <a>plant of the same name</a>; and as the "<a>Sage-hen</a> State".<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup>  The name means "snowy" in <a>Spanish</a>, referring to Nevada's small overlap with the <a>Sierra Nevada</a> mountain range; however, the rest of Nevada is largely <a>desert</a> and semi-arid, much of it within the <a>Great Basin</a>. Areas south of the Great Basin are within the <a>Mojave Desert</a>, while <a>Lake Tahoe</a> and the Sierra Nevada lie on the western edge. About 86% of the state's land is managed by various jurisdictions of the <a>U.S. federal government</a>, both civilian and military.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>American Indians</a> of the <a>Paiute</a>, <a>Shoshone</a>, and <a>Washoe</a> tribes inhabited what is now Nevada. The first Europeans to explore the region were Spanish. They called the region <i>Nevada</i> (snowy) because of the snow which covered the mountains in winter similar to the <a>Sierra Nevada</a> in Spain. The area formed part of <a>Alta California</a>'s territory within the <a>Viceroyalty of New Spain</a>, which gained independence as <a>Mexico</a> in 1821. The United States annexed the area in 1848 after its victory in the <a>Mexican–American War</a>, and it was incorporated as part of <a>Utah Territory</a> in 1850. The discovery of silver at the <a>Comstock Lode</a> in 1859 led to a population boom that became an impetus to the creation of <a>Nevada Territory</a> out of western Utah Territory in 1861. Nevada became the 36th state on October 31, 1864, as the second of two states added to the Union during the Civil War (the first being <a>West Virginia</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nevada has a reputation for its <a>libertarian</a> laws. In 1940, with a <a>population</a> of just over 110,000 people, Nevada was by far the least-populated state, with less than half the population of the next least-populous state, <a>Wyoming</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> However, legalized <a>gambling</a> and <a>lenient marriage and divorce</a> laws transformed Nevada into a major tourist destination in the 20th century.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> Nevada is the only U.S. state where <a>prostitution</a> is legal, though it is illegal in its most populated regions – Clark County (Las Vegas), <a>Washoe County</a> (Reno) and Carson City (which, as an independent city, is not within the boundaries of any county). The tourism industry remains Nevada's largest employer,<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> with mining continuing as a substantial sector of the economy: Nevada is the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Etymology">Etymology</h2>
<p>
The name "Nevada" comes from the Spanish adjective <i>nevada</i><small></small><span><a>[neˈβaða]</a></span> , meaning "snow-covered" or “snowy”.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup> The state takes its name from the <a>Nevada Territory</a>, which in turn was named for the <a>Sierra Nevada</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nevadans pronounce the second syllable with the "a" of "trap" (<span><span><a>/<span><span>n</span><span>ɪ</span><span>ˈ</span><span>v</span><span>æ</span><span>d</span><span>ə</span></span>/</a></span></span>) while some people from outside of the state pronounce it with the "a" of "palm" (<span><span><a>/<span><span>n</span><span>ɪ</span><span>ˈ</span><span>v</span><span>ɑː</span><span>d</span><span>ə</span></span>/</a></span></span>).<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup> Although the <a>quality</a>, but not the <a>length</a>, of the latter pronunciation could be perceived as closer to the Spanish pronunciation (<span>[æ]</span> is <a>near-low front</a>, <span>[ɑ]</span> is <a>low back</a> and <span>[a]</span> is <a>low front</a>, though often retracted to <a>central</a><span>[ä]</span>  in Spanish), it is not the pronunciation used by Nevadans. State Assemblyman <a>Harry Mortenson</a> proposed a bill to recognize the alternative pronunciation of Nevada,<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup> though the bill was not supported by most legislators and never received a vote. The Nevadan pronunciation is the one used by the state legislature. At one time, the state's official tourism organization, TravelNevada, stylized the name of the state as "Nevăda", with a <a>breve</a> over the <i>a</i> indicating the locally preferred pronunciation,<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> which was also available as a license plate design until 2007.<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup>

<p>
<a>Francisco Garcés</a> was the first European in the area.<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> Nevada was annexed as a part of the <a>Spanish Empire</a> in the northwestern territory of <a>New Spain</a>. Administratively, the area of Nevada was part of the <a>Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas</a> in the Viceroyalty of New Spain. Nevada became a part of <a>Alta California</a> (Upper California) province in 1804 when <a>the Californias</a> were split. With the <a>Mexican War of Independence</a> won in 1821, the province of Alta California became a territory (state) of Mexico, with a small population. <a>Jedediah Smith</a> entered the <a>Las Vegas Valley</a> in 1827, and <a>Peter Skene Ogden</a> traveled the <a>Humboldt River</a> in 1828. When the Mormons created the <a>State of Deseret</a> in 1847, they laid claim to all of Nevada within the Great Basin and the Colorado watershed. They also founded the first white settlement in what is now Nevada, <a>Mormon Station</a> (modern-day Genoa), in 1851. In June 1855, William Bringhurst and 29 fellow Mormon missionaries from Utah arrived at a site just northeast of downtown Las Vegas and built a 150-foot square adobe fort, the first permanent structure erected in the valley, which remained under the control of Salt Lake City until the winter of 1858–1859.

</p>
<p>
As a result of the <a>Mexican–American War</a> and the <a>Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo</a>, <a>Mexico</a> permanently lost Alta California in 1848. The new areas acquired by the United States continued to be administered as territories. As part of the <a>Mexican Cession</a> (1848) and the subsequent <a>California Gold Rush</a> that used <a>Emigrant Trails</a> through the area, the <a>state's area evolved</a> first as part of the <a>Utah Territory</a>, then the <a>Nevada Territory</a> (March 2, 1861; named for the <a>Sierra Nevada</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>

The first discovery of a major U.S. deposit of <a>silver ore</a> occurred in <a>Comstock Lode</a> under <a>Virginia City, Nevada</a>, in 1859.

<p>
On March 2, 1861, the Nevada Territory separated from the Utah Territory and adopted its current name, shortened from <i>The Sierra Nevada</i> (Spanish for "snow-covered mountain range"). The 1861 southern boundary is commemorated by <a>Nevada Historical Markers</a> 57 and 58 in Lincoln and Nye counties.

<p>
Eight days before the <a>presidential election of 1864</a>, Nevada became the 36th state in the union, despite lacking the minimum 60,000 residents that <a>Congress</a> typically required a potential state to have in order to become a state.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup> (At the time, Nevada's population was little more than 10,000.) Governor Nye was frustrated that previous attempts to send the constitution via overland mail and by sea had failed by October 24, so on October 26 the full text was sent by telegraph at a cost of $4,303.27<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup> – the most costly telegraph on file at the time for a single dispatch, equivalent to $71,205.38 in 2020. Finally, the response from Washington came on October 31, 1864: "the pain is over, the child is born, Nevada this day was admitted into the Union". Statehood was rushed to the date of October 31 to help ensure <a>Abraham Lincoln</a>'s reelection on November<span></span>8 and post-Civil War <a>Republican</a> dominance in Congress,<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> as Nevada's mining-based economy tied it to the more industrialized <a>Union</a>. As it turned out, however, Lincoln and the Republicans won the election handily and did not need Nevada's help.

</p>
<p>
Nevada is one of only two states to significantly expand its borders after admission to the Union, with the other being <a>Missouri</a>, which acquired additional territory in 1837 due to the <a>Platte Purchase</a>.

</p>
<p>
In 1866 another part of the western Utah Territory was added to Nevada in the eastern part of the state, setting the current eastern boundary.

</p>
<p>
Nevada achieved its current southern boundaries on January 18, 1867, when it absorbed the portion of <a>Pah-Ute County</a> in the <a>Arizona Territory</a> west of the Colorado River, essentially all of present-day Nevada south of the <a>37th parallel</a>. The transfer was prompted by the discovery of gold in the area, and officials thought Nevada would be better able to oversee the expected population boom. This area includes most of what is now <a>Clark County</a> and the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

</p>
<p>
Mining shaped Nevada's economy for many years (see <i><a>Silver mining in Nevada</a></i>). When <a>Mark Twain</a> lived in Nevada during the period described in <i><a>Roughing It</a></i>, mining had led to an industry of speculation and immense wealth. Both mining and population temporarily declined in the late 19th century. However, the rich silver strike at <a>Tonopah</a> in 1900, followed by strikes in <a>Goldfield</a> and <a>Rhyolite</a>, created a second mining boom in  Nevada and Nevada's population.

</p>
<p>
Unregulated <a>gambling</a> was commonplace in the early Nevada mining towns but was outlawed in 1909 as part of a nationwide anti-gambling crusade. Because of subsequent declines in mining output and the decline of the agricultural sector during the <a>Great Depression</a>, Nevada again legalized gambling on March 19, 1931, with approval from the legislature. Governor <a>Fred B. Balzar</a>'s signature enacted the most liberal divorce laws in the country and open gambling. The reforms came just eight days after the federal government presented the $49<span></span>million construction contract for <a>Boulder Dam</a> (now <a>Hoover Dam</a>).<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Nevada Test Site</a>, 65 miles (105 km) northwest of the city of Las Vegas, was founded on January 11, 1951, for the testing of <a>nuclear weapons</a>. The site consists of about 1,350 square miles (3,500 km<sup>2</sup>) of the desert and mountainous terrain. <a>Nuclear testing</a> at the Nevada Test Site began with a 1 kiloton of TNT (4.2 TJ) bomb dropped on <a>Frenchman Flat</a> on January 27, 1951. The last atmospheric test was conducted on July 17, 1962, and the underground testing of weapons continued until September 23, 1992. The location is known for having the highest concentration of nuclear-detonated weapons in the U.S.

</p>
<p>
Over 80% of the state's area is owned by the federal government. The primary reason for this is <a>homesteads</a> were not permitted in large enough sizes to be viable in the arid conditions that prevail throughout desert Nevada. Instead, early settlers would homestead land surrounding a water source, and then graze livestock on the adjacent public land, which is useless for agriculture without access to water (this pattern of <a>ranching</a> still prevails).

<p>
Nevada is almost entirely within the <a>Basin and Range Province</a> and is broken up by many north–south mountain ranges. Most of these ranges have <a>endorheic</a> valleys between them.

</p>
<p>
Much of the northern part of the state is within the <a>Great Basin</a>, a mild desert that experiences hot temperatures in the summer and cold temperatures in the winter. Occasionally, moisture from the <a>Arizona Monsoon</a> will cause summer thunderstorms; Pacific storms may blanket the area with snow. The state's highest recorded temperature was 125 °F (52 °C) in <a>Laughlin</a> (elevation of 605 feet or 184 meters) on June 29, 1994.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> The coldest recorded temperature was −52 <a>°F</a> (−47 <a>°C</a>) set in San Jacinto in 1972, in the northeastern portion of the state.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Humboldt River</a> crosses the state from east to west across the northern part of the state, draining into the <a>Humboldt Sink</a> near <a>Lovelock</a>. Several rivers drain from the Sierra Nevada eastward, including the <a>Walker</a>, <a>Truckee</a>, and <a>Carson</a> rivers. All of these rivers are <a>endorheic basins</a>, ending in <a>Walker Lake</a>, <a>Pyramid Lake</a>, and the <a>Carson Sink</a>, respectively. However, not all of Nevada is within the Great Basin. Tributaries of the <a>Snake River</a> drain the far north, while the <a>Colorado River</a>, which also forms much of the boundary with <a>Arizona</a>, drains much of southern Nevada.

</p>
<p>
The mountain ranges, some of which have peaks above 13,000 feet (4,000 m), harbor lush forests high above desert plains, creating <a>sky islands</a> for endemic species. The valleys are often no lower in elevation than 3,000 feet (910 m), while some in central Nevada are above 6,000 feet (1,800 m).

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Charge%21_Little_Finland%2C_NV.jpg/220px-Charge%21_Little_Finland%2C_NV.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The southern third of the state, where the Las Vegas area is situated, is within the <a>Mojave Desert</a>. The area receives less rain in the winter but is closer to the Arizona Monsoon in the summer. The terrain is also lower, mostly below 4,000 feet (1,200 m), creating conditions for hot summer days and cool to chilly winter nights.

</p>
<p>
Nevada and California have by far the longest diagonal <a>line</a> (in respect to the cardinal directions) as a state <a>boundary</a> at just over 400 miles (640 km). This line begins in <a>Lake Tahoe</a> nearly 4 miles (6.4 km) offshore (in the direction of the boundary), and continues to the <a>Colorado River</a> where the Nevada, California, and Arizona boundaries merge 12 miles (19 km) southwest of the Laughlin Bridge.

</p>
<p>
The largest mountain range in the southern portion of the state is the <a>Spring Mountain Range</a>, just west of Las Vegas. The state's lowest point is along the Colorado River, south of Laughlin.

</p>
<p>
Nevada has 172 mountain summits with 2,000 feet (610 m) of prominence. Nevada ranks second in the United States by the number of mountains, behind Alaska, and ahead of California, Montana, and Washington.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup>

<p>
Nevada is the driest state in the United States.<sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup> It is made up of mostly desert and semi-arid climate regions, and, with the exception of the <a>Las Vegas Valley</a>, the average summer <a>diurnal temperature range</a> approaches 40 °F (22 °C) in much of the state. While winters in northern Nevada are long and fairly cold, the winter season in the southern part of the state tends to be of short duration and mild. Most parts of Nevada receive scarce precipitation during the year. The most rain that falls in the state falls on the east and northeast slopes of the <a>Sierra Nevada</a>.

</p>
<p>
The average annual rainfall per year is about 7 inches (180 mm); the wettest parts get around 40 inches (1,000 mm). Nevada's highest recorded temperature is 125 °F (52 °C) at <a>Laughlin</a> on June 29, 1994, and the lowest recorded temperature is −50 °F (−46 °C) at <a>San Jacinto</a> on January 8, 1937. Nevada's 125 °F (52 °C) reading is the third highest statewide record high temperature of a U.S. state, just behind Arizona's 128 °F (53 °C) reading and California's 134 °F (57 °C) reading.

The vegetation of Nevada is diverse and differs by state area. Nevada contains six <a>biotic zones</a>: <a>alpine</a>, <a>sub-alpine</a>, <a>ponderosa pine</a>, <a>pinion-juniper</a>, <a>sagebrush</a> and <a>creosotebush</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup>

Nevada is divided into political jurisdictions designated as <i><a>counties</a></i>. Carson City is officially a consolidated municipality; however, for many purposes under state law, it is considered to be a county. As of 1919, there were 17 counties in the state, ranging from 146 to 18,159 square miles (380 to 47,030 km<sup>2</sup>).

Clark County is the most populous county in Nevada, accounting for nearly three-quarters of its residents. Las Vegas, Nevada's most populous city, has been the <a>county seat</a> since the county was created in 1909 from a portion of <a>Lincoln County, Nevada</a>. Before that, it was a part of Arizona Territory. Clark County attracts numerous tourists: An estimated 44<span></span>million people visited Clark County in 2014.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>United States Census Bureau</a> determined Nevada had a population of 3,104,614 at the <a>2020 U.S. census</a>. In 2019, the estimated the population of Nevada was 3,080,156, an increase of 45,764 residents (1.51%) since the 2018 U.S. census estimate and an increase of 379,605 residents (14.06%) since the <a>2010 U.S. census</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Nevada had the highest percentage growth in population from 2017 to 2018. At the 2010 census, 6.9% of the state's population were reported as under 5, 24.6% were under 18, and 12.0% were 65 or older. Females made up about 49.5% of the population.

</p>
<p>
Since the 2010 census, the population of Nevada had a natural increase of 87,581 (the net difference between 222,508 births and 134,927 deaths); and an increase due to net migration of 146,626 (of which 104,032 was due to domestic and 42,594 was due to international migration).<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>center of population</a> of Nevada is in southern <a>Nye County</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> In this county, the unincorporated town of <a>Pahrump</a>, 60 miles (97 km) west of Las Vegas on the California state line, has grown very rapidly from 1980 to 2010. At the 2010 census, the town had 36,441 residents.<sup><a href="#ref_45">[45]</a></sup> Las Vegas grew from a gulch of 100 people in 1900 to 10,000 by 1950 to 100,000 by 1970, and was America's fastest-growing city and metropolitan area from 1960 to 2000.

</p>
<p>
From about the 1940s until 2003, Nevada was the fastest-growing state in the U.S. percentage-wise. Between 1990 and 2000, Nevada's population increased by 66%, while the nation's population increased by 13%. More than two-thirds of the population live in Clark County, which is coextensive with the <a>Las Vegas metropolitan area</a>. Thus, in terms of population, Nevada is one of the most centralized states in the nation.

</p>
<p>
<a>Henderson</a> and <a>North Las Vegas</a> are among the top 20 fastest-growing U.S. cities with populations over 100,000. The rural community of <a>Mesquite</a> 65 miles (105 km) northeast of Las Vegas was an example of micropolitan growth in the 1990s and 2000s. Other desert towns like <a>Indian Springs</a> and <a>Searchlight</a> on the outskirts of Las Vegas have seen some growth as well.

</p>
<p>
Since 1950, the rate of population born in Nevada has never peaked above 27 percent, the lowest rate of all states. In 2012, only 25% of Nevadans were born in Nevada.<sup><a href="#ref_46">[46]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
According to the 2017 <a>American Community Survey</a>, 28.2% of Nevada's population were of <a>Hispanic or Latino</a> origin (of any race): <a>Mexican</a> (21.4%), <a>Puerto Rican</a> (0.9%), <a>Cuban</a> (1.0%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (4.8%).<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup> The five largest non-Hispanic White ancestry groups were: <a>German</a> (11.3%), <a>Irish</a> (9.0%), <a>English</a> (6.9%), <a>Italian</a> (5.8%), and <a>American</a> (4.7%).<sup><a href="#ref_47">[47]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1980, non-Hispanic whites made up 83.3% of the state's population.<sup><a href="#ref_48">[48]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As of 2011, 63.6% of Nevada's population younger than age<span></span>1 were minorities.<sup><a href="#ref_52">[52]</a></sup> Las Vegas is a <a>majority-minority</a> city. According to the United States Census Bureau estimates, as of July 1, 2018, non-Hispanic Whites made up 48.7% of Nevada's population.<sup><a href="#ref_53">[53]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In <a>Douglas</a>, <a>Mineral</a>, and <a>Pershing</a> counties, a plurality of residents are of Mexican ancestry. In <a>Nye County</a> and <a>Humboldt County</a>, residents are mostly of German ancestry; <a>Washoe County</a> has many Irish Americans. Americans of English descent form pluralities in <a>Lincoln County</a>, <a>Churchill County</a>, <a>Lyon County</a>, <a>White Pine County</a>, and <a>Eureka County</a>.

</p>
<p>
Asian Americans lived in the state since the California Gold Rush of the 1850s brought thousands of Chinese miners to Washoe county. They were followed by a few hundred <a>Japanese</a> farmworkers in the late 19th century. By the late 20th century, many immigrants from <a>China</a>, <a>Japan</a>, Korea, the <a>Philippines</a>, <a>Bangladesh</a>, India, and <a>Vietnam</a> came to the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The city now has one of America's most prolific Asian American communities, with a mostly Chinese and <a>Taiwanese</a> area known as "<a>Chinatown</a>" west of I-15 on Spring Mountain Road. <a>Filipino Americans</a> form the largest Asian American group in the state, with a population of more than 113,000. They comprise 56.5% of the Asian American population in Nevada and constitute about 4.3% of the entire state's population.<sup><a href="#ref_54">[54]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Mining booms drew many Greek and Eastern European immigrants to Nevada.<sup><a href="#ref_55">[55]</a></sup> In the early twentieth century, <a>Greeks</a>, <a>Slavs</a>, <a>Danes</a>, <a>Japanese</a>, <a>Italians</a>, and <a>Basques</a> poured into Nevada.<sup><a href="#ref_56">[56]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Native American tribes in Nevada are the <a>Northern</a> and <a>Southern Paiute</a>, <a>Western Shoshone</a>, <a>Goshute</a>, <a>Hualapai</a>, <a>Washoe</a>, and <a>Ute</a> tribes.<sup><a href="#ref_57">[57]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The top countries of origin for immigrants in Nevada were Mexico (39.5 percent of immigrants), the Philippines (14.3 percent), El Salvador (5.2 percent), China (3.1 percent), and Cuba (3 percent).<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup>

<p>
A small percentage of Nevada's population lives in rural areas. The culture of these places differs significantly from major metropolitan areas. People in these rural counties tend to be native Nevada residents, unlike in the Las Vegas and Reno areas, where the vast majority of the population was born in another state. The rural population is also less diverse in terms of race and ethnicity. Mining plays an important role in the economies of the rural counties, with tourism being less prominent.<sup><a href="#ref_66">[66]</a></sup> Ranching also has a long tradition in rural Nevada.<sup><a href="#ref_67">[67]</a></sup>

The economy of Nevada is tied to tourism (especially entertainment and gambling related), mining, and cattle ranching. Nevada's industrial outputs are tourism, entertainment, mining, machinery, printing and publishing, food processing, and electric equipment. The Bureau of Economic Analysis<sup><a href="#ref_75">[75]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_76">[76]</a></sup> estimates Nevada's total state product in 2018 was $170<span></span>billion.<sup><a href="#ref_77">[77]</a></sup> The state's <a>per capita personal income</a> in 2020 was $53,635, ranking 31st in the nation.<sup><a href="#ref_78">[78]</a></sup> Nevada's state debt in 2012 was calculated to be $7.5<span></span>billion, or $3,100 per taxpayer.<sup><a href="#ref_79">[79]</a></sup> As of May 2021, the state's unemployment rate was 7.8%.<sup><a href="#ref_80">[80]</a></sup>

<p>
In portions of the state outside of the Las Vegas and Reno metropolitan areas mining plays a major economic role. By value, gold is by far the most important mineral mined. In 2004, 6,800,000 ounces (190,000,000 g) of gold worth $2.84<span></span>billion were mined in Nevada, and the state accounted for 8.7% of world gold production. Silver is a distant second, with 10,300,000 ounces (290,000,000 g) worth $69<span></span>million mined in 2004.<sup><a href="#ref_81">[81]</a></sup> Other minerals mined in Nevada include construction aggregates, copper, gypsum, diatomite and lithium. Despite its rich deposits, the cost of mining in Nevada is generally high, and output is very sensitive to world commodity prices.

</p>
<h3 id="Cattle_ranching">Cattle ranching</h3>
<p>
Cattle ranching is a major economic activity in rural Nevada. Nevada's agricultural outputs are cattle, hay, alfalfa, dairy products, onions, and potatoes. As of January 1, 2006, there were an estimated 500,000 head of cattle and 70,000 head of sheep in Nevada.<sup><a href="#ref_82">[82]</a></sup> Most of these animals forage on <a>rangeland</a> in the summer, with supplemental feed in the winter. Calves are generally shipped to out-of-state <a>feedlots</a> in the fall to be fattened for the market. Over 90% of Nevada's 484,000 acres (196,000 ha) of cropland is used to grow <a>hay</a>, mostly alfalfa, for livestock feed. This livestock is usually used for food.

<a>Amtrak</a>'s <i><a>California Zephyr</a></i> train uses the Union Pacific's original <a>transcontinental railroad</a> line in daily service from Chicago to <a>Emeryville, California</a>, serving <a>Elko</a>, <a>Winnemucca</a>, and Reno. Las Vegas has had no passenger train service since Amtrak's <a>Desert Wind</a> was discontinued in 1997. <a>Amtrak Thruway Motorcoaches</a> provide connecting service from Las Vegas to trains at <a>Needles, California</a>, Los Angeles, and <a>Bakersfield, California</a>; and from <a>Stateline, Nevada</a>, to <a>Sacramento, California</a>. There have been a number of proposals to re-introduce service to either <a>Los Angeles</a> or <a>Southern California</a>.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Union Pacific Railroad</a> has some railroads in the north and south of Nevada. <a>Greyhound Lines</a> provide some bus service to the state.

</p>
<p>
<a>Interstate 15</a> (I-15) passes through the southern tip of the state, serving Las Vegas and other communities. <a>I-215</a> and <a>I-515</a> also serve the Las Vegas metropolitan area. <a>I-80</a> crosses through the northern part of Nevada, roughly following the path of the Humboldt River from Utah in the east and the Truckee River westward through Reno into California. It has a spur route, <a>I-580</a>. Nevada also is served by several U.S. highways: <a>US<span></span>6</a>, <a>US<span></span>50</a>, <a>US<span></span>93</a>, <a>US<span></span>95</a> and <a>US<span></span>395</a>. There are also 189 <a>Nevada state routes</a>. Many of Nevada's counties have a system of county routes as well, though many are not signed or paved in rural areas. Nevada is one of a few states in the U.S. that do not have a continuous <a>interstate highway</a> linking its two major population centers – the road connection between the Las Vegas and Reno areas is a combination of several different Interstate and U.S. highways. The <a>Interstate 11</a> proposed routing may eventually remedy this.

</p>
<p>
The state is one of just a few in the country to allow <a>semi-trailer trucks</a> with three trailers – what might be called a "<a>road train</a>" in Australia. But American versions are usually smaller, in part because they must ascend and descend some fairly steep mountain passes.

</p>
<p>
<a>RTC Transit</a> is the public transit system in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The agency is the largest transit agency in the state and operates a network of bus service across the <a>Las Vegas Valley</a>, including the use of <a>The Deuce</a>, <a>double-decker buses</a>, on the <a>Las Vegas Strip</a> and several outlying routes. RTC RIDE operates a system of local transit bus service throughout the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area. Other transit systems in the state include Carson City's JAC. Most other counties in the state do not have public transportation at all.

</p>
<p>
Additionally, a 4-mile (6.4 km) <a>monorail</a> system provides public transportation in the Las Vegas area. The <a>Las Vegas Monorail</a> line services several casino properties and the <a>Las Vegas Convention Center</a> on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip, running near Paradise Road, with a possible future extension to <a>Harry Reid International Airport</a>. Several hotels also run their own monorail lines between each other, which are typically several blocks in length.

</p>
<p>
Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas is the busiest airport serving Nevada. The <a>Reno-Tahoe International Airport</a> (formerly known as the Reno Cannon International Airport) is the other major airport in the state.

<p>
Nevada has had a thriving solar energy sector. An independent study in 2013 concluded that solar users created a $36<span></span>million net benefit. However, in December 2015, the Public Utility Commission let the state's only power company, NV Energy, charge higher rates and fees to solar panel users, leading to an immediate collapse of rooftop solar panel use.<sup><a href="#ref_84">[84]</a></sup>

In December 1987, Congress amended the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to designate <a>Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a> as the only site to be characterized as a permanent repository for all of the nation's <a>highly radioactive waste</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_85">[85]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Affordable_Housing">Affordable Housing</h3>
<p>
Over the last six years, the <a>National Low Income Housing Coalition</a> calculates the discrepancy between available affordable housing units and renters who earn below the poverty line. In Nevada, only 15 affordable rental homes are available per 100 extremely low income (ELI) households.<sup><a href="#ref_86">[86]</a></sup> The shortage extends to a deficit in supply of 71,358 affordable rental homes. This is the largest discrepancy of any state. The most notable catalyst for this shortage is The <a>Great Recession</a> and Housing Crisis of 2007 and 2008. Since then, housing prices have increased while demand has increased, and supply has struggled to match the increase in demand. In addition to this, low-income service workers are slowly being pushed out by an influx of tech professionals. In Nevada there is essentially a standard of six-figure income to affordably rent a <a>single-family home</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_87">[87]</a></sup> Considering the <a>average salary</a> in Nevada, $54,842 per year, this standard is on average, unaffordable.<sup><a href="#ref_88">[88]</a></sup> The disproportionate cost of housing compared to average salary has led to 112,872 renters to be paying more than half of their yearly income towards housing.<sup><a href="#ref_89">[89]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The definition of an affordable home is “one that a household can obtain for <a>30 percent or less of its annual income</a>”. So, there is clearly a long way to go in order to close the gap between housing prices and relative income in within the state. Renters are looking for solutions to still be able to live in the state in a way that their income can support. As a result, single adults are being forced to split rent with other renters or move residences to farther outside metro areas. One solution being offered is to increase the supply of higher income positions within the state to make things more affordable. However, this would require Nevadans to retrain in new jobs or careers.

<h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
<p>
Education in Nevada is achieved through public and private <a>elementary</a>, <a>middle</a>, and <a>high schools</a>, as well as colleges and universities.

</p>
<p>
A May 2015 educational reform law expanded school choice options to 450,000 Nevada students who are at up to 185% of the <a>federal poverty level</a>. Education savings accounts (ESAs) are enabled by the new law to help pay the tuition for private schools. Alternatively, families "can use funds in these accounts to also pay for textbooks and tutoring".<sup><a href="#ref_90">[90]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_91">[91]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Approximately 86.9% of Nevada residents have attained at least a high school degree or equivalent, which is below the national average of 88.6%.<sup><a href="#ref_92">[92]</a></sup>

<p>
Under the <a>Constitution of the State of Nevada</a>, the powers of the <a>Nevada government</a> are divided among three <a>separate departments</a>: the <a>executive</a> consisting of the <a>governor of Nevada</a> and their cabinet along with the other elected constitutional officers; the <a>legislative</a> consisting of the <a>Nevada Legislature</a>, which includes the <a>Assembly</a> and the <a>Senate</a>; and the <a>judicial</a> consisting of the <a>Supreme Court of Nevada</a> and lower courts.

</p>
<p>
The governor is the <a>chief magistrate</a> of Nevada,<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> the head of the executive department of the state's government,<sup><a href="#ref_94">[94]</a></sup> and the commander-in-chief of the <a>state</a>'s <a>military forces</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_95">[95]</a></sup> The current governor is <a>Steve Sisolak</a>, a Democrat.

</p>
<p>
The Nevada Legislature is a <a>bicameral</a> body divided into an Assembly and Senate. Members of the Assembly serve two years, and members of the Senate serve four years. Both houses of the Nevada Legislature will be impacted by term limits starting in 2010, as senators and assemblymen/women will be limited to a maximum of twelve years in each house (by appointment or election which is a lifetime limit) – a provision of the constitution which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court of Nevada in a unanimous decision. Each session of the legislature meets for a constitutionally mandated 120 days in every odd-numbered year, or longer if the governor calls a special session.

</p>
<p>
On December 18, 2018, Nevada became the first in the United States with a female majority in its legislature. Women hold nine of the 21 seats in the Nevada Senate, and 23 of the 42 seats in the Nevada Assembly.<sup><a href="#ref_96">[96]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court of Nevada is the <a>state supreme court</a> and the head of the <a>Nevada Judiciary</a>. Original jurisdiction is divided between the <a>district courts</a> (with general jurisdiction), and justice courts and municipal courts (both of limited jurisdiction). Appeals from District Courts are made directly to the Nevada Supreme Court, which under a deflective model of jurisdiction, has the discretion to send cases to the <a>Court of Appeals</a> for final resolution.<sup><a href="#ref_97">[97]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Incorporated towns</a> in Nevada, known as cities, are given the authority to legislate anything not prohibited by law. A recent movement has begun to permit <a>home rule</a> to incorporate Nevada cities to give them more flexibility and fewer restrictions from the Legislature. Town Boards for <a>unincorporated towns</a> are limited local governments created by either the local county commission, or by referendum, and form a purely advisory role and in no way diminish the responsibilities of the county commission that creates them.

<p>
In 1900, Nevada's population was the smallest of all states and was shrinking, as the difficulties of living in a "barren desert" began to outweigh the lure of silver for many early settlers. Historian <a>Lawrence Friedman</a> has explained what happened next:

</p>
<p>
With the advent of <a>air conditioning</a> for summertime use and Southern Nevada's mild winters, the fortunes of the state began to turn around, as it did for <a>Arizona</a>, making these two states the fastest growing in the Union.

</p>
<div>See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_in_Nevada">Prostitution in Nevada</a></div>
<p>
Nevada is the only state where <a>prostitution</a> is legal – in a licensed <a>brothel</a> in a county which has specifically voted to permit it. It is illegal in larger jurisdictions such as Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), <a>Washoe County</a> (which contains Reno), and the independent city of <a>Carson City</a>.

</p>
<p>
Nevada's early reputation as a "divorce haven" arose from the fact that before the <a>no-fault divorce</a> revolution in the 1970s, divorces were difficult to obtain in the United States. Already having legalized gambling and prostitution, Nevada continued the trend of boosting its profile by adopting one of the most liberal divorce statutes in the nation. This resulted in <i><a>Williams v. North Carolina (1942)</a></i>, <a>317</a><a>U.S.</a><a>287</a>   (1942), in which the <a>U.S. Supreme Court</a> ruled <a>North Carolina</a> had to give "<a>full faith and credit</a>" to a Nevada divorce. The Court modified its decision in <i>Williams v. North Carolina</i> (1945), <a>325</a><a>U.S.</a><a>226</a>   (1945), by holding a state need not recognize a Nevada divorce unless one of the parties was domiciled there at the time the divorce was granted and the forum state was entitled to make its own determination.

</p>
<p>
As of 2009, Nevada's divorce rate was above the national average.<sup><a href="#ref_99">[99]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nevada's tax laws are intended to draw new residents and businesses to the state. Nevada has no <a>personal income tax</a> or <a>corporate income tax</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_100">[100]</a></sup> Since Nevada does not collect income data it cannot share such information with the federal government, the <a>IRS</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_101">[101]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state <a>sales tax</a> (similar to VAT or GST) in Nevada is variable depending upon the county. The statewide tax rate is 6.85%, with five counties (Elko, Esmeralda, Eureka, Humboldt, and Mineral) charging this amount. Counties may impose additional rates via voter approval or through approval of the state legislature; therefore, the applicable sales tax varies by county from 6.85% to 8.375% (Clark County). Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, imposes four separate county <a>option taxes</a> in addition to the statewide rate: 0.25% for flood control, 0.50% for mass transit, 0.25% for infrastructure, and 0.25% for more cops. In Washoe County, which includes Reno, the sales tax rate is 7.725%, due to county option rates for flood control, the ReTRAC train trench project, and mass transit, and an additional county rate approved under the Local Government Tax Act of 1991.<sup><a href="#ref_102">[102]</a></sup> The minimum Nevada sales tax rate changed on July 1, 2009.<sup><a href="#ref_103">[103]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The lodging tax rate in unincorporated Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas Strip, is 12%. Within the boundaries of the cities of Las Vegas and Henderson, the lodging tax rate is 13%.

</p>
<p>
Nevada provides a friendly environment for the formation of corporations, and many (especially California) businesses have incorporated in Nevada to take advantage of the benefits of the Nevada statute. <a>Nevada corporations</a> offer great flexibility to the board of directors and simplify or avoid many of the rules that are cumbersome to business managers in some other states. In addition, Nevada has no <a>franchise tax</a>, although it does require businesses to have a license for which the business has to pay the state.

</p>
<p>
Similarly, many U.S. states have <a>usury</a> laws limiting the amount of <a>interest</a> a lender can charge, but federal law allows corporations to 'import' these laws from their home state.

Nevada has very liberal <a>alcohol</a> laws. Bars are permitted to remain open 24<span></span>hours, with no "<a>last call</a>". <a>Liquor stores</a>, <a>convenience stores</a> and supermarkets may also sell alcohol 24<span></span>hours per day and may sell beer, wine and spirits.

</p>
<p>
In 2016, Nevada voters approved <a>Question<span></span>2</a>, which legalized the possession, transportation and cultivation of personal use amounts of <a>marijuana</a> for adults age 21 years and older, and authorized the creation of a regulated market for the sale of marijuana to adults age 21 years and older through state-licensed retail outlets.<sup><a href="#ref_105">[105]</a></sup> Nevada voters had previously approved <a>medical marijuana</a> in 2000, but rejected marijuana legalization in a similar referendum in 2006. Marijuana in all forms remains illegal under federal law.

</p>
<p>
Aside from cannabis legalization, non-alcohol drug laws are a notable exception to Nevada's otherwise libertarian principles. It is notable for having the harshest penalties for drug offenders in the country. Nevada remains the only state to still use <a>mandatory minimum sentencing</a> guidelines for possession of drugs.<sup><a href="#ref_106">[106]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The <a>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration</a> (SAMHSA) reported, in their Behavioral Health Barometer for Nevada, published in 2014, changes to substance abuse patterns and addiction across the southwestern state.<sup><a href="#ref_107">[107]</a></sup> Between 2012 and 2013, adolescents in Nevada abused illicit substances at a slightly higher percentage than nationally. 10.2 percent of Nevada's adolescents abused illicit drugs compared to 9.2 percent across the United States. Between 2009 and 2013, 11.7 percent of all adolescents in the state reported abusing illicit, intoxicating substances in the month prior to the survey; this represents 25,000 adolescents.

</p>
<p>
Nevada voters enacted a smoking ban ("The Nevada Clean Indoor Air Act") in November 2006 which became effective on December 8, 2006. It outlaws smoking in most workplaces and public places. Smoking is permitted in bars, but only if the bar serves no food, or the bar is inside a larger casino. Smoking is also permitted in casinos, certain hotel rooms, tobacco shops, and brothels.<sup><a href="#ref_108">[108]</a></sup> However, some businesses do not obey this law and the government tends not to enforce it.<sup><a href="#ref_109">[109]</a></sup> In 2011, smoking restrictions in Nevada were relaxed for certain places which allow only people 21 or older inside.<sup><a href="#ref_110">[110]</a></sup>

In 2006, the <a>crime rate</a> in Nevada was about 24% higher than the national average rate, though crime has since decreased. <a>Property crimes</a> accounted for about 85% of the total crime rate in Nevada, which was 21% higher than the national rate.

<p>
Due to heavy growth in the southern portion of the state, there is a noticeable divide between the politics of northern and southern Nevada. Historically, northern Nevada has been very <a>Republican</a>. The more rural counties of the north are among the most conservative regions of the country. Carson City, the state's capital, is a Republican-leaning swing city/county. Washoe County, home to Reno, has historically been strongly Republican, but now has become more of a Democratic-leaning swing county, like the state as a whole. Clark County, home to Las Vegas, has been a stronghold for the Democratic Party since it was founded in 1909, having voted Republican only six times and once for a third-party candidate. Clark and Washoe counties have long dominated the state's politics. Between them, they cast 87 percent of Nevada's vote, and elect a substantial majority of the state legislature. The last Republican to carry Clark County was <a>George H.W. Bush</a> in 1988, and the last Republican to carry Washoe County was <a>George W. Bush</a> in 2004. The great majority of the state's elected officials are from either Las Vegas or Reno.

</p>
<p>
However, in 2014, Republican <a>Adam Laxalt</a>, despite losing both Clark and Washoe counties, was elected <a>Attorney General</a>. However, he had lost Clark County only by 5.6% and Washoe County by 1.4%, attributable to lower turnout in these counties.<sup><a href="#ref_114">[114]</a></sup>

This gives the state status as a political <a>bellwether</a>. From 1912 to 2020, Nevada has been carried by the presidential victor the most out of any state (27 of 29 elections). In 2016, Nevada lost its bellwether status briefly when it narrowly cast its votes for <a>Hillary Clinton</a>. Nevada regained it when Biden won in 2020. Nevada has been carried by the winner of nearly every presidential election since its first in 1864, only being carried by the defeated candidate eight times since statehood. It was one of only three states won by <a>John F. Kennedy</a> in <a>the American West</a> in the election of <a>1960</a>, albeit narrowly.<sup><a href="#ref_115">[115]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Hillary Clinton narrowly defeated Trump in Nevada in <a>2016</a>, winning 47.92% of votes to Trump's 45.5%.<sup><a href="#ref_116">[116]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The state's U.S. Senators are Democrats <a>Catherine Cortez Masto</a> and <a>Jacky Rosen</a>. The Governorship is held by <a>Steve Sisolak</a>, a Democrat.

Nevada is the only U.S. state to have a <a>none of the above</a> option available on its ballots. Officially called <a>None of These Candidates</a>, the option was first added to the ballot in 1975 and is used in all statewide elections, including president, US Senate and all state constitutional positions. In the event "None of These Candidates" receives a <a>plurality</a> of votes in the election, the candidate with the next-highest total is elected.<sup><a href="#ref_117">[117]</a></sup>

Resort areas like Las Vegas, Reno, Lake Tahoe, and <a>Laughlin</a> attract visitors from around the nation and world. In FY08 their 266 casinos (not counting ones with annual revenue under a million dollars) brought in $12<span></span><i>billion</i> in gaming revenue and another $13<span></span>billion in non-gaming revenue. A review of gaming statistics can be found at <a>Nevada gaming area</a>.

</p>
<p>
Nevada has by far the most hotel rooms per capita in the United States. According to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, there were 187,301 rooms in 584 hotels (of 15 or more rooms). The state is ranked just below California, Texas, Florida, and New York in the total number of rooms, but those states have much larger populations. Nevada has one hotel room for every 14 residents, far above the national average of one hotel room per 67 residents.<sup><a href="#ref_118">[118]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Prostitution is legal in parts of Nevada</a> in licensed brothels, but only counties with populations under 400,000 have the option to legalize it. Although prostitution is not a major part of the Nevada economy, employing roughly 300 women as independent contractors, it is a very visible endeavor. Of the 14 counties permitted to legalize prostitution under state law, eight have chosen to legalize brothels. State law prohibits prostitution in Clark County (which contains Las Vegas), and Washoe County (which contains Reno). However, prostitution is legal in Storey County, which is part of the <a>Reno–Sparks metropolitan area</a>.

The Las Vegas Valley is home to the <a>Vegas Golden Knights</a> of the <a>National Hockey League</a> who began to play in the <a>2017–18 NHL season</a> at <a>T-Mobile Arena</a> on the Las Vegas Strip in <a>Paradise, Nevada</a>, the <a>Las Vegas Raiders</a> of the <a>National Football League</a> who began play at <a>Allegiant Stadium</a> in Las Vegas in 2020 after <a>moving from Oakland, California</a>, and the <a>Las Vegas Aces</a> of the <a>WNBA</a> who began playing in 2018 at <a>Mandalay Bay Events Center</a> after relocating from <a>San Antonio</a>.

<p>
Nevada takes pride in college sports, most notably its college football. College teams in the state include the <a>Nevada Wolf Pack</a> (representing the University of Nevada, Reno) and the <a>UNLV Rebels</a> (representing the University of Nevada, Las Vegas), both in the <a>Mountain West Conference</a> (MW).

</p>
<p>
UNLV is most remembered for <a>its men's basketball program</a>, which experienced its height of supremacy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Coached by <a>Jerry Tarkanian</a>, the Runnin' Rebels became one of the most elite programs in the country. In 1990, <a>UNLV</a> won the Men's Division<span></span>I Championship by defeating <a>Duke</a> 103–73, which set tournament records for most points scored by a team and largest margin of victory in the national title game.

</p>
<p>
In <a>1991</a>, UNLV finished the regular season undefeated, a feat that would not be matched in Division<span></span>I men's basketball for <a>more than 20 years</a>. Forward <a>Larry Johnson</a> won several awards, including the <a>Naismith Award</a>. UNLV reached the Final Four yet again, but lost their national semifinal against <a>Duke</a> 79–77. The Runnin' Rebels were the <a>Associated Press</a> pre-season No.<span></span>1 back to back (1989–90, 1990–91). <a>North Carolina</a> is the only other team to accomplish that (2007–08, 2008–09).

</p>
<p>
The state's involvement in major-college sports is not limited to its local schools. In the 21st century, the Las Vegas area has become a significant regional center for college basketball conference tournaments. The MW, <a>West Coast Conference</a>, and <a>Western Athletic Conference</a> all hold their men's and women's tournaments in the area, and the Pac-12 holds its men's tournament there as well. The <a>Big Sky Conference</a>, after decades of holding its men's and women's conference tournaments at campus sites, began holding both tournaments in Reno in 2016.

</p>
<p>
Las Vegas has hosted several <a>professional boxing</a> matches, most recently at the <a>MGM Grand Garden Arena</a> with bouts such as <a>Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield</a>, <a>Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II</a>, <a>Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather</a> and <a>Oscar De La Hoya vs. Manny Pacquiao</a> and at the newer <a>T-Mobile Arena</a> with <a>Canelo Álvarez vs. Amir Khan</a>.

</p>
<p>
Along with significant rises in popularity in <a>mixed martial arts</a> (MMA), a number of fight leagues such as the <a>UFC</a> have taken interest in Las Vegas as a primary event location due to the number of suitable host venues. The <a>Mandalay Bay Events Center</a> and <a>MGM Grand Garden Arena</a> are among some of the more popular venues for fighting events such as MMA and have hosted several UFC and other MMA title fights. The city has held the most UFC events with 86 events.

</p>
<p>
The state is also home to the <a>Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a>, which hosts <a>NASCAR</a>'s <a>Pennzoil 400</a> and <a>South Point 400</a>. Two venues in the immediate Las Vegas area host major annual events in <a>rodeo</a>. The <a>Thomas & Mack Center</a>, built for UNLV men's basketball, hosts the <a>National Finals Rodeo</a>. The PBR World Finals, operated by the bull riding-only <a>Professional Bull Riders</a>, was also held at the Thomas & Mack Center before moving to T-Mobile Arena in 2016.

</p>
<p>
The state is also home to famous tennis player, <a>Andre Agassi</a>, and current baseball superstar <a>Bryce Harper</a>.

<a>Area 51</a> is near <a>Groom Lake</a>, a dry salt lake bed. The much smaller <a>Creech Air Force Base</a> is in <a>Indian Springs, Nevada</a>; <a>Hawthorne Army Depot</a> in <a>Hawthorne</a>; the <a>Tonopah Test Range</a> near <a>Tonopah</a>; and <a>Nellis AFB</a> in the northeast part of the <a>Las Vegas Valley</a>. <a>Naval Air Station Fallon</a> in <a>Fallon</a>; NSAWC, (pronounced "EN-SOCK") in western Nevada. NSAWC consolidated three Command Centers into a single Command Structure under a flag officer on July 11, 1996. The Naval Strike Warfare Center (STRIKE "U") based at NAS Fallon since 1984, was joined with the Navy Fighter Weapons School (<a>TOPGUN</a>) and the Carrier Airborne Early Warning Weapons School (TOPDOME) which both moved from NAS Miramar as a result of a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decision in 1993 which transferred that installation back to the Marine Corps as MCAS Miramar. The Seahawk Weapon School was added in 1998 to provide tactical training for Navy helicopters.

</p>
<p>
These bases host a number of activities including the <a>Joint Unmanned Aerial Systems Center of Excellence</a>, the <a>Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center</a>, <a>Nevada Test and Training Range</a>, <a>Red Flag</a>, the <a>U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds</a>, the <a>United States Air Force Warfare Center</a>, the <a>United States Air Force Weapons School</a>, and the <a>United States Navy Fighter Weapons School</a>.

 The distinction of highest point in Nevada goes to the summit of Boundary Peak, so named because it is very near the Nevada–California border, at the northern terminus of the White Mountains. However, Boundary Peak can be considered a subsidiary summit of Montgomery Peak, whose summit is in California, since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topographic_prominence">topographic prominence</a> of Boundary Peak is only 253 feet (77 m), which falls under the often used 300-foot (91 m) cutoff for an independent peak. Also, Boundary Peak is less than 1 mile (1.6 km) away from its higher neighbor. Hence Boundary Peak can be described as not being wholly within Nevada. By contrast, the prominence of Wheeler Peak, 13,063 feet (3,982 m), is quite large and in fact it is the twelfth largest in the contiguous United States. Wheeler Peak is the highest point in a radius of more than 200 square miles (520 km<sup>2</sup>) and is entirely within the state of Nevada.
