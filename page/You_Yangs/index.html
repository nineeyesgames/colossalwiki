  <h1 id="You_Yangs">You Yangs</h1>
<p>
The <b>You Yangs</b> are a series of <a>granite</a><a>ridges</a>  that rise to 319 m (1,047 ft) above the flat and low-lying <a>Werribee Plain</a> in southern <a>Victoria</a>, <a>Australia</a>, approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) due west of the rural town of <a>Little River</a>, 55 km (34 mi) southwest of <a>Melbourne</a><a>CBD</a>  and 22 km (14 mi) northeast of <a>Geelong</a>. The main ridge runs roughly north-south for about 9 km (5.6 mi), with a lower extension running for about 15 km (9.3 mi) to the west. Much of the southern parts of the ranges are protected by the <a>You Yangs Regional Park</a>. It has said to have had many fatalities, one which was very recent, a young 25 year old male nicknamed “Buddy” from the Western Suburbs, was out hiking with his Partner where it was said he had slipped and fell 319m from Flinders Peak to his death. 

</p>
<p>
Although only 319 m at their highest (Flinders Peak), they dominate the surrounding landscape and are clearly identifiable from nearby Geelong, Melbourne and beyond. <a>Camping</a> is not permitted in the You Yangs. The foothills to the north of the peaks are home to <a>Ford Australia</a>'s <a>proving ground</a><sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> and <a>SSAA</a>'s Eagle Park <a>shooting range</a>.

</p>
<p>
The You Yangs are home to a <a>geoglyph</a> of <a>Bunjil</a>, a <a>Dreamtime</a> creator deity to some of the <a>Indigenous people of Victoria</a>, depicted as an <a>wedge-tailed eagle</a>. The geoglyph was constructed by the Australian artist <a>Andrew Rogers</a> in recognition of the local <a>Indigenous</a><a>Wathaurong</a>  people. Unveiled in March 2006, the geoglyph has a wing span of 100 metres and 1500 tonnes of rock was used in its construction.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>

<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
The name "You Yang" comes from the <a>Aboriginal</a> words <i><a>Wurdi Youang</a></i> or <i>Ude Youang</i> which could have any number of meanings from "big mountain in the middle of a plain", "big or large hill", or "bald". The <a>Woiwurrung</a> word for granite stone 'yow.wong' is also a possibility.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> The Yawangi people enlarged natural hollows in the rocks to form <a>wells</a> that held water even in dry seasons.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> The area around the You Yangs was called <i>Morong-morongoo</i> after the <a>murnong</a> that was abundant there in the past.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Explorer <a>Matthew Flinders</a> was the first European to visit the You Yangs. On 1 May 1802, he and three of his men climbed to the highest point.<sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup> He named it "Station Peak"<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> but the name was changed in 1912 to "Flinders Peak" in his honour.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The You Yangs have always attracted artists to paint them and feature most strongly in works by one of Australia's greatest artists, <a>Fred Williams</a>.  Williams spent long periods developing his <i><a>plein air</a></i> representations of the You Yangs, and these have now become classics of Australian art – rugged, dramatic, yet sparse in their imagery – unquestionably of the Australian bush.

</p>
<p>
The You Yangs were chosen to depict some battle scenes for the HBO WW2 series <i><a>The Pacific</a></i>.

Two watercourses pass through or by the ranges: <a>Hovells Creek</a> originates in the western parts of the ranges, while <a>Little River</a> flows around the ranges to the north and east.

<p>
Contrary to popular belief, the You Yangs are not the remains of a <a>volcano</a>. They are an <a>inselberg</a> or monadnock,<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> and the <a>granite</a> that forms them was originally a mass of <a>magma</a> that had worked its way up into the surrounding <a>sedimentary rocks</a> during the <a>Devonian</a> period, when the land surface in Victoria was several kilometres higher than today.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The magma <a>crystallised</a> before it reached the surface, so it did not produce any volcanic activity. Instead, a very slow cooling rate allowed many large white crystals of <a>feldspar</a> to form.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> These can be seen in many of the granite outcrops throughout the ranges. In places the crystals appear to be lined up, probably because the gooey magma was still moving around when they were growing. The rock enclosing the big feldspar crystals mainly contains crystals of greyish <a>quartz</a> and two black minerals (<a>hornblende</a> and a variety of <a>mica</a> known as <a>biotite</a>).

</p>
<p>
There are also some tiny crystals of two minerals, <a>allanite</a> and <a>titanite</a>, that contain <a>radioactive</a> elements such as <a>uranium</a> and <a>thorium</a>. Titanite crystals have been used to calculate that the You Yangs granite solidified 365 million years ago. In many places in the granite there are dark grey clots and lumps. These are called <a>xenoliths</a> and are foreign pieces of sedimentary rock that have been incorporated into the magma as it moved to the location at which it solidified.

</p>
<div class="thumb"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Werribee%2C_facing_the_You_Yangs_to_the_west._Taken_2017.jpg/220px-Werribee%2C_facing_the_You_Yangs_to_the_west._Taken_2017.jpg" alt="null"></div>
<p>
The land surface has <a>eroded</a> over the millions of years since the granite solidified, leaving it exposed. Because granite is a hard rock, it has resisted erosion better than the rocks that surrounded it. The size and shape of the rounded tors are controlled by fractures in the granite that resulted from slight shrinkage during cooling. Weathering and erosion of the granite has formed a blanket of sandy soil that covers any contacts with surrounding rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="Climate%2C_vegetation%20and%20wildlife">Climate, vegetation and wildlife</h2>
<p>
Owing to the <a>rain shadow</a> created by the <a>Otway Ranges</a> to the south west, the You Yangs are in the driest part of Victoria south of the <a>Great Dividing Range</a>. Annual rainfall is as little as 450 millimetres (18 in), with the result that the vegetation is <a>grassland</a> or low woodland rather than forest.

</p>
<p>
River red gum (<i><a>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</a></i>) is the dominant native tree on the low slopes and gullies, yellow gum (<i><a>E. leucoxylon</a></i>) grows widely throughout the low and middle slopes, and blue gum (<i><a>E. pseudoglobulus</a></i>) grows on the rugged upper slopes. Other native trees in the park include red box (<i><a>E. polyanthemos</a></i>), grey box (<i><a>E. microcarpa</a></i>) & yellow box (<i><a>E. melliodora</a></i>), manna gum (<i><a>E. viminalis</a></i>), red ironbark (<i><a>E. tricarpa</a></i>), cherry ballart (<i><a>Exocarpos cupressiformis</a></i>), and silver and black wattle (<i><a>Acacia dealbata</a></i> and <i><a>A.mearnsii</a></i>).  Native low vegetation is sparse and dominated by grasses and saltbushes, with some scrubby areas of snowy mintbush (<i><a>Prostanthera nivea</a></i>) and drooping cassinia (<i><a>Cassinia arcuata</a></i>).

</p>
<p>
Many introduced plants occur in the You Yangs, some planted deliberately for forestry, including sugar gum (<i><a>E. cladocalyx</a></i>), swamp yate (<i><a>E. occidentalis</a></i>) and brown mallet (<i><a>E. astringens</a></i>), and others that have been introduced accidentally or have invaded the area, for example, <a>boneseed</a> (<i><a>Chyrsanthemoides monilifera</a></i>) and bridal creeper (<i><a>Asparagus asparagoides</a></i>).

</p>
<p>
The You Yangs are home to more than 200 bird species such as <a>tawny frogmouths</a>, <a>white-naped</a>, <a>white-plumed</a>, <a>New Holland</a> and <a>brown-headed honeyeaters</a>, <a>kookaburras</a>, <a>white-winged choughs</a>, <a>crested shriketits</a>, <a>eastern rosellas</a>, <a>crimson rosellas</a>, <a>purple-crowned lorikeets</a>, <a>sulphur-crested cockatoos</a>, <a>eastern yellow robins</a>, <a>jacky winters</a> and <a>scarlet robins</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Mammals living in the park include <a>eastern grey kangaroos</a>, <a>echidnas</a>, <a>swamp wallabies</a>, <a>sugar gliders</a>, <a>brushtail</a> and <a>ringtail possums</a>, and <a>koalas</a>.

</p>
<p>
Koalas in the You Yangs have been studied since 2006. In approximately 28% of the Park they are monitored by a non-intrusive system of nose pattern identification.  The entire population was considered to number around 105 in 2017, down 35% from estimated 161 in 2007. The population has been recorded to prefer to roost in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis): 34% of sightings occur in that species. Four generations of one koala family have been recorded.<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The nearby <a>Serendip Sanctuary</a>, a Victorian government wildlife research centre, open to the public, has been involved in breeding endangered Victorian wildlife species, such as the <a>Australian bustard</a> and the <a>brolga</a> (<i>Antigone rubicundus</i>).<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
