<b>Medicine Hat</b> is a city in <a>southeast</a><a>Alberta</a> , Canada. It is located along the <a>South Saskatchewan River</a>. It is approximately 169 km (105 mi) east of <a>Lethbridge</a> and 295 km (183 mi) southeast of <a>Calgary</a>. This city and the adjacent Town of <a>Redcliff</a> to the northwest are within  <a>Cypress County</a>. Medicine Hat was the <a>sixth-largest city in Alberta</a> in 2016 with a population of 63,230.

</p>
<p>
Started as a railway town, today Medicine Hat is served by the <a>Trans-Canada Highway</a> (<a>Highway 1</a>) and the eastern terminus of the <a>Crowsnest Highway</a> (<a>Highway 3</a>).  Nearby communities considered part of the Medicine Hat area include the Town of Redcliff (abutting the city's northwest boundary) and the hamlets of <a>Desert Blume</a>, <a>Dunmore</a>, <a>Irvine</a>, <a>Seven Persons</a>, and <a>Veinerville</a>. The <a>Cypress Hills</a> (including <a>Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park</a>) is a relatively short distance (by car) to the southeast of the city.

</p>
<p>
Historically, Medicine Hat has been known for its large <a>natural gas</a> fields, being immortalized by <a>Rudyard Kipling</a> as having "all hell for a basement".<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup> Because of these reserves, the city is known as "The Gas City".

<p>
The name "Medicine Hat" is an English interpretation of <i>Saamis</i> (SA-MUS) – the <a>Blackfoot word</a> for the eagle tail feather headdress worn by <a>medicine men</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Several legends are associated with the name of a mythical <a>mer-man</a> river serpent named <i>Soy-yee-daa-bee</i> – the Creator – who appeared to a hunter and instructed him to sacrifice his wife to get mystical powers which were manifest in a special hat. Another legend tells of a battle long ago between the <a>Blackfoot</a> and the <a>Cree</a> in which a retreating Cree "Medicine Man" lost his headdress in the <a>South Saskatchewan River</a>.

</p>
<p>
A number of natural factors have always made Medicine Hat a gathering place. The gently sloping valley with its converging waterways and hardy native <a>cottonwood</a> trees attracted both the migratory <a>bison</a> herds which passed through the area, and humans who used the waterways and hunted the bison. Before Europeans arrived, the historic Blackfoot, Cree and <a>Assiniboine</a> nations used the area for hundreds of years, and were preceded for thousands of years by previous indigenous cultures.

</p>
<p>
Beginning in 1971, archeological excavations supervised by scholars from <a>Medicine Hat College</a> (MHC) were conducted at what became known as Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek, near a historic Blackfoot buffalo jump. These revealed numerous artifacts associated with bands of First Nations ancestors, known as the <a>Old Women's Phase</a> to archeologists. They found "quantities of stone tools, fire cracked rock, butchered bone and pottery", marking this as an important spot. Most of the bones were identified as bison. Additional excavations were conducted in 1972 and 1973, and a field school for college students was based there. They "excavated and mapped over 3,200 sq. ft. of living floors and nearly 80 features including hearths and stone boiling pits. Radiocarbon dates indicate the Saamis Site was initially occupied about AD 1500 and again around AD 1750",<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup> well before most European contact.

</p>
<p>
Also in this area, further to the west, other MHC students and faculty were part of an excavation in 2000 at what became known as the Hillside Campsite, where two layers of finds were made. The upper layer had artifacts from the Old Women's Phase, but the lower layers were found to be much older, containing <a>Pelican Lake Phase</a> remains that were dated to between 1000 and 1500 BC.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>
In 1883, when the <a>Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR) reached Medicine Hat and crossed the river, European Canadians established a town site. They named it from the <a>First Nations</a> legends. As growth took place, in 1889 Medicine Hat built the first hospital west of <a>Winnipeg</a>. The CPR established this town as a railway  <a>divisional point</a>. The frontier settlement was incorporated as a town on October 31, 1898, and as a city on May 9, 1906. Medicine Hat is halfway between Winnipeg and <a>Vancouver</a>, British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast.

</p>
<h3 id="Progress_and%20growth">Progress and growth</h3>
<p>
Rich in natural resources including natural gas, coal, clay, and farmland, the town became industrialized and was known in its early days as "the <a>Pittsburgh</a> of the West", referring to the industrial city in western Pennsylvania of the United States. A number of large industries located here, attracted by the cheap and plentiful energy resources. Coal mines, brick works, pottery and glass bottle manufacturing plants, flour mills, etc. became established. With transportation access via the railway and river, the town became a service and trade center for the agriculture and its products, both commodity crops and livestock, of the surrounding area. Between 1909–1914 the town had an economic boom that increased the population to more than 10,000. Little growth occurred between the World Wars.

</p>
<p>
During World War II, one of the largest <a>prisoner-of-war camps</a> (P.O.W.) in Canada was established here in the mid-1940s, used primarily to hold German and Italian prisoners. It was not until the 1950s of the post-war period that the town again had commercial growth.

</p>
<p>
In the 21st century, Medicine Hat promotes its quality of life and affordable cost of living, enjoying the savings of a city-owned gas utility and power generation plant. Major industries have included chemical plants, a <a>Goodyear</a> tire and rubber plant, greenhouses, numerous oil and gas related companies, a foundry, I-XL Industries (a brickworks dating from the 1880s),<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup> to name a few. Friends of Medalta is a non-profit that has been formed to preserve some of the city's industrial heritage.

<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
The Medicine Hat landscape is dominated by the South Saskatchewan River valley. In addition, the tributaries Seven Persons Creek and Ross Creek both flow into the South Saskatchewan River within the boundaries of the city. These waterways have cut a dramatic valley landscape with numerous cliffs, and finger <a>coulees</a> throughout the city. Beyond the city and river valley, the land is flat to slightly rolling and is characterized by short-grass vegetation.

<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<p>
Located in the <a>steppe</a> region known as <a>Palliser's Triangle</a>, Medicine Hat has a <a>semi-arid climate</a> (<a>Köppen climate classification</a><i><a>BSk</a></i> ), with cold winters, and warm to hot, dry summers. Frequently, the winter cold is ameliorated by mild and dry <a>Chinook winds</a> blowing from the west, and hot summer daytime <a>temperatures</a> are made more tolerable by low <a>humidity</a> and rapid cooling in the evening. As Medicine Hat receives less <a>precipitation</a> annually than most other cities on the <a>Canadian Prairies</a> and plentiful <a>sunshine</a> (it is widely known as "The sunniest city in Canada"),<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup> it is a popular retirement city. Maximum precipitation typically occurs in the late spring and early summer.

<p>
The Shannon House is a historical landmark built in 1906 by James Shannon for his wife and nine children. He had purchased the land and a team of horses for $40.00 in 1895. The family kept the property for three generations, using part of it as a campground in the early 20th century. In 1930, they built the Maple Leaf motel on the property to generate some income. In 1990 a local family bought the property. With a view toward keeping the prominent property as part of the community, they adapted it as the Saamis Memorial Funeral Chapel & Crematorium.

</p>
<p>
Now named the <i>Saamis Tepee</i>, this work of public art is the world's tallest <a>teepee</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_58">[58]</a></sup> It was installed in 1991 south of the Trans-Canada Highway and at the edge of the Blackfoot <a>buffalo jump</a>, above the Saamis Archeological Site along Seven Persons Creek. Commissioned for the <a>1988 Winter Olympics</a> in <a>Calgary</a> as a symbol of Canada's Plains Indians, it stood 215 ft (66 m) high (more than 20 storeys) and is 160 ft (49 m) in diameter at the base. The sculpture was designed by Steve Illes of steel and concrete. He had the teepee painted "white for purity, red for the rising and setting sun, and blue for flowing waters". Within the teepee are ten circles, with painted illustrations that express ideas about the cultures of the Plains tribes. Explanation are on plaques set in the base.<sup><a href="#ref_59">[59]</a></sup> Although designed to withstand extreme temperatures and winds up to 240 km/h (150 mph), during a severe windstorm in January 2007, a portion of the teepee was damaged. Inspection revealed that extensive weathering had weakened the structure. The necessary repairs resulted in lowering the height of Saamis Teepee by approximately 15 ft (4.6 m).
