<b>Nugget Point</b> (<a>Māori</a>: <i>Tokatā</i>) is one of the most iconic landforms on the <a>Otago</a> coast. Located at the northern end of <a>the Catlins coast</a>, along the road from <a>Kaka Point</a>, this steep headland has a lighthouse at its tip, surrounded by rocky islets (<b>The Nuggets</b>). The point is home to many seabirds, including <a>penguins</a>, <a>gannets</a> and <a>royal spoonbills</a>, and a large breeding colony of <a>fur seals</a>. Roaring Bay, on the south coast of the tip of Nugget Point, is home to a small colony of <a>yellow-eyed penguins</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Nugget_Point%20Lighthouse">Nugget Point Lighthouse</h2>
<div>Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nugget_Point_Lighthouse">Nugget Point Lighthouse</a></div>
<p>
Nugget Point had been considered a significant danger in particular to small vessels trading along the coast to the <a>Clutha River</a>. The lighthouse was built in 1869 and started operating on 4 July 1870.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>  The tower was constructed from locally quarried stone and stands 76 metres (249 ft) above the water.  Originally powered by an oil burner, it was converted to a 1000 W lamp in 1949 with electricity provided by a diesel generator until the 1960s, when the lighthouse was connected to mains electricity.  It was automated in 1989 and is computer-monitored and operated by <a>Maritime New Zealand</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>

<h2 id="Proposed_marine%20reserve">Proposed marine reserve</h2>
<p>
Although the headland itself is a 47 hectares (120 acres) scientific reserve, the marine area around it currently has no special protection. While a <a>marine reserve</a> has been proposed twice by the <a>New Zealand Department of Conservation</a>, this has proved controversial. Many of the small local communities, which still rely on fishing for their livelihood, have been a source of opposition to the proposed reserve. Fishing industry bodies such as the Seafood Industry Council have also argued against it.
Meanwhile, many <a>University of Otago</a> scientists support a reserve. The initial proposal would have protected more coastline than the latest Department of Conservation proposal, which covers only about one third of the coastline that the <a>Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society</a> has proposed protecting, to less than one tenth the distance offshore.

<h2 id="Tourism">Tourism</h2>
<p>
Nugget Point is advertised as a side trip from the <a>Southern Scenic Route</a>, with the main attractions being two easy 20-minute return walks, one to the viewing platform next to the lighthouse, the other to Roaring Bay.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The closest village is Kaka Point, which has traveller accommodation.  The Nuggets Road is sealed for its entirety<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup> and climbs the bluff towards two car parks at Nugget Point.  The walk to Roaring Bay starts at the lower car park and leads to a <a>bird hide</a>.  Yellow-eyed penguins may be observed here, as well as fur seals and sometimes <a>sea lions</a> and <a>elephant seals</a><sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> (one of few places in the nation with regular occurrences of this species). Cetaceans such as migrating <a>southern right whales</a><sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup> and <a>humpback whales</a>, <a>orca</a>, and dolphins such as endemic <a>Hector's dolphins</a> can be seen from the shore.
