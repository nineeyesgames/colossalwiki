<p>
<b>Mount Arapiles</b> is a rock formation that rises about 140 metres (460 ft) above the <a>Wimmera</a> plains in western <a>Victoria</a>, <a>Australia</a>. It is located in <a>Arapiles</a> approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) west of the town  of <a>Natimuk</a> and is part of the <a>Mount Arapiles-Tooan State Park</a>. Arapiles is a very popular destination for <a>rock climbers</a> due to the quantity and quality of climbs. It is one of the premier climbing sites in Australia along with the nearby <a>Grampians</a>. The <a>Wotjobaluk</a> name for the formation is <i><b>Djurid</b></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>
The Djurid Baluk clan of the <a>Wotjobaluk people</a> inhabited the nearby area for thousands of years prior to the European colonisation of Australia. They used the mountain's hard sandstone for making various stone tools, and found shelter in its many gullies and small caves. Following European settlement in the mid-1840s, the Djurid Balud were displaced from the area, leading to the breaking up of the clan. The loss of the resources that the mountain provided, the ravages of European disease, and armed clashes with the settlers were all contributing factors. By the early 1870s, the last of the Djurid Balud had been relocated to mission stations. Some of their descendants still live in the area and there are also a number of archaeological sites nearby. Indeed, a survey of Mount Arapiles in 1992 located no fewer than 42 Aboriginal archaeological sites, including "quarries" for hard stone for implements, scarred trees and rock art sites.

</p>
<p>
The European colonisation of Australia also brought with it many explorers to chart the continent. The first recorded ascent of Arapiles was on 23 July 1836, by the European explorer, <a>Major Thomas Mitchell</a>. He named the landmark after the Arapiles hills near <a>Salamanca</a>, <a>Spain</a>, where the <a>Battle of Salamanca</a> took place, in which Mitchell had seen action.

</p>
<p>
An extract from Mitchell's diary on 22 July reads:

</p>
<p>
There is a plaque commemorating his contributions to Arapiles on the aptly named "Plaque Rock", which is close to the current campgrounds.

</p>
<h2 id="Geology">Geology</h2>
<p>
Mount Arapiles is primarily composed of <a>quartzite</a>, a <a>metamorphic rock</a> that was originally quartzose <a>conglomerate</a> and <a>sandstone</a> (quartz arenite). That <a>protolith</a> was laid down in the earliest part of the <a>Devonian</a> period (approx 420 Ma), as part of a substantial <a>fluvial system</a>. Evidence for that deposition can be seen in the decimeter-meter scale cross <a>stratification</a> and lateral accretion surfaces visible in the cliffs, and the presence of many beds containing well rounded, pebble size <a>clasts</a>. The nearby <a>Grampians/Gariwerd</a> mountain range contains some more distal <a>facies</a> of the same depositonal system, which is evidenced by the lesser quantity of conglomerate and smaller average grain size.

</p>
<p>
Arapiles is preserved due to a granitic intrusion that was emplaced below the sandstone and conglomerate approx 400 Ma, or 20 million years after sedimentation. That intrusion advected heat from lower in the crust, facilitating pervasive quartz <a>cementation</a> of the detrital grains. The granite also contained some highly <a>siliceous</a> fluids that were driven off as the rock cooled. Those fluids probably also contributed to the cementation of the sediments. The process of direct heating due to <a>magma</a> transport is known as contact metamorphism.

</p>
<p>
Although the unmetamorphosed, but otherwise similar, sediments surrounding "the Mount" have eroded away, Arapiles has been preserved, because the total occulsion of pore space related to the cementation helps to limit erosion.

</p>
<p>
The rock has a distinct red/orange tinge that is due to trace amounts of <a>iron oxide</a> and various other impurities.

<p>
Although there are many hiking routes to the top (including one resembling a <a>via ferrata</a>), most ascentionists choose to free climb one of the thousands of vertical routes on the mountain. Since the advent of modern rock climbing, thousands of routes have been recorded.

<p>
Arapiles was first considered for climbing in a recreational manner in September 1963, when Bob and Steve Craddock travelled to <a>Mitre Rock</a> after seeing it in a tourist guide, and saw that their destination was dwarfed by Mount Arapiles. It was a number of weeks and visits before climbing was actually attempted at Arapiles, with the first climbs being recorded in November 1963 on what is now called "The Pinnacle Face". The pioneering group, consisting of the Craddocks, Doug Angus, Peter Jackson, and Greg Lovejoy split into two parties, with each party claiming a route on the same day.  Many more climbs were put up in the following days and weeks, including the classic climb <i>Tiptoe Ridge</i> (5), and in 1964 Steve Craddock and his father Bob produced the first Arapiles climbing guidebook on a school duplicating machine  (featuring 15 routes).

</p>
<p>
March 1965 saw the establishment of two significant climbs: <i>The Bard</i> (12) and <i>Watchtower Crack</i> (16). These climbs were done on the same day and are still regarded as classic climbs, often seeing numerous ascents per day. Activity steadily increased at Arapiles and in August 1966, Mike Stone and Ian Speedie released the second guidebook, <i>Mt Arapiles</i>. It was the first hardcover guide in Australia and featured 108 climbs. The rest of the 1960s saw many more new routes put up of increasing difficulty, with many including numerous <a>aid points</a>. The focus was on "getting up the climb... and staying alive", whether <a>free climbing</a> or not.

</p>
<p>
The early 70s saw a lull in activity at Arapiles as attention shifted to the <a>Grampians</a> and <a>Mount Buffalo</a>. Interest in Arapiles resurfaced in late 1973 with many imposing lines being climbed with a few aids. These routes brought a sense of accomplishment to the climbing community as new grades were continually being created. In 1975, American visitor "Hot" <a>Henry Barber</a> arrived and began freeing these routes with minimal <a>protection</a>. The 21-year-old made a significant impact at Arapiles, and his visit was a pivotal point in Australian climbing, as climbers worked to support the legacy of Barber by freeing their new lines instead of being content to leave in aid points.

</p>
<p>
Word of Barber's achievements spread and attracted a number of new young climbers to Arapiles. This group was later given the name "The New Wave" and throughout the rest of the 70s and early 80s they were responsible for scores of routes in the grade 20–25 range. The likes of <a>Kim Carrigan</a>, <a>Mike Law</a> and Mark Moorhead helped introduce a number of 26+ climbs, though the latter two did not often grade their climbs accurately (choosing to 'undergrade' them instead). This purposeful undergrading is known as "sandbagging" and is still common in Australian climbing (some would call it tradition), though not as much as it once was.

</p>
<p>
<a>German</a> climber <a>Wolfgang Güllich</a>'s ascent of <i><a>Punks in the Gym</a></i> in April 1985 was major achievement.  The route blasts up the middle of a blank, attractive orange wall and gave Arapiles (and Australia) international exposure. At the time it was graded 32 and was the hardest climb in the world, setting a new benchmark for difficulty. Following Güllich's triumph, a number of routes of similar difficulty have been put up, though none take the "easiest way up" such an impressive feature. It has a single chipped hold known as the 'birdbath hold' created by <a>Martin Scheel</a><span> [<a>de</a>]</span> before it was against ethics. In the early 1990s the hold crumbled, and a climber added glue to it, which remains to this day.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Arapiles is still a popular climbing destination, with some visitors staying for months at a time. The warm weather, accessibility, quantity and quality of climbs have helped to maintain the popularity of Arapiles with locals, Australians and international travellers alike.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="Philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>
Mount Arapiles is mainly regarded as a <a>traditional climbing</a> area – where climbers are expected to place their own protection, and remove it after climbing. The vast majority of climbs are therefore done using <a>removable protection</a> such as <a>nuts</a>, <a>cams</a> and RPs.

</p>
<p>
Arapiles also has a number of <a>sport climbing</a> routes. However, there are not many sport routes easier than 23. Popular bolted routes
can be found at the following areas: Dec Crag, Flight Wall and surrounds, Skyline Walls, The Bluffs, Strolling Wall, Castle Crag, The Pharos, Yesterday Gully, Doggers Gully, Poosticks Wall.

</p>
<p>
Many routes at Arapiles have lower-offs, so they can be approached from above or via an easier route. There is a strong tradition dating to the '80s of bringing the route down to your level, and it is now commonplace to rap in and pre-place gear. There are many routes with a mixture of fixed and natural gear for which this approach is suitable.

</p>
<p>
Chipping the rock to 'improve' holds is regarded as vandalism and is theoretically not tolerated. However, the many exceptions to this stance include routes such as: Steps Ahead, London Calling, 'Sean's route in The Bluffs', Ethiopia, Punks, Lord of the Rings, Wackford direct, Pet Abuse, Slopin' Sleazin' and Cecil B de Mille.

<p>
Development of new routes continues today, albeit at a slow pace. An Arapiles climbing guide update was started in March 2009, which records all new or changed routes at Arapiles since the publication of the 2008 guidebook. In 2011 the guidebook was released in both smartphone and tablet format.

<h3 id="Bouldering">Bouldering</h3>
<p>
There are a number of <a>bouldering</a> areas sprinkled around Arapiles that cater for all abilities. Two areas that are close to camp are the Krondorf Area and the Golden Streak Area. They are often populated in the late afternoon and early evening after the day's climbing has been done.

</p>
<h2 id="Camping">Camping</h2>
<p>
Centenary Park is a camp ground on the East side of the mount. Access is from Centenary Park Road. a fee is payable.
There are no powered sites, and campfires are only permitted between May and October. There is a toilet block with flush toilets.
