The rock formations have always been a site of worship for the ancient people of the area, however between the 13th and 14th century the twenty four monasteries were established atop the rocks.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> Meteora is located near the town of <a>Kalabaka</a> at the northwestern edge of the <a>Plain of Thessaly</a> near the <a>Pineios</a> river and <a>Pindus Mountains</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Meteora is included on the <a>UNESCO</a><a>World Heritage List</a>  under <a>criteria</a> I, II, IV, V, and VII.<sup><a href="#ref_5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The name means "lofty", "elevated", and is etymologically related to <i><a>meteor</a></i>.<sup><a href="#ref_6">[6]</a></sup>

<p>
Beside the <a>Pindos Mountains</a>, in the western region of <a>Thessaly</a>, these unique and enormous columns of rock rise precipitously from the ground. But their unusual form is not easy to explain geologically. They are not <a>volcanic plugs</a> of hard igneous rock typical elsewhere, but the rocks are composed of a mixture of <a>sandstone</a> and <a>conglomerate</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7">[7]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The conglomerate was formed of deposits of stone, sand, and mud from streams flowing into a delta at the edge of a lake, over millions of years. About 60 million years ago during the <a>Paleogene period</a><sup><a href="#ref_8">[8]</a></sup> a series of earth movements pushed the <a>seabed</a> upward, creating a high <a>plateau</a> and causing many vertical <a>fault lines</a> in the thick layer of sandstone. The huge rock pillars were then formed by <a>weathering</a> by water, wind, and extremes of temperature on the vertical faults. It is unusual that this conglomerate formation and type of weathering are confined to a relatively localised area within the surrounding mountain formation. The complex is referred to an exhumed continental remnant of <a>Pangean</a> association.<sup><a href="#ref_9">[9]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
This type of rock formation and weathering process has happened in many other places locally and throughout the world, but what makes Meteora's appearance special is the uniformity of the sedimentary rock constituents deposited over millions of years leaving few signs of vertical layering, and the localised abrupt vertical weathering.

</p>
<p>
The cave of Theopetra is located 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from <a>Kalambaka</a>. Its uniqueness from an archeological perspective is that a single site contains records of two greatly significant cultural transitions: the replacement of <a>Neanderthals</a> by modern humans and later, the transition from hunting-gathering to farming after the end of the last <a>Ice Age</a>. The cave consists of an immense 500 square metres (5,400 sq ft) rectangular chamber at the foot of a limestone hill, which rises to the northeast above the village of Theopetra, with an entrance 17 metres (56 ft) wide by 3 metres (9.8 ft) high. It lies at the foot of the Chasia mountain range, which forms the natural boundary between Thessaly and <a>Macedonia</a> prefectures, while the Lithaios River, a tributary of the <a>Pineios River</a>, flows in front of the cave. The small Lithaios River flowing literally on the doorsteps of the cave meant that cave dwellers always had easy access to fresh, clean water without the need to cover daily long distances to find it.<sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Excavations</a> and research and have discovered <a>petrified</a><a>diatoms</a> , which have contributed to understanding the Palaeo-climate and <a>climate changes</a>. <a>Radiocarbon dating</a> evidences human presence dating back 50,000 years.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup> The cave used to be open to the public, but is currently closed indefinitely, for safety inspections.<sup><a href="#ref_11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
<a>Vegetation</a> grows thickly out of the vertical rock walls many due to the water that one is able to find in the cracks and crevices that scale the cliff.<sup><a href="#ref_12">[12]</a></sup> Over the past several hundred years, the reports that the Meteora was easily accessible by foot have changed because now one must pass through a impenetrable jungle.<sup><a href="#ref_13">[13]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Being such massive unpredictable rock pillars, rock falls pose a constant threat to <a>pilgrims</a> and <a>tourists</a> of Meteora. An earthquake of magnitude 7 on the <a>Richter Scale</a> shook the rocks in <a>1954</a>, miraculously the thin pillars still stand today. In 2005, such a massive rock fell it closed the access road for days leading up to Meteora.<sup><a href="#ref_14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>
Caves in the vicinity of Meteora were inhabited continuously between 50,000 and 5,000 years ago. The oldest known example of a built structure, a stone wall that blocked two-thirds of the entrance to the <a>Theopetra cave</a>, was constructed 23,000 years ago, probably as a barrier against cold winds – the Earth was experiencing an <a>ice age</a> at the time – and many <a>Paleolithic</a> and <a>Neolithic</a> artifacts of human occupation have been found within the caves.<sup><a href="#ref_3">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_15">[15]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Meteora are not mentioned in classical <a>Greek myths</a> nor in <a>Ancient Greek literature</a>. The first people documented to inhabit Meteora after the <a>Neolithic Era</a> were an <a>ascetic</a> group of <a>hermit</a> monks who, in the ninth century AD, moved up to the ancient <a>pinnacles</a>. They lived in <a>hollows</a> and <a>fissures</a> in the rock towers, some as high as 1800 ft (550m) above the plain. This great height, combined with the sheerness of the cliff walls, kept away all but the most determined visitors. Initially, the hermits led a life of solitude, meeting only on Sundays and special days to worship and pray in a chapel built at the foot of a rock known as <a>Dhoupiani</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
As early as the eleventh century, monks occupied the caverns of Meteora. However, monasteries were not built until the fourteenth century, when the monks sought somewhere to hide in the face of an increasing number of <a>Turkish</a> attacks on <a>Greece</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> At this time, access to the top was via removable ladders or windlass. Currently, getting up there is a lot simpler due to steps being carved into the rock during the 1920s. Of the 24 monasteries, only six (four of men, two of women) are still functioning, with each housing fewer than ten individuals.<sup><a href="#ref_18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
<h3 id="History_and%20Construction%20of%20the%20Monasteries">History and Construction of the Monasteries</h3>
<p>
The exact date of the establishment of the monasteries is widely believed to be unknown, however there are clues to when each of the monasteries were constructed. By the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, a rudimentary monastic state had formed called the <a>Skete</a> of <a>Stagoi</a> and was centred around the still-standing church of <a>Theotokos</a> (Mother of God).<sup><a href="#ref_2">[2]</a></sup> By the end of the twelfth century, an ascetic community had flocked to Meteora.

</p>
<p>
In 1344, <a>Athanasios Koinovitis</a> from Mount Athos brought a group of followers to Meteora. From 1356 to 1372, he founded The Great Meteoron Monastery on the Broad Rock, which was perfect for the monks; they were safe from political upheaval and had complete control of the entry to the monastery. The only means of reaching it was by climbing a long ladder, which was drawn up whenever the monks felt threatened.<sup><a href="#ref_19">[19]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
At the end of the fourteenth century, the <a>Byzantine Empire's</a> reign over northern Greece was being increasingly threatened by Turkish raiders who wanted control over the fertile plain of Thessaly. The hermit monks, seeking a retreat from the expanding <a>Turkish occupation</a>, found the inaccessible rock pillars of Meteora to be an ideal refuge. More than 20 monasteries were built, beginning in the fourteenth century;<sup><a href="#ref_17">[17]</a></sup> only six remain today.

</p>
<p>
In 1517 <a>Theophanes</a> built the <a>monastery of Varlaam</a>, which was reputed to house the finger of <a>St. John</a> and the shoulder blade of <a>St. Andrew</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Access to the monasteries was originally (and deliberately) difficult, requiring either long ladders latched together or large nets used to haul up both goods and people. This required quite a leap of faith – the ropes were replaced, so the story goes, only "when the Lord let them break".<sup><a href="#ref_21">[21]</a></sup> In the words of UNESCO, "The net in which intrepid pilgrims were hoisted up vertically alongside the 373 metres (1,224 ft) cliff where the Varlaam monastery dominates the valley symbolizes the fragility of a traditional way of life that is threatened with extinction."<sup><a href="#ref_22">[22]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Until the seventeenth century, the primary means of conveying goods and people from these eyries was by means of baskets and ropes.<sup><a href="#ref_23">[23]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In 1921, <a>Queen Marie of Romania</a> visited Meteora, becoming the first woman ever allowed to enter the Great Meteoron monastery.<sup><a href="#ref_24">[24]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
In the 1920s there was an improvement in the arrangements. Steps were cut into the rock, making the complex accessible via a bridge from the nearby plateau. During <a>World War II</a> the site was bombed.<sup><a href="#ref_25">[25]</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="The_Monasteries%20of%20Meteora">The Monasteries of Meteora</h2>
<p>
At their peak in the sixteenth century there were 24 monasteries at Meteora in Greece. They were created to serve monks and nuns following the teachings of the Eastern Orthodox Church. Much of the architecture of these buildings is Athonite in origin. Today there are six still functioning, while the remainder are largely in ruin. Perched onto high cliffs, they are now accessible by staircases and pathways cut into the rock formations.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>
The Holy Monastery of Great Meteoron is the oldest and largest of the monasteries of Meteora. The monastery is believed to have been built just before the mid 14th century by a monk from Mount Athos named Saint Athanasios Meteorites.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> He began the build with a church in dedication to the <a>Mother of God</a>, the <a>Virgin Mary</a>. He later added small cells so that <a>monks</a> could concentrate and live atop the rock formations.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> The monastery’s second name is, The Holy Monastery of the <a>Transfiguration</a>, which got its name from the second church St. Meteorites built. The successor of Saint Meteorites was a monk <a>Saint Joasaph</a> who continued to build more cells, a hospital, and renovated the churches atop the rocks. The Monastery thrived in the 16th century when it received many imperial and royal donations.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup> At the time it had over three hundred monks living and worshipping within its cells. It is still a living monastery as there were three monks in residence as of 2015.<sup><a href="#ref_30">[30]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Being the biggest among all the monasteries allows it to have a particular layout filled with many buildings. The <a>katholikon</a> is dedicated to the <a>Transfiguration of Jesus</a> and was the first church of the monastery. The hermitage of the first founder of the monastery is a small building carved in rock. The kitchen  or what is commonly referred to as the <a>hestia</a> is a domed shaped building near the <a>refectory</a>. There is also a hospital, with its famous roof of the ground floor made of brick and supported on four columns. The three old churches or chapels include: The Chapel of Saint John the Baptist which lies next to the katholikon sanctuary, The Saints Constantine and <a>Helen</a> Chapel which is an aisle-less church with large <a>vault</a>, and finally the chapel of Virgin Mary situated in the cave.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_31">[31]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_32">[32]</a></sup>

<p>
The Monastery of Varlaam is the second largest monastery of Meteora. The name Varlaam comes from a monk named Varlaam who scaled the rocks in 1350 and began construction on the <a>monasteries</a>. Varlaam built three churches by hoisting materials up the face of the cliffs. After Varlaam’s death, the monastery was abandoned for two hundred years until two monk brothers, Theophanes and Nektarios Apsarades, came to the rock in the 16th century and began to rebuild the churches in October 1517.<sup><a href="#ref_33">[33]</a></sup> The two brothers from <a>Ioannina</a> spent twenty-two years hoisting materials to the top of the rock formation, however, the building only is reported to take around twenty days.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Monks have been present since the 16th century, however, there has been a constant decline in their presence since the 17th century.<sup><a href="#ref_34">[34]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup> Today the monastery is accessed through a series of ladders that scale the north side of the rock. The museum is open to travelers and contains a wide array of relics and ecclesiastical treasures.  As of 2015<sup><a>[update]</a></sup> that there are seven monks remaining in Varlaam.<sup><a href="#ref_20">[20]</a></sup>

<p>
The Monastery of Rousanou is believed to have been constructed, like many of the other monasteries, in the 14th century.<sup><a href="#ref_35">[35]</a></sup> The cathedral is believed to have been built in the 16th century and later decorated in 1540. The name Rousanou is believed to come from the first group of monks who settled on the rock from Russia.<sup><a href="#ref_36">[36]</a></sup> The monastery sits on the elevation 484 meters. Lying in the middle of the site, visitors can see the other monasteries, as well as the ruins of the Monastery of St. John the Baptist and the Pantokrator]<sup><a href="#ref_37">[37]</a></sup>

<p>
The Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas is located atop a small narrow rock. It is approximately eighty meters high and the first which the pilgrims encounter on their way to the holy Meteora. The Monastery was founded in the late 14th century and today is surrounded by the deserted and ruined monasteries of St. John Prodromos, the <a>Pantocrator</a>, and the chapel of Panagia Doupiani.<sup><a href="#ref_38">[38]</a></sup> The monastery served as a resting place for pilgrims and quickly got its name of “Anapausas” referring to  word <i>anapafseos</i> 'resting'.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup><sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup> Being on such a narrow surface, the floors are connected through an interior staircase. St. Nicholas is honored on the second floor where the <a>katholikon</a> is located. On the third floor, there is the <a>Holy Table</a> and the walls are decorated by 14th-century frescoes] The Monastery has been restored in the 16th century and again in the 1960s.<sup><a href="#ref_40">[40]</a></sup>

<p>
The <a>Monastery of the Holy Trinity</a> is believed to have been built in the 14th and 15th century. Even prior to this, ancient Greeks established hermitages at the base of the rock cliffs.<sup><a href="#ref_41">[41]</a></sup> In the 14th century, <a>John Uroš</a> moved to the Meteora and endowed and built monasteries on top of the rock cliffs. He offered the sanctuaries as a safe haven during times of political upheaval.<sup><a href="#ref_39">[39]</a></sup> In 1438, <a>Dometius</a> was said to be the first monk at the site of Holy Trinity. The actual monastery is believed to have been built between 1475 and 1476.<sup><a href="#ref_42">[42]</a></sup> Some do say that the exact construction date of the monastery like many of the other monasteries is unknown. By the end of the 16th century this was one of the last six monasteries still atop the Meteora.<sup><a href="#ref_26">[26]</a></sup>

<h3 id="Monastery_of%20St.%20Stephen">Monastery of St. Stephen</h3>
<p>
The Monastery of <a>St. Stephen</a> is located on a plateau-like structure. The original monastery was believed to have been built in the 14th century, however, a new <a>katholikon</a> was built in 1798 making it the newest of all the meteorite structures.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> The monastery is made up of many buildings including new katholikon, the "<a>hestia</a>" (kitchen), an old refectory that has since become a museum, and an assortment of rooms with different purposes.<sup><a href="#ref_44">[44]</a></sup> These include workrooms for paintings, embroidery, incense-making, and needlework. The church's interior was decorated with <a>frescoes</a> on the inside for a short period after <a>1545</a>. However, During the <a>World Wars</a>, the <a>monasteries</a> were bombed heavily and ransacked in the belief that the monks were holding refugees.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup> As of 2015<sup><a>[update]</a></sup>,  the Monastery of St. Stephen is home to 28 nuns after its conversion to a nunnery in 1961.<sup><a href="#ref_43">[43]</a></sup>
