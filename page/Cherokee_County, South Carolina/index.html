<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
This area was occupied for thousands of years by <a>indigenous peoples</a> and by the historic <a>Cherokee people</a> before European encounter.

</p>
<p>
When European traders and settlers entered the area, they used the existing Native American paths: called collectively the <a>Trading Path</a>. The Upper Road and Lower Cherokee Traders Path were paths that passed through the piedmont.  The former connected to <a>Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>, leading from the Virginia Tidewater into the Piedmont and to the South. The Lower Cherokee Traders Path especially connected areas in present-day western North Carolina, northern South Carolina and northeastern Georgia. In the mid-18th century, waves of British migrants and immigrants, an estimated 250,000 people, traveled by these paths into Cherokee and neighboring counties in the piedmont. This backcountry area was initially settled especially by immigrant <a>Ulster Scots people</a>, Germans and Anglo-Americans migrating into the area.

</p>
<p>
In later years, some plantations were developed and African-American slaves were brought into the area as labor.

</p>
<p>
The <a>Battle of Cowpens</a>, a  decisive engagement of the <a>American Revolution's southern theatre</a>, was fought on January 17, 1781, in northwestern Cherokee County, north of the town of <a>Cowpens</a>.

</p>
<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
According to the <a>U.S. Census Bureau</a>, the county has a total area of 397 square miles (1,030 km<sup>2</sup>), of which 393 square miles (1,020 km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 4.5 square miles (12 km<sup>2</sup>) (1.1%) is water.<sup><a href="#ref_4">[4]</a></sup> It is the third-smallest county in South Carolina by land area and fourth-smallest by total area.

As of the <a>census</a><sup><a href="#ref_10">[10]</a></sup> of 2000, there were 52,537 people, 20,495 households, and 14,612 families residing in the county.

</p>
<h2 id="Transportation">Transportation</h2>
<p>
The lifeline of Cherokee County, <a>I-85</a>, runs through the city limits of <a>Gaffney</a>. It carries traffic and trade contributing to the business development along Floyd Baker Blvd, the county's main thoroughfare, which bisects I-85. Much of the county's growth occurs along I-85.

</p>
<p>
The county is also served by <a>US 29</a>, which preceded I-85 and today is mostly used for local traffic. The major road in the downtown area of Gaffney was made part of US 29. Several of the major South Carolina highways that serve the county are: <a>SC Highway 11</a>, <a>SC Highway 150</a>, <a>SC Highway 105</a>, <a>SC Highway 18</a> serve the <a>Gaffney</a> area. <a>SC Highway 5</a> serves the <a>Blacksburg</a> area.

</p>
<p>
With no airports of its own, Cherokee County is served by <a>Charlotte/Douglas International Airport</a> and <a>Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport</a>. A study to determine the feasibility of building an airport in the county revealed that an airport is desperately needed by businesses. Previous studies have determined the structure of the airport and possible airport sites have been narrowed down to two sites - one located just south of Gaffney and one located outside of Blacksburg. A major economic feasibility study is now being conducted, as required for funding by the federal government. If the airport is economically viable, the government could contribute 95% of the funds needed to construct the airport, if the project is authorized by Congress. If the study fails, then no federal funding will be provided.

</p>
<h2 id="Nuclear_power%20plant">Nuclear power plant</h2>
<p>
In 2002, the President <a>George W. Bush</a> administration initiated the <a>Nuclear Power 2010 Program</a>, to encourage development of nuclear power plants to meet energy needs. The program developed streamlining of approval processes for licensing and had subsidies. Additional incentives were authorized under the Nuclear Power Act of 2005.

</p>
<p>
On March 16, 2006 <a>Duke Power</a> announced that a Cherokee County site had been selected for a potential new <a>nuclear power plant</a>, to be called the <a>William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station</a>, informally known as Lee Station.  The site is jointly owned by Duke Power and <a>Southern Company</a>.  Duke plans to develop the site for two <a>Westinghouse Electric Company</a><a>AP1000</a>  (advanced passive) <a>pressurized water reactors</a>.  Each reactor is capable of producing approximately 1,117 megawatts. (See <a>Nuclear Power 2010 Program</a>.) This site is adjacent to the old <a>Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant</a> site, which was never completed and ultimately abandoned. It was used by <a>James Cameron</a> as a set for the 1989 film <i><a>The Abyss</a></i>.

</p>
<p>
On December 14, 2007 <a>Duke Power</a> submitted a <a>Combined Construction and Operating License</a> to the <a>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>, with an announcement that it will spend $160 million in 2008 on the plant with a total cost of 5-6 billion dollars.<sup><a href="#ref_27">[27]</a></sup> Due to a slowdown in licensing and increase in costs, a federal license for what is estimated to be an $11 billion plant is not expected until 2016. Duke Energy will decide after that point whether to go forward with construction.<sup><a href="#ref_28">[28]</a></sup> In August 2017 Duke Energy announced that construction plans at the site had been put on an indefinite hold. But the company retains the rights to restart construction in the future.<sup><a href="#ref_29">[29]</a></sup>
