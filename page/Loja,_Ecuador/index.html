<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>
The city of Loja was colonized by Field Marshal Alonso de Mercadillo in 1548, and it is named for his hometown of Loja in <a>Spain</a>.  Originally located near La Toma in the <a>Catamayo</a> canyon since 1546, the city was relocated to its present location (about 35 km east) after a devastating earthquake and problems with <a>Malaria</a>. At nearly 500 years, it is one of the oldest cities in Ecuador. One of its founding-reasons for the Spanish colonizers was to have a fortified town next to the region of Zaruma, which was in that time rich in gold. It was as well a departure point for the <a>Amazon Basin</a> to search for the mystic town of <a>El Dorado</a>. The city was also visited by <a>Simón Bolívar</a> in his campaign to unite <a>Gran Colombia</a>. It declared its independence from Spain on November 18, 1820.

</p>
<p>
The city of Loja has the distinction of being the first city in Ecuador to be wired for electric power provided by a <a>hydroelectric dam</a> that was completed in the 1890s.

</p>
<h2 id="Geography">Geography</h2>
<p>
Loja is in the bottom of the broad glacial Cuxibamba valley.  It lies between the humid <a>Amazon Basin</a> and the Peruvian <a>sechura</a>, and is composed mainly of paramo, cloud-forest, and jungle.  The valley borders the <a>Podocarpus National Park</a>, which is a massive cloud-forest reserve accessible through the Cajanuma gates just minutes outside the city.  The <a>Rio Zamora</a> and <a>Rio Malacatos</a> flow through the city of Loja.

</p>
<h3 id="Climate">Climate</h3>
<p>
Loja has a mild Andean climate, generally warm during the days and colder and often wetter at night.  The average temperature is 16 °C (61 °F). June and July brings an eastern drizzle with the trade winds, and is referred to as the "windy season."  Due to its valley location, the city is often misty in the morning with general absence of sunshine, clearing off towards the afternoon.

<ul><li><b>Puerta de la Ciudad</b></li></ul>
<p>
The gates of the city are modeled after the Coat of Arms of the city, presented by King Felipe II of Spain in 1571.  The gate is on Av. Gran Colombia, and houses four galleries which show contemporary Lojano artwork, and a cafeteria and gift shop.  A stunning view of the city is found by climbing the clock tower.
Loja contains a number of historic churches; the city's board of tourism has approached finding them in a novel manner. Beginning at the Puerta de la Ciudad, one of the first thing a tourist will notice is a large orange stripe painted on the sidewalk.  Following the stripe takes the interested on a self-guided tour of the main historic churches and areas of Loja.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Cathedral</b></li></ul>
<p>
The main Cathedral, a masterpiece in the colonial style, is located on the central square.  It is home for six months of the year to the Virgin of Cisne, whose statue is carried on the backs of the faithful to and from the town of Cisne, 45 km north of Loja.  The procession shuts the road to traffic twice a year, and it is a mark of pride among Lojanos to participate.  Original adobe in the cathedral building dates from the 16th century; the current building dates from 1838 (previous edifices were lost to earthquakes). The Cathedral is one of the largest churches in Ecuador.  It is the seat of the <a>Roman Catholic Diocese of Loja</a>.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Church of San Francisco</b></li></ul>
<p>
The small Church of San Francisco houses the city's Franciscan convent.  The church was built in 1548 and then rebuilt in 1851.  The plaza, located on the corner of Av. Bolivar and Av. Colon, features a monument to Alonso de Mercadillo, founder of the city.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Church of Santo Domingo</b></li></ul>
<p>
The Church of Santo Domingo was built in 1557; the entire edifice was once in the Gothic style, but after an earthquake in 1867 only the twin spires remained standing.  The church was refinished in the colonial style, but the spires were left as a reminder of the former facade.  The church was painted and decorated by notable Lojano Fray Enrique Mideros.  In the plaza of the church stands a monument to Manuel Carrión Pinzano, a founder in 1853 of the Federalism movement in Loja.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Church of San Sebastian</b></li></ul>
<p>
In 1660, the city of Loja was consecrated to <a>St. Sebastian</a> in order to prevent destruction by earthquakes.  The present church dates from 1900.  Perhaps the most notable landmark of Loja stands on the Plaza San Sebastian (also called the Plaza of Independence) - the 32 meter clock tower commemorates the declaration of independence from the Spanish Crown on November 18, 1820.  The tower has four faces with brass bas relief depicting scenes from the city's history.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Monuments</b></li></ul>
<p>
There are numerous other monuments to famous Lojanos and Ecuadorians.  Central Square contains the monument to Bernardo Valdivieso, the founder of Loja's universities; a monument to Bolívar is housed in a park of the same name to commemorate his visit to Loja in October 1822.  A monument to Pío Jaramillo stands on the south end of the avenue bearing his name, and at the junction of Av. Jaramillo and Av. Carrión stands a monument to Benjamin Carrion.  A monument to Isidro Ayora stands in the roundabout in front of the bus terminal.  For more information on these and other historic Loja residents, see the section on notable natives and residents.

<p>
Next to Jipiro on the eastern and western shores of the Rio Zamora, is a huge greenspace with a public carting race track, riding trails, an orchid nursery, and the Loja zoo.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Parque Pucará de Podocarpus </b></li></ul>
<p>
On a hill called Pucará de Podocarpus, this is a children's park with playground equipment and a beautiful scenic view.  It is located on the city's former drinking water treatment plant.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Jardín Botánico</b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jard%C3%ADn_bot%C3%A1nico_Reinaldo_Espinosa">Reinaldo Espinosa</a></li></ul>
<p>
Across the road from University Park is the botanical garden which is open to the public and the oldest in Ecuador, created in 1949. There are over 800 native and exotic species. It is a living laboratory for scientific research and environmental education. It covers an area of 7 hectares divided into 5 sections for viewing. Most of the trees in this garden are over 40 years old, and the park is one of the world's highest-altitude botanical gardens.

</p>
<ul><li><b>Parque Universitario de Educación Ambiental y Recreación</b> "Francisco Vivar Castro"</li></ul>

Located opposite the Botanical Gardens about 5 km south of central Loja, the park covers 90 hectares and includes hiking trails, camping areas, and classrooms for environmental education.
